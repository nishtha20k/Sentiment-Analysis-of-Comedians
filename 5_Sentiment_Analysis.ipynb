My grandfather, who passed away, used to say\\u2026 A waitress would bring him water, and he would say, \\u2018What is that?\\u2019 And she\\u2019d say, \\u2018It\\u2019s water.\\u2019 And he said, \\u2018I\\u2019m thirsty, not dirty, so get me a drink.\\u2019 So cheers to my grandpa. Here we are, Chi Town. We did it. We came a long way. We\\u2019re here. I\\u2019m so happy to be back in this city. I\\u2019m back home. It\\u2019s amazing. I\\u2019m feeling the vibe again. You know what I mean? I took a walk around the lake. I was listening to conversations, two guys arguing, yelling at each other with that thick Chicago accent. You know, that\\u2026 Ah, Chicago. It\\u2019s Chicago. \\u2018A\\u2019 s are ahs. Chi-cah-go. And Ts are Ds. Over dere in Chi-cah-go. You know that? \\u2018A\\u2019s, ahs, T, Ds, everyone\\u2019s racist. It\\u2019s such a good city. What a city. I heard two men fighting. Two men were in an argument, in just a verbal argument, not anything bigger than that, just arguing, and the one guy goes, \\u2018You know what? Why don\\u2019t you suck my dick?\\u2019 And the other guy goes, \\u2018Pfft! You suck my dick.\\u2019 And I was like, \\u2018Hey, suck each other\\u2019s dicks, man.\\u2019 That would\\u2019ve been a fight to see, huh? Comes up like, \\u2018You motherfucker.\\u2019 Finish him. Finish him. We got to stop saying it like that. Guys have to stop saying it like that \\u2019cause girls are gonna start believing it. It has a negative connotation when you say that. You go, \\u2018Suck my dick.\\u2019 We say it negative. Suck my dick. You say it like it\\u2019s a bad thing. It\\u2019s the best thing in the world. It\\u2019s the best thing that\\u2019s ever happened to me. We should say it nice. You should go, \\u2018Hey! \\u2018Suck my dick, please, if you have time. \\u2018If you don\\u2019t, it\\u2019s not a big deal. I would love it a lot.\\u2019 I\\u2019m proud of being from this town. I love this town. I miss it a lot. It\\u2019s where my family is from. My family\\u2019s still here. It\\u2019s great to come home, see my parents. They\\u2019re getting older, which is weird. That\\u2019s a hard thing, to see your parents get older\\u2026 Like, honest older, You know when your parents just say shit that when you were a kid, you were like, \\u2018Oh, you never used to say shit like that when I was a kid.\\u2019 Like, my mom was like, \\u2018Well, I\\u2019m gonna leave the house. What are you gonna do for the weekend?\\u2019 And my dad was watching TV, and he turns, and he goes, \\u2018Eat steak, watch porn.\\u2019 I applaud the honesty out of that guy, really sharp. I appreciate that. Tell her the truth, man. They\\u2019re getting older. You know what I mean? They get older, but I love that about these people. They\\u2019re fantastic. They raised me. I mean, did they raise me correctly? I don\\u2019t know. Maybe not. I grew up here in downtown Chicago for half of my life in Chicago. In the second half, we moved to the western suburbs, right? We moved to the suburbs \\u2019cause my sister was born, and my parents were like, \\u2018I\\u2019 m not gonna fuck up two of them. \\u2018We can\\u2019t do that. One\\u2019s good. We\\u2019ll fuck up one. That\\u2019s okay.\\u2019 We moved to the western suburbs, you know, to try to better the life of all of us, but, like, I still realize sometimes how, like, my mom used to fuck with us subtly. Like, my mom is crazy. She\\u2019s a crazy person in the best way, but she would, like, lay it in real slow. Like, my parents were somewhat religious, right? You know, I mean, Irish Catholic kind of. You know what I mean? Like, somewhat in, you know what I mean? They\\u2019re, like, in the hot tub maybe. But she used to do this thing. She used to make me say, every single night before I went to bed, \\u2018Now I lay me down to sleep.\\u2019 Do you know that? Does anybody know that? I used to have to say this. I used to have to repeat this. I \\u2018d say,\\u2019 Now I lay me down to sleep. \\u2018I pray the Lord my soul to keep, \\u2018and if I die before I wake, I pray the Lord my soul to take.\\u2019 I would say that before bed, which is a really fucked-up thing\\u2026 for a child to say out loud. If I die before I wake up? I\\u2019m six. I\\u2019m gonna die in the middle of the night, and God\\u2019s gonna leave my body, take my soul, but be like, \\u2018Body\\u2019 s good. Leave the body. It\\u2019s fine. Leave it.\\u2019 What\\u2019s going on? Crazy person. I love her. She\\u2019s the best in the world. I had Irish Catholic guilt. I had so much Irish Catholic guilt when I was a kid, I used to flip a coin to determine whether or not I was gonna masturbate that day. You think I\\u2019m kidding? I would take a quarter. I would go, \\u2018Heads, yes, tails, no.\\u2019 I\\u2019d flip it, I\\u2019d get tails, and I\\u2019d go, \\u2018Ah, best two out of three. We got to go again. Let \\u2018s see what happens.\\u2019 He didn\\u2019t beat me, never won. That\\u2019s how heavy my guilt was. Seriously, that\\u2019s how, like, in my head I was about that God-is-watching-you type of stuff. Like, my mother used to let us not lock the doors. She was against it. She was like, \\u2018You don\\u2019 t lock the doors inside of the house. \\u2018If you\\u2019 re locking the doors inside of the house, it means you\\u2019re doing something you shouldn\\u2019t be doing.\\u2019 Yeah, that\\u2019s why we lock the doors. Don\\u2019t come in here. I\\u2019m pulling on my body. Get out of here. Leave me alone, lady. That\\u2019s how I realized the guy that invented locks inside of a house must\\u2019ve been caught masturbating by his wife one too many times. He was sick of it. He was sick of it. He\\u2019s like, \\u2018You know what? That\\u2019s it. I\\u2019m gonna put locks inside the house.\\u2019 She \\u2018s like,\\u2019 Michael, what are you doing? \\u2018We have locks on the outside of the house \\u2018to keep criminals from coming inside. There\\u2019s no criminals inside of this house.\\u2019 Yes, there are, Karen, and they\\u2019re robbing me of my freedom. Let me pull on my body in peace. Leave me alone, Karen. Anyway, I love being from this city, and now I live in Los Angeles, California. I live on the other side of this great country. I like it out there. It\\u2019s okay. It\\u2019s a second home for me. It takes some getting used to. It\\u2019s a little bit difficult, but the big difference is, like, when I come back home, you know, like, all my mom wants to do is talk about, like, the weather. Like, that\\u2019s a big thing. My mom is like, \\u2018How is the weather in California? Is it nice like this?\\u2019 It\\u2019s like, \\u2018Yeah, it\\u2019s better than this. That\\u2019s why I\\u2019m out there. What are you talking about?\\u2019 It\\u2019s always better. It\\u2019s always better. It is. There\\u2019s a lot of stuff that isn\\u2019t better, but the weather\\u2019s always gonna be better, and she loves bringing up the \\u2018feels like\\u2019 meter. You know what that is? The news guy. The news guy\\u2019s like, \\u2018It\\u2019s 62. Feels like 68.\\u2019 That\\u2019s Midwest hope. That\\u2019s hope circulating in your body. It\\u2019s the greatest lie ever told. Who\\u2019s the \\u2018feels like\\u2019 guy? I want that job. If that\\u2019s a job, I want it tonight. I\\u2019ll drop this bullshit gig and go do that tonight. The \\u2018feels like\\u2019 guy\\u2026 Greatest gig ever. Here in the studio, it\\u2019s 62 on the barometer. We\\u2019re gonna go live to Andrew Santino. Andrew, what does it feel like? How\\u2019s it going, news team? Like 67. Right back to you guys. Back to you guys, man. It\\u2019s nice, really nice out. It\\u2019s crazy, man, \\u2019cause the weather here fluctuates so much. Like, when I come back, you\\u2019re never surprised. Like, you\\u2019re never surprised by anything in Chicago, but, like, who I feel bad for when I come back is the homeless people. I always feel bad for homeless here, man. Like, I don\\u2019t feel bad for homeless people in L.A. People can get mad at me for saying that. I don\\u2019t give a shit. They\\u2019re awful human beings, these L.A. homeless people. They\\u2019re terrible. They\\u2019re terrible people. I feel bad for Chicago homeless, right? Because they die in the winter, and they die in the summer. They\\u2019re never not dying. They\\u2019re always dying. There\\u2019s, like, a week when it\\u2019s like, \\u2018We might make it,\\u2019 and that\\u2019s it, and they bucket-drum their way through that week. Soldiers, man. So I feel bad for homeless people in Chicago, from my heart, \\u2019cause this is my home. So, when I come home, I give money. I gave money today to a homeless guy. I\\u2019m not lying. I gave money to a homeless guy \\u2019cause I feel bad for him. I know what he\\u2019s got to go through. I gave that money to that guy, right? And I\\u2019ll always do that, but I also want to look him in the eye and go, \\u2018Hey, start walking south. You have nothing to do tomorrow. What are you doing here? You have something on your calendar? You don \\u2018t have a calendar.\\u2019 You can air-fistfight dragons all over this great country. I\\u2019m sure there\\u2019s half-smoked cigarettes strewn across this great land. I mean, the wind is their therapist. That\\u2019s all over the place. They can move about, man. You know the birds? You know those things? You know those guys? When they leave, follow those guys. Birds are born instinctively knowing, when it gets cold, to be like, \\u2018Oh, let\\u2019 s get the fuck out of here. \\u2018It\\u2019 s cold. Let\\u2019s leave. This is ridiculous. Why are we here? This is ridiculous.\\u2019 But I don\\u2019t feel bad for homeless people in Los Angeles at all\\u2026 I really don\\u2019t. I don\\u2019t. I don\\u2019t feel bad for them. Some people are like, \\u2018Oh, that\\u2019s kind of mean.\\u2019 I don\\u2019t give a shit. I don\\u2019t give a shit, \\u2019cause I live amongst these people, and they\\u2019re rude. They\\u2019re rude. You know why they\\u2019re rude? \\u2018Cause they made it. They\\u2019re at the promised land. It\\u2019s 72 degrees outside. You know what it is inside my place? Seventy-two. Who pays for that? I do. Fuck those guys. They won the lottery. They sleep on the beach. I came out of a restaurant, right? I came out of a restaurant. When I first moved there, I had no money. I had zero money. Came out of a restaurant, had some leftovers, went up to a homeless guy, said, \\u2018Hey, sir, I got some leftovers. Would you like this?\\u2019 Okay? I\\u2019m on a date, in front of a lady. Would you like this, sir? And the homeless guy looks up at me, and he says, \\u2018What\\u2019s in it?\\u2019 And I looked at him, and I said, \\u2018Tomorrow.\\u2019 Another day on this earth. What are you, gluten-free? Eat the food. You\\u2019re cock-blocking me, man. I\\u2019m trying to smash a five. Help me out. What are you doing? Why are you doing this? Times are tough. Who are you? But I like it. It\\u2019s my second home. This is my first home. L.A.\\u2019s my second home, and I do like it. There is things about it that I like. I live now in Los Angeles in a neighborhood called West Hollywood. West Hollywood is a gay neighborhood. It\\u2019s kind of like up here. It\\u2019s like where we are right now, Boystown. I like the gay neighborhood. The gay neighborhood is the best neighborhood. I\\u2019ve ever lived in in my life. It\\u2019s safe. It\\u2019s beautiful. I love it. I love it. You get in where you fit in, and I fit into that neighborhood, okay? I\\u2019m not gay, Dad, but\\u2026 I\\u2019m down to live around gay people. They keep it clean and safe. I\\u2019ve never been attacked once in my neighborhood, and by the way, if I did get attacked, I would love to be attacked. What a beautiful way to walk home. A guy leaps out of a bush. Where are you going? Where are you going? Where? Where? Gives me outfit tips. They can fly, you know. I have a lot of gay friends because of that. They\\u2019re people just like you and me. There\\u2019s nothing different. There\\u2019s nothing different about that neighborhood. It\\u2019s cleaner and safer, and I fucking love it. The only difference is, I got a big beard. I\\u2019ve had big beard. I got to keep a big beard for a while. And that\\u2019s okay. Gay guys love guys with beards. Why? I don\\u2019t know. It\\u2019s a thing. It\\u2019s an underbelly thing. It\\u2019s on the Internet. Look it up. And I often get hit on. I get hit on a lot, okay? I get hit on way more in the gay community than in the straight community, and I\\u2019m okay with that. It\\u2019s a confidence booster, fellas. It feels nice. But I\\u2019ve lived in a gay neighborhood for so long that now I\\u2019m picky about what gay guy hits on me. A gay guy hollers at me, and I\\u2019m like, \\u2018All right, you couldn\\u2019t handle it, dude. \\u2018You couldn\\u2019 t handle it. Too tight, too tight. \\u2018Keep walking, man. Pinch it right off. Get up out of here, man.\\u2019 Couldn\\u2019t have it. That\\u2019s some true shit. You got to be careful of social cues. Social cues mean a lot, right? And guys are stupid. Men are stupid. We\\u2019re stupid people by nature. We\\u2019re just dumb. We don\\u2019t give a shit, by the way, when girls are like, \\u2018Men are dumb.\\u2019 I don\\u2019t care. You think I care you think I\\u2019m dumb? I don\\u2019t give a shit. I know I\\u2019m dumb. It feels really good. Try going out your day without talking about a relationship. That\\u2019s what you guys do all day. It\\u2019s like, \\u2018I heard he was with her, but then she was\\u2019\\u2026 And we just walk around like\\u2026 It\\u2019s great. It\\u2019s fantastic. I don\\u2019t worry about shit. It makes my day so much easier, but guys are idiots, and I\\u2019m proud to be an idiot. But social cues amongst men are interesting because you got to be careful what you do in my neighborhood, right? Like, in my neighborhood, it\\u2019s a little bit different, \\u2019cause when I walk down the street and I see another guy, right, I do this thing. If I see you, and I walk down the street, right, we pass each other, and I go like this, what do you do? If I go like\\u2026 Yeah, you dude me right back, right. You dude me right back. He dudes me. We dude it. Hey, dude it. We dude it. Do we know why we dude? No. Zero clue. We walk around like pigeons all day like, \\u2018Hey, hey.\\u2019 We don\\u2019t give a shit. I do it to black guys to show them that I\\u2019m not a pussy. I go, \\u2018Hey, what\\u2019 s up? We good, we good? \\u2018We\\u2019re good. I\\u2019m good with the black guy. \\u2018In case a fight breaks out, we got a black guy. \\u2018We\\u2019 re good. We got one. We\\u2019re good, we\\u2019re good. We got him.\\u2019 I have no idea why we do that. We share genitalia. There\\u2019s no other reason that we do that to one another. But you can\\u2019t do that in my neighborhood \\u2019cause it means something totally different\\u2026 and it hurts. It hurts a lot. I like living there. I do like it. I really do. Like, I like living in Los Angeles. I like progressive culture, okay? I really do. I like the way that people think about other people as humans instead of a subset, right? This country got all up in arms. Everybody voted to make bathrooms gender-neutral. I don\\u2019t know if you know about that, but there was a big debate going on around this country about should we make bathrooms gender\\u2026 Should we be able to let other people use bathrooms that didn\\u2019t initially have that genitalia, right? People that are transsexual. Should we let them use our bathrooms? Ooh, careful. Who knows what could happen? What could happen? Nothing. They\\u2019re gonna shit in your bathroom that you shit in. You think your bathroom\\u2019s that important, where you let go of all your fluids. You care that much about your fluids that you care who comes after. When I go in there, I \\u2018m like,\\u2019 Aah! \\u2018There better be someone else decent that comes in after me. \\u2018I don\\u2019 t want some transsexual coming in after that. Who knows what they \\u2018ll do?\\u2019 Who do you think you are? It was a big debate, gender-neutral bathrooms. And I\\u2019m all for it. Bathrooms are bathrooms. I don\\u2019t give a shit who uses my bathroom after me. Use it. You got to go, go ahead. Use the bathroom, man. It\\u2019s a good thing. For years, I was sick and tired of going to a bar and seeing girls cut the bathroom line when theirs are too long. They walk to the guys, and they go, \\u2018Hi, our line\\u2019 s too long. \\u2018Do you think me\\u2026 Can we cut? Is this chill if we cut?\\u2019 I know that\\u2019s a stereotypical impression. I don\\u2019t give a shit. That\\u2019s real. \\u2018Can we cut?\\u2019 That\\u2019s real. And every asshole in line is like, \\u2018Yeah, go ahead.\\u2019 Also real, also real, also a real impression of us. You go like that. We go like that. Okay? So guys let them in, and I\\u2019m tired of that shit, \\u2019cause we can\\u2019t use your bathrooms. Guys can\\u2019t use girls\\u2019 bathrooms at bars. You can use ours. Why can\\u2019t we use yours? The only thing I ever hear is, \\u2018Well, you pee on the seat.\\u2019 Do we? I don\\u2019t. I don\\u2019t pee on the seat. If you live with someone that pees on the seat, it\\u2019s \\u2019cause they hate your fucking guts. They\\u2019re sending you a message. Oh, no, you get the groceries, Karen, you fucking bitch. Fucking asshole. He\\u2019s saying something to you. That\\u2019s between you two. What do you think? You think we walk in the bathroom, we just open it up, and let it go, and it\\u2019s, like, wherever it goes, it goes. I know where it goes. I got a laser pointer. I know precisely where it goes. Pff, right there. Pee on the seat. That\\u2019s amazing. It\\u2019s ridiculous. To me, I think the fix has always been remove the stalls from men\\u2019s bathrooms in bars. Remove them. Urinals or just holes in the ground, it doesn\\u2019t really matter. Guys will pee into anything. We don\\u2019t really give a shit. But get the stalls out of men\\u2019s bathrooms in bars because they shouldn\\u2019t be there in the first place, okay? They should never have been there, \\u2019cause a girl can\\u2019t walk in now and use a urinal. Unless you can, ladies, and then I want to see it. If you can tippy-toe pee, I would love to see it. I don\\u2019t know if it\\u2019s this way or that way. I don\\u2019t know which way is better, but if you can do that, I want to check it out. But there shouldn\\u2019t be stalls in men\\u2019s bathrooms in bars in the first place, because who the fuck is pooping at the bar? You\\u2019re gonna poop at the bar? You\\u2019re gonna poop here? Steve, you\\u2019re gonna poop at the bar. The bar that we\\u2019re at, you\\u2019re gonna poop at this bar? You feel okay with that as a person, pooping at the bar? Okay, now I know who you really are. Pooping at the\\u2026 Who are your friends? Who\\u2019s your family? Go home, you animal. What are you, you pig person? Poop at the bar? Are you out of your mind? You\\u2019re gross. You\\u2019re a gross human. You don\\u2019t poop at the bar. You man up if you have to poop. You man up if you have to poop. You finish your drink, pinch it off, and you walk home, so you can poop at the house naked like a grown-up\\u2026 like a full-grown adult. If you\\u2019re pooping at the bar that I\\u2019m at and I see you doing that, I\\u2019m gonna walk in, look under, walk out, and go, \\u2018Hey, there\\u2019 s a guy pooping here \\u2018wearing blue Adidas. Blue Adidas, yeah. He \\u2018s pooping right now.\\u2019 And then leave you with your mistake. Why is everybody looking at my shoes? \\u2018Cause you pooped here, Mike. What\\u2019s wrong with you? Get your life locked up, pig. Go home, you pig. Say that next time you see someone pooping in a bathroom. Walk in and go, \\u2018Go home, you pig. You make me sick.\\u2019 Unbelievable, man, how we prote\\u2026 We protect the bathrooms like they\\u2019re a big deal. Who gives a shit about the bathrooms? Dude, go to the bathroom. We protect bathrooms in this country like it\\u2019s something important. It\\u2019s remarkable to me. Sometimes you go to a restaurant, and you\\u2019re like, \\u2018Hey, can I get the key to the bathroom? It\\u2019s locked.\\u2019 They\\u2019re like, \\u2018Oh, yeah, we got the key. Here you go.\\u2019 It\\u2019s attached to a comically large ladle for no reason. You got a spoon on the goddamn thing. Now you got to take that in there, find a place for it. It\\u2019s gonna be a nightmare. Go ahead. You\\u2019re gonna hate every second of that. Why do we do that? We lock them. You keep the bathroom under lock and key? You realize in every restaurant, every restaurant you can walk right in, go right into the kitchen? There\\u2019s no locks on a kitchen. Just walk in and go, \\u2018Hey, what\\u2019s up, you guys?\\u2019 Dunk your hand in some soup. More salt. Needs more salt. I got to go. I want to use the bathroom. You got the key? No. Get real. It\\u2019s a weird country, man. We live in a weird country. We live in a weird time. I didn\\u2019t want to talk about anything that\\u2019s going on right now, but because I got a lot of time, it\\u2019s the late show, I\\u2019ll do whatever the fuck I want. So let me say this. I\\u2019m proud to be from where I\\u2019m from, okay? I\\u2019m proud to be from Chicago, Illinois. I\\u2019m proud to be from the United States of America. I\\u2019m not trying to get on a patriotic kick. All I want to say is, we got some fucked-up things going on in our country. Times are really crazy. It\\u2019s unfortunate as fuck. It\\u2019s awful. People on both sides are blaming people on both sides, okay? I have cops that are in my family. Every cop is not a bad fucking person, and every person isn\\u2019t a bad person, right? These are the same fucking things. So don\\u2019t point fingers at either side. We need to be better people in general, across the fucking board. That\\u2019s it. That\\u2019s it. Good. I\\u2019m a\\u2026 I\\u2019m a guy who recently, thankfully, found a woman who was dumb enough to stick around. Stupid girl, stupid girl. \\u2018Cause look at this, you know. Like, look at guys. You\\u2019re gross. Why would they even go for us? Why would a woman want to do stuff with you? You\\u2019re gross. You\\u2019re disgusting. Look at a naked woman. Take one look at a naked woman, right? Beautiful, symmetrical, hairless. What a creature. Whatever made it finely crafted it like a Ferrari, you know? Took time with it. And then they got to the guy, and they were like, \\u2018Ah, we ran out of time. \\u2018No, put the genitals on the outside. \\u2018It doesn\\u2019 t matter. \\u2018No one\\u2019 s gonna see. Who cares? \\u2018Hair? Throw some hair on it. Fine, throw some hair on it.\\u2019 It\\u2019s phenomenal. Every day we\\u2019ve fooled you. Like, we should wake up, guys, and just be like, \\u2018Ah, tricked them. \\u2018We tricked them again. We got away with murder.\\u2019 I don\\u2019t know how we ever convinced you to do anything in the first place. Kiss me where I pee? Kiss me where I pee? How? How? How? You know that place that you breathe and eat from? May I stuff my dick in there? Can I clog up your source of life with some flesh? Life, the life hole, can I just\\u2026 Cork it? I want to cork it. I want to cork your life hole with my body. How on earth did you say yes? Cork it? It\\u2019s a remarkable thing, when you think about it. Like, how did we ever even start the sexual chemistry to even get to that level of doing stuff? Here you go. A guy can go to a bar. A single guy goes to a bar trying to pick up chicks. He can go out there and mumble around. I want to put my body in your body. That\\u2019s all he\\u2019s saying. Baseline level, I want to put my body in your body. Can we do that? You sound debonair at the bar. You \\u2018re like,\\u2019 Well, well, I work for an investment firm downtown.\\u2019 But what you\\u2019re really saying is, like, \\u2018I want to put my body in your body. I\\u2019d like to put my body inside of your body.\\u2019 That\\u2019s all it is. You\\u2019re not that cool. You\\u2019re just trying to put some of your body in someone\\u2019s body. You got a gap. I got a wedge. Can we do the thing when I put the thing in the thing? That\\u2019s it. Think about that\\u2026 That\\u2019s a hard thing to do, to go out to a bar and convince a girl I\\u2019m the guy that you want to do things with. Think about how hard it was for us to start that. How did we start that? How did a caveman ever get to that point with a cave woman? How did a caveman say that when there was no language, no communication skills? First of all, when you were a caveman, you just stood around with your buddies, mumbling. That\\u2019s it. There\\u2019s really nothing going on, just a lot of\\u2026 Then one of you, out of nowhere, would just get an erection. Explain that to the crew. All your buddies are mad. Hey! They don\\u2019t like it pointing at them. You got to be a nonverbal dick salesman, going up to women like\\u2026 What are you selling? She doesn\\u2019t know. You can\\u2019t say it. Who said yes? The slowest girl in the pack\\u2026 on a bad leg she was lugging around. Okay, okay. Okay. How did that happen? The guy that convinced a girl to do that for the first time invented fire and the wheel that afternoon. It was like\\u2026 Everything clicked. I got it. Everything made sense. I would\\u2019ve loved to see the first caveman to discover pulling out. That would\\u2019ve been amazing. Right? The first guy that\\u2019s like\\u2026 That\\u2019s how all that shit on the wall got started. They were like\\u2026 What, do you think that was ink? That was no ink. It\\u2019s jizz symbols. How great is that fucking thing? My buddy\\u2019s an artist, and I was like, \\u2018I want a fucking papa bear \\u2018with a cubby bear with a Blackhawks headdress, \\u2018and I want him wearing Jordans for the Bulls \\u2018and white socks, and I want him eating deep dish and drinking a beer.\\u2019 And my buddy smoked enough pot as I did, and he came up with this. So it was fucking pretty amazing. The Chicago flag, yeah. Cool. It\\u2019s cool. We got a lot of pride in this town, so we should. You know what I mean? You can\\u2019t fuck with us. Come fuck with us. Where\\u2019s my crane camera? Come fuck with us, rest of the United States. Where the fuck are you guys at? Come to Chicago. Rip your fucking throats out. I\\u2019m gonna get murdered on the road in Cincinnati in, like, three months. Shit. No, I got a lady. I got a lady this year. I got locked up. I got married this year, which was great. It was a great thing. Don\\u2019t clap for that. Please don\\u2019t clap for that shit \\u2019cause it eggs her on, and I don\\u2019t need that. No, I got married, and it was great. It was very fun. We had a good time. Yeah, it was fun. Thanks a lot. Cool. It was cool, it was cool. She came up to me at the jump, and she was like, she \\u2018s like,\\u2019 What do you think about doing, like, bachelor, bachelorette parties, like, all that stuff?\\u2019 We didn\\u2019t talk about, like, really any of that stuff. We really kind of didn\\u2019t really get into the nitty-gritty, and I was like, \\u2018Well, whatever you want to do.\\u2019 She was like, \\u2018Do you want to have a bachelor party?\\u2019 And I was like, \\u2018I don\\u2019 t know. \\u2018Like, I do stand-up for a living, \\u2018so, like, it\\u2019 s just always kind of a fucking bachelor party. My life is kind of a bachelor party.\\u2019 I was like, \\u2018No, I\\u2019m good.\\u2019 You know what I mean? Like, I just took my best friend for his bachelor party, and I was like, \\u2018That\\u2019s good enough for me.\\u2019 I was like, \\u2018You can do a bachelorette party. Don \\u2018t feel like you can\\u2019t.\\u2019 She was like, \\u2018Are you cool with it?\\u2019 I was like, \\u2018I promise. I\\u2019m totally cool with it. Whatever you want to do, you \\u2018re good. Do it.\\u2019 She was like, \\u2018Okay, trust me. It \\u2018ll be classy.\\u2019 That\\u2019s some dumb shit. Girls are like, \\u2018It\\u2019 s gonna be classy. \\u2018The bachelorette party\\u2026 It\\u2019s gonna be cla\\u2026 I promise. We won\\u2019t be as crazy as you think we\\u2019re gonna be.\\u2019 She was like, \\u2018We\\u2019 re going to Northern California \\u2018to a vineyard. We \\u2018re gonna do wine tasting.\\u2019 So in girls\\u2019 brains, they think that we think that that\\u2019s nice and sweet, but I know the truth. I know they\\u2019re not wine tasting. I know they\\u2019re blacking out on wine. I know they\\u2019re getting purple toothed out, Charlie Chaplain-ing around town like\\u2026 I know. I know what you\\u2019re doing, looking like Grimace. I know. I know. Lie to me, you drunks\\u2026 trying to pretend like\\u2026 We pretend like wine is so sophisticated. It\\u2019s still booze. Stinky-foot grapes, that\\u2019s all it is. Go on a vineyard tour with her girlfriends. See, \\u2019cause here\\u2019s the thing about bachelorette parties. I\\u2019m sure every girl in this room is a wonderful human being. I\\u2019m sure you\\u2019re all stand-up citizens until you get in a bachelorette party, and then you\\u2019re a piece of shit. Then you\\u2019re a piece of shit. Then you storm around town like, \\u2018Look at us, penises everywhere. \\u2018Penises on our body. \\u2018Penis necklace. These are dick-laces. \\u2018These are dick necklaces. This is a dick hat. \\u2018These are dick glasses. They\\u2019re dick shoes. \\u2018Look at it. It comes. This one comes. \\u2018It comes out of that shoe. When I go like that, it comes.\\u2019 What\\u2019s wrong with you? Who are your parents? Shame on you, these women who walk around town doing that shit. It\\u2019s unbelievable\\u2026 Bachelorette parties that take over every bar they go to, screaming. These bitches work in HR during the day, but at night\\u2026 they\\u2019re just like, \\u2018Penis, penis, penis. Penis, penis, penis, penis.\\u2019 Who are your parents? Shame on you. You realize some little kid in China has to make those penis molds? Some little kid in China is pressing penises, penis sunglasses, so you can go out like, \\u2018Cocks, cocks on my head.\\u2019 You psycho. That\\u2019s where guys beat you. That\\u2019s, like, the one spot we beat you. We may be dumber than you, but we beat you there. We beat you by a landslide, because I have never been to a bachelor party where they\\u2019re like, \\u2018Santino, you ready to go? Put on your pussy costume. Let \\u2018s go.\\u2019 I put one on like\\u2026 \\u2018Come on, let\\u2019 s go. \\u2018Get mine wet. Steve, get mine wet. \\u2018Get it wet. Get the clit wet. \\u2018Go. Get it wet. This is what we want.\\u2019 \\u2018Vaginer.\\u2019 We beat you. So we went and got married out of the country. We went to Costa Rica. We went down to Costa Rica. It was great. Central America, beautiful place. Costa Rica is amazing. We loved it. It was fantastic. I didn\\u2019t know that racism is everywhere. I had no idea, but it is, but it really fucking is. Here we are in our hotel, two men are in a fight with one man, two guys on one, two on one, working this dude, and I look out the window, and I\\u2019m like, \\u2018Oh, my God, what happened?\\u2019 To the local guy. And the local guy, who we know, who we\\u2019re buddies with, is like, \\u2018Oh, yeah, the fight?\\u2019 And I was like, \\u2018Yeah, what happened?\\u2019 I\\u2019m ready for the story. And he \\u2018s like,\\u2019 Okay, you see this guy on the ground? \\u2018You see him on the ground, \\u2018this guy who they kick in the face? \\u2018You see him? \\u2018You know, this guy on the ground they kick in the teeth. You see him?\\u2019 I was like, \\u2018Yeah, yeah, definitely. Yeah, what is that?\\u2019 And he goes, \\u2018Oh, yeah, this guy, this guy on the ground, he \\u2018s from Panama.\\u2019 What? \\u2018He\\u2019 s from Panama. Panama, the country. Panama.\\u2019 That\\u2019s it? That was as deep as the well got dug. \\u2018He\\u2019s from Panama.\\u2019 That\\u2019s it. I was like, \\u2018But how did the fight\\u2026 Like, how did you\\u2026 How did the fight happen?\\u2019 He goes, \\u2018Oh, s\\u00ed, s\\u00ed, s\\u00ed, s\\u00ed, s\\u00ed, s\\u00ed. \\u2018Okay, so this guy on the ground, \\u2018he cut off this guy in traffic, \\u2018and he says to him, \\u2018Hey, what the fuck?\\u2019 \\u2018And this guy, he says, \\u2018Hey, man, fuck you.\\u2019 \\u2018So this guy, he gets out of his car, \\u2018and he says, \\u2018Mm-mm, fuck you.\\u2019 \\u2018So then they yell at each other. \\u2018So this guy say fuck you. \\u2018This guy, fuck you. This guy, fuck\\u2026 So both of these guys are fucking you right now.\\u2019 I was like, \\u2018No one\\u2019 s fucking me. What are you talking about?\\u2019 \\u2018And then his friend, he hear him from across the street, \\u2018and his friend, he says, \\u2018Hey, what happened?\\u2019 \\u2018He says, \\u2018He said, fuck you.\\u2019 \\u2018He says,\\u2019 Ah, fuck you.\\u2019 \\u2018He says, \\u2018Fuck you.\\u2019 He says. \\u2018Fuck you.\\u2019 He fuck\\u2026 these guys over here are fucking you.\\u2019 \\u2018And the one guy, he says to him\\u2026 \\u2018Before he fight with him, he says, \\u201dHey, motherfucker, where are you from?\\u2019 \\u2018And this guy, he says, \\u2018Panama.\\u2019 \\u2018And, uh\\u2026 That \\u2018s it for him.\\u2019 Other than that, it was a beautiful country, man. It was gorgeous, man. We did so much white-people shit. It was unbelievable. You know what white-people shit is. Everybody in here knows it, right? It\\u2019s, like\\u2026 We went zip-lining. It\\u2019s, like, white-water rafting, all that white-people\\u2026 White-water rafting is white-people shit. It\\u2019s called white-water rafting. It\\u2019s ours. That\\u2019s some white-people shit. You\\u2019ll never, ever see a black guy white-water rafting, skydiving, drinking coffee. That\\u2019s just not what they do. It\\u2019s not what they do. Skydiving, all that shit. Black guy, do you go skydiving? Never in your fucking life, man. No way. Never in your life. Rock climbing? No way. White-water rafting? No. None of the above. Do you even like coffee? I do like coffee. Oh, come on, man. What did he say? I like it black. You like it black. I get that. I get that. You can have that. Take it black. Take it black. So he knows what I\\u2019m talking about. He knows. I went to college with\\u2026 One of my closest friends in college was this dude we lived with, and he would always make fun of me. He \\u2018s like,\\u2019 You\\u2019re doing some white-people shit, Red. You on some white-people shit right now.\\u2019 I was like, \\u2018I\\u2019m taking out the trash.\\u2019 He\\u2019s like\\u2026 \\u2018That\\u2019s the type of shit I\\u2019m talking about, motherfucker. \\u2018Just throw that shit outside, bitch. \\u2018White-people shit! \\u2018What you doing, dishes, motherfucker? You white-ass motherfucker.\\u2019 What you doing, laundry, you Charmin-ass motherfucker? You Charmin\\u2019\\u2026 I did so much white-people shit in Costa Rica. It was bananas. I loved it, though. I love being a tourist. Like, that\\u2019s the fucked-up thing about Americans. We don\\u2019t want to be tourists. Why not? Why are we so afraid of being tourists? I\\u2019ll do that zip-line dork-ass shit. Give me the helmet. I love that. How much is the picture? $1,000? I don\\u2019t give a shit. I\\u2019ll pay for that, plan for it. Come on, man. Give me that dork tourist shit. We\\u2019re so afraid as Americans to be tourists. Yet for some reason, tourists come here. They\\u2019re not afraid to be tourists. You can go to Michigan Avenue right now. There\\u2019s a cute little Italian couple that\\u2019s like, \\u2018Mi scusi, mi scusi, mi scusi. The water tower, the water tower.\\u2019 And you \\u2018re like,\\u2019 Ah, come here. Let me lie to you. Come here, come here, come here.\\u2019 Let them be tourists, man. Be a tourist. Be a tourist. All I\\u2019m saying is, stop being such a liar. Be who you really are. You\\u2019re out of the country. Be out of the country, man. There\\u2019s nothing wrong with that, you know. Here\\u2019s why. Every time I\\u2019ve ever been to a Spanish-speaking country, there\\u2019s always one guy in the crew, one dude who\\u2019s like, \\u2018Hey, I got us. I can take us around. \\u2018I speak a little bit of Mexican. \\u2018We\\u2019 re gonna be good. We \\u2018ll be good.\\u2019 You speak Mexican, Brad? I speak Mexican, dog. I got us. Don\\u2019t sweat it, man. I took 101 in high school. We\\u2019re gonna be straight. And you\\u2019re like, \\u2018All right, man. I can\\u2019t wait.\\u2019 You walk into a restaurant. I say the truth. I walk in, I go, \\u2018Hello, American, americano, \\u2018American, ready to be ripped off. Look at me.\\u2019 \\u2018Cause I don\\u2019t give a shit. How much is that Coke? Seven? Thought it was ten. You can\\u2019t fuck me. You can\\u2019t fuck me. I planned for that. You cannot fuck me. But he walks in. Brad walks in, talking Mexican like, \\u2018Hola, seniors. Hola, seniors.\\u2019 He thinks he\\u2019s the shit. Brad walks in heavy, and the staff looks at him like, \\u2018Okay, okay, okay, okay. \\u00bfHabla espa\\u00f1ol, se\\u00f1or? \\u00bfHabla espa\\u00f1ol? \\u00bfHabla espa\\u00f1ol?\\u2019 S\\u00ed, s\\u00ed, sen-yours. S\\u00ed, s\\u00ed, sen-yours. Ha-blah a-spaniel. Ha-blah a-spaniel. Ha-blah a-spaniel. And they \\u2018re all like,\\u2019 Okay. \\u2018Hmm. Good, good, good. That\\u2019s good, good. That\\u2019s good.\\u2019 And they just machine-gun Spanish at his fucking head until you see him go, \\u2018Oh, fuck. \\u2018There\\u2019s no bibliotecain there. Where\\u2019s the ban-yo? I don\\u2019t know any of those words.\\u2019 Brad looks like an asshole. Meanwhile, I\\u2019m enjoying my plate of rice and \\u2018polo,\\u2019 having a great time\\u2026 enjoying my life. I came back from Costa Rica. It was fantastic, and then we got into that, like, all the marriage discussion shit. She was like, \\u2018What do you want to do about the last name?\\u2019 I was like, \\u2018I don\\u2019 t know. I mean, I don\\u2019t really care. I don\\u2019t think I really care.\\u2019 I was like, \\u2018I mean, what do you want to do?\\u2019 She\\u2019s like, \\u2018Well, do you want me to take your last name?\\u2019 And there\\u2019s a part of you that\\u2019s like, \\u2018No, man, it\\u2019s cool.\\u2019 Then there\\u2019s a part of you that\\u2019s like, \\u2018Yeah, you got to take the last name.\\u2019 It\\u2019s some male-ego bullshit, but that\\u2019s the truth of the situation. Like, it doesn\\u2019t really mean much. Like, what are last names anyway? I don\\u2019t really know. We don\\u2019t really know, you know. Last names\\u2026 you used to give to somebody \\u2019cause it represented land, right? You had some land. You get some land to give. Like, \\u2018This will all be yours one day.\\u2019 That doesn\\u2019t mean shit nowadays. I can\\u2019t be like, \\u2018Son, this condominium will be yours when I die.\\u2019 Who gives a shit, right? There\\u2019s not much to it. You know, it really doesn\\u2019t mean much. But it\\u2019s strange when I think about, like, white people\\u2019s last names, like, where our last names came from. A lot of times, it used to be your occupation, right? Like, I meet a guy\\u2026 Kevin Blacksmith. His great-great-great-great- grandfather was a blacksmith. Dave Shoemaker, his great-great-great-great- grandfather was a shoemaker. But it\\u2019s weird when you meet a white guy named Eric Lynch\\u2026 \\u2018Cause you\\u2019re like, \\u2018Your great-great-great-great- grandfather was a bad person.\\u2019 Switch it up, dog. But last names are kind of bullshit. You know know what I mean? They mean whatever they want and whatever you want them to mean, and so she said, \\u2018What do you want to do?\\u2019 I said, \\u2018How about we just go with whosever last name is cooler?\\u2019 Right, whosever\\u2019s is cooler. She was like, \\u2018Cooler?\\u2019 I was like, \\u2018Yeah,\\u2019 \\u2019cause in my head, I knew it was already game over. I was like, \\u2018Jordan, buckets.\\u2019 I knew it was over. I knew it was over. She wasn\\u2019t fucking with Santino. What a cool-ass name, Santino. Three syllables\\u2026 San, unh, ti, got you, oh. That\\u2019s what\\u2019s up. I had it. It was in the bag, man. It was in the bag. It was game over. Jordan. It was game over, but then she was like, \\u2018Oh, you think your last name is that much cooler?\\u2019 I said, \\u2018Yeah.\\u2019 Her last name was Eichelberger. You want me to say it again? Eichelberger. And she\\u2019s like, \\u2018What\\u2019s wrong with that?\\u2019 I was like, \\u2018What\\u2019 s right with that shit? What are you talking about, lady?\\u2019 She\\u2019s like, \\u2018It\\u2019s not that big of a deal.\\u2019 I said, \\u2018Well, it\\u2019s like part of the Third Reich.\\u2019 I\\u2019ll have to walk into restaurants, like\\u2026 \\u2018We\\u2019 re here for the Eichelberger party, \\u2018the party of two. \\u2018There is two of us at the party. \\u2018We would like the table in the back of the room. \\u2018In the back of the room, \\u2018behind the air-conditioning, please. Thank you.\\u2019 Anyway, she\\u2019s a Santino now. Yeah. We got into a thing, \\u2019cause I was\\u2026 I feel like I\\u2019m watching too much porn lately, if I\\u2019m just being real with you guys. We\\u2019re getting real. It\\u2019s a late-night show. I was watching too much porn. Porn is bad. It\\u2019s a bad thing. It\\u2019s really addictive. It is. It truly is. I think it\\u2019s not my fault, though. I think it\\u2019s access\\u2026 access, too much access. In your pockets, there\\u2019s a phone, right? In there is all the porno\\u2026 All of it\\u2026 all of it that we make. All of it that we make, you guys. If I had three seconds inside of a time machine, I would \\u2018zorb\\u2019 myself to when I was 14, for three seconds, and just go\\u2026 \\u2018In the future, all the porno\\u2019s in your pocket,\\u2019. And get out\\u2026 and blow my mind. Just\\u2026 semen everywhere. Oh, my God. I\\u2019m waiting for this JPEG to load. Come on, man. That\\u2019s crazy. That is crazy to think about. It really is too much access. Like, I can\\u2019t walk past a laptop without being like\\u2026 \\u2018Ah, this is Best Buy. I got to go.\\u2019 The Blue Shirts, they don\\u2019t like that. You know what I mean? They get weird. We\\u2019ve seen so much of it. The problem is\\u2026 With porn is, it\\u2019s got this stigma where we think we can emulate that stuff. Like, you think you\\u2019re like them. You\\u2019re not like them. Those are pros, man. Those are pros. I got envy. I have envy, envy. The way that these men throw a rope is remarkable. They just\\u2026 It takes off. It\\u2019s got loft. Are you kidding me? I\\u2019m lucky if mine comes out. It\\u2019s like a pensive army. It gets to the surface, and it \\u2018s like,\\u2019 No, no. Go back, go back.\\u2019 And when it does come out, it\\u2019s late for the party. It has nonalcoholic beer. It\\u2019s like, \\u2018Sorry. We\\u2019re here.\\u2019 My wife\\u2026 one night she was like, \\u2018Oh, come on my tits.\\u2019 I was like, \\u2018Oh, I\\u2019ll never make it up there.\\u2019 It\\u2019s so far. It\\u2019s too far. Maybe your belly button, max\\u2026 if I really put in the work. I\\u2019ll tell you what I\\u2019ve been watching a lot of. I\\u2019ve been watching a lot of black porn, lots of black porn. Blackblack. Too. Like, chocolate, chocolate, chocolate, chocolate. Deep chocolate, 99% cacao chocolate. Sexy. No milk. Get out of here, milk chocolate. No time for you. Chocolate, chocolate. I love watching black porn, love watch\\u2026 For one fundamental reason. The guys get to wear shoes\\u2026 on their feet. Men wear shoes on their feet. If you know anything about how shoes and pants work, anything at all, you know that these men took off their shoes, took off their pants and underwear, and then put back on their shoes. Come on. You did it again, black people. Numero uno. I got the envy, man. It\\u2019s a bad thing. It really is. It\\u2019s a bad thing. We need to clean up our minds, clean up our life. You know what I mean? Get clean, clean living. Eat a smoothie, take a walk. It\\u2019s difficult, man. It\\u2019s difficult to do. People always\\u2026 like, listen, I try to work out. I\\u2019m trying to be in shape. I\\u2019m trying to do all that stuff. It\\u2019s a hard thing to do. You know, fast food, going to get fast food always reminds me of what it was like when I was single, going to a one-night stand. It was like the same thing, like the exact same feeling. You\\u2019ll be looking on Google Maps to try to find out if that fast-food joint\\u2019s open, right? You\\u2019re like, \\u2018You up, McDonald\\u2019s? You up?\\u2019 You send a late-night text, like, \\u2018What\\u2019 s up, girl? \\u2018You up? What\\u2019s up, McDonald\\u2019s? \\u2018You up? What\\u2019s up, Mac D\\u2019s? Is you up, playboy? Give me them nuggets.\\u2019 She\\u2019s like, \\u2018Uh-huh.\\u2019 McDonald\\u2019s is like, \\u2018You know it.\\u2019 You cruise over there, and on the way, you\\u2019re like, \\u2018Ooh, it\\u2019 s gonna be good. \\u2018I know what I get at this location. \\u2018This is my favorite spot to go to at this time of night. That number two is my spot right now.\\u2019 That\\u2019s a butt joke. You get over there, and you eat that. You devour that McDiesel\\u2019s. Just like that, you\\u2019re like\\u2026 Devour it. And when you\\u2019re done, you get in the car and cruise home\\u2026 Same feeling. Cruising home, and you\\u2019re like\\u2026 \\u2018I\\u2019m a bad person, man.\\u2019 Sad. I had to cut that out. I had to cut it out, man. I\\u2019m trying to stay healthy. I\\u2019m trying to fit into my own skin. That\\u2019s really what it is. You know, I\\u2019m trying to feel good about myself. It\\u2019s a confidence thing about people. You want to feel confident and cocky, but, like, not too much. Like, I had my ego tested. I got into a car accident. A man hit me. A man hit me. I was at a red light. A man hit me, okay? Red light, skrrr, man, bmm-bmm-bmm, hit me, and I got out of my car. He got out of his car, and I went to say something. Before I could say anything, he goes, \\u2018Hey, what the fuck?\\u2019 And I said\\u2026 \\u2018That\\u2019 s my line. \\u2018I say that. That\\u2019s me. \\u2018I\\u2019m doing\\u2026 That\\u2019s what I do. You say, \\u2018I\\u2019m sorry,\\u2019 I feel like.\\u2019 He was a big-ass dude. He was big, jacked up, and he had tattoos up to his face? Question mark. You good, bro? On your face? You cashed out? You got cancer? What\\u2019s up? On your face? I feel like that\\u2019s some, like, \\u2018I don\\u2019t give a\\u2026 \\u2018Whatever, bro. Go ahead. It\\u2019s done. \\u2018I don\\u2019 t give a shit. \\u2018I\\u2019 ve been collecting Marlboro miles for years. I \\u2018ll cash out.\\u2019 On your face? So I had no way to win this war. This dude was in my face. I had no\\u2026 I was backed up. I was like, \\u2018Whatever, man.\\u2019 And in that moment, I was like, \\u2018I can\\u2019 t win this argument with this dude. I can \\u2018t beat him physically.\\u2019 But I was like, \\u2018If I had a superpower right now, \\u2018you know, it wouldn\\u2019 t be to, like, fly or be invisible. I would love to be able to throw acne on somebody.\\u2019 Right? He\\u2019s all, \\u2018Fuck you.\\u2019 I\\u2019m like, \\u2018Fuck me? Fuck you, man.\\u2019 No! Hit him all over the body, shoulder, bacne. Hit him with the bacne. Hit him with the kn-acne, that knee acne. Light him up, light him up. Scar him physically and emotionally, send him home like that for a couple of weeks, depending on the topical cream. Let it sit. Let it sit. If you\\u2019re not laughing at that, you didn\\u2019t have acne when you were a kid. I had really bad acne when I was a kid, man. It was so bad. It was so bad. Like, acne is, like, the sole reason I questioned God. I\\u2019m like, \\u2018What up, dude? What\\u2019s the deal? \\u2018Where are you at on this one, player? This is ridiculous.\\u2019 Here you are, 13, 14 years old. You\\u2019re the ugliest version of yourself. Look at photos of you at 14. TBT them on Instagram, and you\\u2019re like, \\u2018Ooh, tough-looking kid.\\u2019 You\\u2019re ugly, bro. You are ugly at 14. Teenagers are so gross to look at, hard to see. They\\u2019re hard to see, bro. They\\u2019re skinny. Their voices are crackling. They\\u2019re wobbling all over like little skinny baby giraffes, just hungry and horny like\\u2026 Nasty-looking crea\\u2026 They look like Tim Burton cartoons. They\\u2019re barely alive. You are nasty as a child. And you\\u2019re telling me at this vulnerable point in your life, God is gonna be like, \\u2018You know what? \\u2018I\\u2019 m gonna put some red pus bumps on his face. Pus bump his face up.\\u2019 I didn\\u2019t get it. I didn\\u2019t understand it. I had it so bad. I had to go on Accutane. You used to have to sign a form that said. \\u2018I can die from this medication.\\u2019 What\\u2019s up, guys? What are we saying? I can die from this medi\\u2026 I can die from this medication. And I was underage, so I had a legal guardian. So my mother had to sign it. I was 16. I\\u2019ll never forget. They slipped the sheet to my mother, and she looked at it, and then she looked at me. Yeah. Yeah, this is\\u2026 it\\u2019s\\u2026 it\\u2019s better than your face. It doesn\\u2019t really matter. You\\u2019re an ugly kid. You\\u2019re ugly. It\\u2019s\\u2026 it\\u2019s for you. I had it so bad. I had acne so bad when I was young. When I was in high school, I played basketball for a couple years at my high school until I found out about drugs, and I was like, \\u2018See you later, basketball.\\u2019 Ah, true story. But I played basketball for a little while. When I played basketball, I made the JV team pretty early on, and we played in a summer league, okay? In the summer league, you had to play all the other schools that you were going to play in that regular season, and I\\u2019ll never forget. We went out to West Aurora to go play these guys, and they were supposed to beat us. They were, like, a really good school, right? They were really good. They were an all-black school. We were a some-black school. They were gonna beat us. Bottom line, they were gonna win. And we went out there, and we beat the shit out of these guys. I had the game of my life. I dropped four points. I was on fire. If you know anything about high-school basketball, four points is like, whoa. What are you, MVP? Final score, 12-2. It was a blowout. I mean, we went out there. I had a great game. I was on cloud nine. I felt like a king. Then I left, and I went out to the hallway to go get a drink of water. I\\u2019m getting a drink of water, bending down by the water fountain to have a drink of water. A little black kid, like, eight years old walks in the hallway. Comes up to me and goes, \\u2018Hey, yo, white boy. White boy.\\u2019 I go, \\u2018What\\u2019s up?\\u2019 You\\u2019re pretty good, man. Oh, thanks, man. He goes, \\u2018For a white boy.\\u2019 And I was still like, \\u2018Thank you. I appreciate that.\\u2019 I\\u2019ll take it. Then he goes, \\u2018All right, man.\\u2019 I go, \\u2018All right, man.\\u2019 He walks away. Felt good. Go down to get some more water. He gets to the doorway. He stops\\u2026 real Forest Whitaker-style. He turns around and goes, \\u2018Hey, yo, white boy.\\u2019 I say, \\u2018What\\u2019s up, man? What up?\\u2019 He goes, \\u2018What the fuck is all over your face?\\u2019 That still hurts today. I\\u2019m in my 30s. That cut went all the way to the bone. You know what I mean? Then I walked up to him slowly, and I said, \\u2018Well, this is what happens when your dad sticks around.\\u2019 No, I didn\\u2019t say that. That\\u2019s a joke, man. No, I called him the N word. Then I got out of there as fast as I could. No, stop it. I cried on the bus, man. I cried on the bus. Got to have a sense of humor, man. But I always loved black people. I always did. I really did. I still do. I still do love black people, man. I think they\\u2019re fantastic human beings. Black people always accepted me. Black people really did. White people never liked me. White people don\\u2019t like redheads for some reason. There\\u2019s this thing. White people see redheads, and they\\u2019re like, \\u2018What do we do with it?\\u2019 They don\\u2019t like us. They don\\u2019t trust us. They make a day to kick us. Call us names\\u2026 \\u2018You fire crotch, you ginger.\\u2019 They ask us stupid questions, like does the carpet match the drapes? A black guy\\u2019s never said that to me. White guys\\u2026 \\u2018The carpet match the drapes, bud?\\u2019 And I\\u2019m always like, \\u2018Are you a grown-up asking \\u2018about my penis hair? \\u2018Is that the level that you\\u2019re on? \\u2018You\\u2019 re worried about my penis hair, dude. \\u2018If you must know, it\\u2019s hardwood floors. There \\u2018s no carpet there, bro.\\u2019 I clean it up. Go get you a little buzzer from Target and clean that shit up. You get under there. It\\u2019s like\\u2026 It\\u2019s working overtime under there. That\\u2019s the no-fly zone, no-fly zone. It might die under there, like\\u2026 I can\\u2019t, I can\\u2019t. White people never liked me. They never did. They always made fun of me. That\\u2019s a reality check. Now people are like, \\u2018Huh? What are you talking about?\\u2019 White people always made fun of redheads. Redheads are this outcast. We\\u2019re this weird minority for some reason, but black people always liked me. They really did. They took to me. Like, black people like white people with a deficiency. I\\u2019m like a dog with one bad leg. You know, white people don\\u2019t adopt that dog, but black people are like, \\u2018No, no, no. \\u2018He good, he good, he good. \\u2018He gonna be fine. Come here, Tripod. \\u2018He gonna be fine. Tripod. \\u2018Come here, Tripod. It gonna work out.\\u2019 That\\u2019s just the truth. It just made me feel normal when I was a kid. So I loved hip-hop culture. I loved everything all my black friends liked, so much so that in the \\u201990s, people used to say this word. People used to call me a \\u2018wigger.\\u2019 Do you remember that word? Don\\u2019t get uncomfortable. You all said it. You all said it. I don\\u2019t know why we got rid of it. It was hilarious. You should\\u2019ve stuck around for a while. People used to call me a \\u2018wigger.\\u2019 People used to say \\u2018wigger\\u2019 to me \\u2019cause they thought it would hurt my feelings. They thought, like, that was a way to get my goat. You know what I mean? And I\\u2019ll never forget. I was on a basketball court the first time I heard it, and we had won this basketball game, and this dude from the losing team says\\u2026 \\u2018Whatever, bro. That dude ain\\u2019t nothing but a wigger.\\u2019 And all my black friends heard it, and they were disappointed. They heard him say that, and they were like\\u2026 That\\u2019s how they sound, like a train. They were like\\u2026 When black guys are bummed out, it sounds like a train, just\\u2026 Next stop, Sedgwick. But they were bummed out \\u2019cause that was an attack, you know. They didn\\u2019t like that, but when I heard it, I heard it different, \\u2019cause they were like, \\u2018That white dude ain\\u2019t nothing but a wigger.\\u2019 And I heard it, and I was like, \\u2018Oh\\u2026 so close.\\u2019 How do I get that N? How do I get that N? These are Karl Kani jeans. This is a Perry Ellis shirt. Give it to me. I bought Timberland boots. Say it if you\\u2019re gonna say it, you racist motherfuckers. Say it. How do I get that, man? It was just me being real. That\\u2019s all that was. I wanted to be a black guy. I thought I was black. I thought I was a black guy. Even to this day, I still have a lot of black friends, and I got to tell you\\u2026 Every time I talk to my black guy friends, I\\u2019m always like, \\u2018Hey, man, don\\u2019t date white girls.\\u2019 Don\\u2019t date white girls. Not \\u2019cause I\\u2019m racist. I\\u2019m clearly not racist. I have black friends. I\\u2019m not a racist. I tell my black guy friends to not date white girls \\u2019cause I genuinely care about the future of sports. That\\u2019s it. We don\\u2019t need any placekickers and long snappers. We want dunk contests, right? How do you get a Heisman? You know what I mean? Not from Jerome and Cassie. Jerome and Jaquanda\\u2026 That\\u2019s how we\\u2019re gonna make a Heisman, two beautiful chocolate people making love under a beautiful chocolate rain shower while he\\u2019s got shoes on. We know the formula. We know the formula. Drake is the number-one dude in hip-hop. His name is Aubrey. Yeah! We let him get away with that. Drake\\u2019s name is Aubrey, and nobody said shit about it. Aubrey, number one in hip-hop. What\\u2019s his name, Aubrey? Got it. Okay, cool. We\\u2019re good. He had beef with Meek Mill. It was a big beef. You\\u2019re it. Tag, you\\u2019re it. You\\u2019re it. Tag. Remember real beef? You remember when hip-hop was, like, real beef? People hated each other. Tupac and Biggie hated each other so much, and they were best friends at one point. They had real beef so deep that Tupac started a song called \\u2018Hit \\u2018Em Up\\u2019\\u2026 Before he started the lyrics, he goes, \\u2018So I fucked your bitch, you fat motherfucker.\\u2019 That\\u2019s what he said. You\\u2019re fat. Fucked your girlfriend. Okay, let\\u2019s go. Here we go. That\\u2019s crazy. That\\u2019s how much he hated that guy. That\\u2019s real beef. I feel like hip-hop has, like, dissipated, you know. It\\u2019s just, like, gone by the wayside, and I blame one person for the death of hip-hop. His name is Macklemore. That dude is the worst. That dude is the worst. Macklemore is at fault for all this shit going south. Macklemore is not hip-hop. You can like him, but he\\u2019s not hip-hop, okay? That\\u2019s pop. He talks about going downtown on a scooter with his pals. Come on, bro. What? You\\u2019re gonna go downtown with your buddies on a scooter, Macklemore? That\\u2019s not hip-hop. Hip-hop doesn\\u2019t go downtown. Hip-hop lives downtown, and it goes to the suburbs and robs those people and comes back downtown. It doesn\\u2019t go downtown. Talking about thrift stores. Fuck you, bro. Don\\u2019t fucking talk about discount clothing! No! I don\\u2019t want to hear that, man. I want to hear a rapper be like\\u2026 And I\\u2019m like, \\u2018You got it, you got it.\\u2019 That\\u2019s what I want to hear, man. I want to hear Rick Ross be like\\u2026 That\\u2019s what I want to hear. Get out of here, Macklemore. What\\u2019s wrong with you, bro? This guy\\u2019s bullshit. We can\\u2019t call him hip-hop. It\\u2019s crazy that he\\u2019s hip-hop, \\u2019cause it\\u2019s not. It\\u2019s all some sensitive-ass shit. The thing that made me the most mad about Macklemore is he co-wrote this song he got a Grammy nomination for that arguably made him famous, right? It made him famous, right? It was called \\u2018Same Love.\\u2019 It was about same-sex marriage. Now, the song and the depth of the song I\\u2019m not against. I\\u2019m for same-sex marriage. I don\\u2019t give a shit who you want to marry, okay? You want to marry who you want to marry? Go crazy, man. You don\\u2019t fuck kids or animals, I don\\u2019t care. That\\u2019s it for me. No kids, no animals, we\\u2019re straight. You want to marry your toaster? Go crazy. Just don\\u2019t return that. I don\\u2019t want to buy that fucked toaster. So the song I\\u2019m okay with. It\\u2019s at the beginning of the song, the intro. He goes, \\u2018When I was in the third grade, I thought that I was gay.\\u2019 Remember this bullshit? I thought that I was gay. When I was in the third grade, I thought I was a gay person. That\\u2019s what he said. I thought I was one of you fellas. Thank God I\\u2019m not. I\\u2019m not, but I thought I was. I thought so. I hated that. I hated that \\u2019cause they applauded him. They were like, \\u2018Oh, how bold. \\u2018How brave of Macklemore. \\u2018He thought he was a homosexual. \\u2018In third grade, he thought he was a homosexual. \\u2018He\\u2019 s not, which is good, but he thought he was. He thought he was a gay.\\u2019 And they thought that was, like, a risky thing to say\\u2026 \\u2018I thought I was gay when I was in third grade.\\u2019 I hate that shit. You remember third grade? I do. Everybody was gay. Everybody in here in third grade was gay. You were all gay. I wore sweat pants. I played the recorder. I was very gay. I used to Rollerblade around my neighborhood, like, \\u2018Hey, fellas.\\u2019 I would fag out all day. Like\\u2026 I was homosexual, bro. It wasn\\u2019t a question. It was a fact. That kid\\u2019s gay as shit. Little redhead gay kid skating backwards. I was gay, man. I was gay when I was in third grade. You were all gay in third grade. I would beg my mom to let me sleep at other boys\\u2019 houses every night of the week. I want to sleep at Billy\\u2019s. What are you doing over there? None of your business, Mom! Make the call, please! I was so gay in third grade. If another boy accused me of liking girls, I\\u2019d fucking murder that kid. Chicago, Illinois, I got to go. I\\u2019m Andrew Santino. Thank you so much, man. Thank you, guys. I love you, Chicago. Everybody who\\u2019s anybody has lived in this building, man. Locals, baby\\u2026 Jordan, Pippen, Longley, Kerr, Paxton. You know it, dude. Ryne Sandberg used to own and live in one of those big white poles at the top. He would have to slide down for breakfast. Al Capone still lives in the basement. Not dead. It\\u2019s now called Willis, used to be called Macy\\u2019s Tower, after the Macy\\u2019s Thanksgiving Day Parade, because most of the floats are made right here in this building. It\\u2019s actually anatomically to scale\\u2026 even his balls. The penis is not. They ran out of clay, but the balls are full. And if you look right beyond me, that\\u2019s the Adams Street Bridge, named, of course, after the Addams Family. Duh-na-na-na. Oh, you want a fat dick in a bun or a little dick in a bun? I don\\u2019t want any penises on the hot dog, just a regular hot dog. Okay, we\\u2019re gonna give you a Trump dog, then. Gonna give me a Trump dog? Damn right. You know what? Let me tell you something. You\\u2019re not nice, and you\\u2019re not nice to people and\\u2026 We don\\u2019t give a fuck about your fucking soft ass. Yes. I\\u2019m sick of this abuse. All I want is\\u2026 Save that pussy-ass shit for somebody else that want to fucking hear it. Good night, pussy lips. Right. Fine, good night. Bye, dick cheese. Get the fuck out of here. I\\u2019m leaving. Pussy nose. Well, leave. Tweet, tweety bird. Hey, Andrew, I think the crew\\u2019s gonna head out of here. Cool, man. Get out. We\\u2019re wrapped. Yeah, I\\u2019m here. Do you need a ride, or are you good? I get in my\\u2026 I can walk. Okay. Cool. Good luck with your special or tour guide, whatever this is. Thanks, dude. Thank you, Bernard.

We\\u2019re taking on so many aspects of things that, uh\\u2026 people were hopelessly tied up in knots in Congress, but you\\u2019ll see, uh\\u2026 levels of detail, levels of thought\\u2026 I would love to see detail. \\u2026that a lot of people believed very strongly we didn\\u2019t have in this country. Uh, Mr. President, it looks like you\\u2019re golfing. Things that nobody has even contemplated, thought about, thought possible. We\\u2019re gonna get things done. [coughs] So when are you gonna start on this stuff? So, I think we\\u2019ll start sometime on Tuesday? [Sarah] Tuesday works. Then we\\u2019re going into the immigration, the world of immigration and education. Immigration, education. You did mention that before. We\\u2019re going into the world of healthcare. Oh! I\\u2019m gonna let you get back\\u2026 \\u2026a lot of exciting\\u2026 \\u2026to starting on those plans, Mr. President. Thank you so much for calling us again. A lot of us are working from home, but some of us are twerking from home. Here to show us how she does it, please welcome Megan Thee Stallion. Hi, Sarah Cooper! Good morning, Megan. Sarah! [static] Can you hear me? Megan? [Megan] Sarah? Megan\\u2026 Megan, can you hear me? Sarah! Megan? Megan? [chuckles] We\\u2019re gonna get a little update from Scooter in a second. We\\u2019ll sort this right out. We\\u2019ll just move on. Scooter, are you getting the Internet? It seems to be working fine right here. Plenty of Wi-Fi. Plenty. Oh, my goodness, the Internet, right? Wi-Fi is so weird. Yeah. Do we need a modem, Scooter? We need a modem, yeah\\u2026 [chuckling] [Sarah] It\\u2019s a cable joke. [laughing] Hoop-dee-hoo! Yeah. We\\u2019ll have to wait between 10:00 a.m. and 6:00 p.m. for them to come in. [laughing] So funny. We might not have any Internet access, but in good news, we have a woman whose baked goods have become a national sensation. Not just for how they taste, but for what they wear. Please welcome, all the way from Wedgecot, New Jersey, the creator of Cupcake Shoes, K.J. Dillard. [Scooter] Think you\\u2019re going the wrong way. There we go. [director] All right, go to camera two. Beautiful. [in sing-song voice] My pretty. Little bit of curly hair for you. [gasps] [softly] There we go. Welcome, K.J.! [gasps] Oh, my God, you startled me. [chuckles] I\\u2019m here to do the Sarah Cooper show. And we are so excited to have you. These might be the cutest cupcakes I\\u2019ve ever seen. They are my pride and joy. Now I\\u2019d appreciate it if you got Sarah for me. Thank you. I\\u2019m Sarah Cooper. I didn\\u2019t say \\u201cSierra,\\u201d honey. I said \\u201cSarah.\\u201d That is Sarah Cooper. I\\u2019m Sarah Cooper, the host of the show. You\\u2019re Sarah Cooper? Yep. Can I see some ID? Here is my license, passport, and my birth certificate. No, I need to see some kind of a permit that shows me that you\\u2019re allowed to be on the premises. Okay, K.J., why don\\u2019t you tell our viewers how you came up with this fabulous idea? Well, I used to design these dolls called \\u201clittle pooples\\u201d that you\\u2019d put on the end of your toilet, and then I got tired because I wasn\\u2019t able to eat \\u2019em. So, should I be sharing personal information with this person? It just\\u2026 It helps with banter. I love this little guy. What is his name? His name is Broadway Berry \\u2019cause he\\u2019s berry-flavored, and he\\u2019s very fragile. Well, I am ready to make one. [gasps and exclaims] [dialing] [operator] 9-1-1, what\\u2019s your emergency? This is Karen June Dillard. Karen! I am with a person and my gut tells me she is up to no good. Scooter. I can\\u2019t hear anything. Got my gloves on. [K.J.] Yes, she\\u2019s a female. And I would say at least 70% Africo-American. Yes. Now she\\u2019s destroying my property! This is my property. [gasps] [woman] Welcome to \\u201cKarens.\\u201d I\\u2019m Whoopi Goldberg. In 1876, a Boston Karen bemoaned to her husband how taxing it was for her to walk miles into town every time she wanted to get a Black person arrested. He vowed to resolve this issue. \\u201cWife,\\u201d he said, \\u201cI shall make it so that you may summon the police on Black people from the comfort of our very home.\\u201d His name was Alexander Graham Bell. [Karen Bell] They\\u2019re standing by my horse! [horse neighs] [Whoopi] But the role of Karens did not start with the invention of the telephone. The New World was crawling with Karens. Karen over here, Karen over there, Karens every-goddamn-where. [Karen] They\\u2019re on my property! [Whoopi] Some even claim that they can trace the roots of Karens as far back as the book of Genesis. [Karen] They\\u2019re eating that snake\\u2019s apple! [Whoopi] When we come back, my actual next-door neighbor, Karen. I\\u2019ve got a few choice words to say to this bitch. [man] Sore muscles, back pain, headaches and weakness. If you have COVID-19, getting a good night\\u2019s sleep can be rough. But starting now, your pesky pains are over. From the makers of MrPillow comes a brand-new product, the MrPillow Coronavirus Vaccine. Hi. I\\u2019m Steve Windell, the creator of MrPillow and MrPillowPlus. For 20 years, I\\u2019ve dedicated my life to making firm yet fluffy pillows that don\\u2019t break the bank. So, I thought, \\u201cWhy not take the magic of MrPillow and use it to make a vaccine for coronavirus?\\u201d So, how does it work? It\\u2019s pretty simple, actually. The MrPillow Vaccine is made from thousands of tiny microscopic pillows shrunken down to the size of the deadly virus. Once injected into the bloodstream, these individualized pillows insert themselves under the novel coronavirus and lull it into a restful slumber. The virus now defenseless, the body\\u2019s immune cells can go to work. That\\u2019s how we here at MrPillow put the science back in sleep science. I got my friendly MrPillow Vaccine in the mail, and three days later, I already feel immune to COVID and ready to mix and mingle. I\\u2019m even going to a pool party later. Thank you, MrPillow. And I had COVID for three weeks and then I got it again! Hey! I think I\\u2019ll load up on that vaccine right now. Nurse? I feel better already. Order the MrPillow Coronavirus Vaccine for just four easy payments of $99, or $12,000 with insurance. The MrPillow Coronavirus Vaccine works. [man] The MrPillow Coronavirus Vaccine may cause coronavirus. [whirring] [Trump\\u2019s voice] Anynomous\\u2026 really anomous. [speaking alien language] Thank you so much to our viewers for your patience. We got our technical difficulties all figured out and we are so excited to welcome \\u201cshe likes to hoist up her moist stuff,\\u201d Megan Thee Stallion. Hey, Sarah Cooper! Megan, it is so amazing to have you here. You are such a legend. I have a question. I\\u2019m sure it\\u2019s on the minds of all our viewers. How are you dealing with this whole \\u201cnew normal\\u201d thing? Listen, Sarah Cooper, I\\u2019m not going outside until coronavirus is a memory, okay? Like, you can go back in the textbook and be like, \\u201cDamn, y\\u2019all remember coronavirus? That shit was crazy, right?\\u201d [chuckles] Yeah. So until then, I\\u2019m staying my ass in the house. [narrator] Sarah had to make a pee-pee, but knew she had to play it cool for the folks at home. I have to say, that ass you\\u2019re staying in the house is very nice. How do you look so good all the time? Well, you know, I like to work out, gotta keep that ass tight, sharp. [chuckling] Real hot-girl shit. [Sarah] Yeah, real hot-girl stuff. Any tips you can give us for working out at home? Definitely. I actually have this great workout called \\u201cDrink your drink.\\u201d Drink your drink? Goes like this. Get your cup, and one\\u2026 and two. And\\u2026 [mimics drink flowing] Is that cognac? Yes, Sarah Cooper, yeah, it is. I been doing this every day for quarantine and let me tell you, I feel great. Well, you look great. Thanks. You, too, can look like this. All you gotta do is grab some cognac, add a little squat to it. Even a little lunge. Real easy, like\\u2026 Mmm. Like that? A little more sexy and a little less like you sitting on the toilet. Somebody get her some cognac. Scooter, can I get some cognac? [Scooter] Yes. Trying to do the six feet, so\\u2026 So, all you gotta do is dip and sip. [both] Dip and sip. Dip and sip. Yep, yep, yep. [sexy music playing] I think I\\u2019m doing it! I\\u2019ve never twerked before in my life. [laughs] It\\u2019s happening. No, try it like this. Try it a little more sexy. Okay. Pow, pow, pow. Little hair flip. Girl, live your life, do you, be a hot girl. Everybody wasn\\u2019t meant to be in the twerk Olympics, so just do you, be you. Be the best Sarah Cooper you can be. I can do that. This is a really great workout. I know! Real hot-girl shit. [Scooter] If you don\\u2019t mind, this is supposed to be six feet. We certainly are lubed up here at the Everything\\u2019s Fine studio. We\\u2019ll be right back. [Scooter] All right, we are out. Good job. [cork pops] This stuff is really strong. [theme song playing] It\\u2019s the 3:00 a.m. hour here on QAnon QAC. Just a note, this is the real QAnon, not the other one people were saying was the real QAnon on 4chan. Please stop doxing me. I\\u2019ve had to move five times. Let\\u2019s check in with our viewers. Emma from Philadelphia. [Emma] Hey, Ashley. How are you this morning? Longtime caller, always listening. You blinked your right eye just now when you said this was the real QAnon. Was that a sign that you have been contacted by the god of fire? [chuckles] Don\\u2019t be ridiculous, Emma. That was a nervous tic in my eye. It was not a coded message. Believe me, you will know when I\\u2019ve been contacted by the god of fire. Thanks, Ashley. [ominous music playing] [easy jazz music playing] This morning, we are proud to feature our Indoctrination Porcelain Doll Collection. They\\u2019re stunning dolls, and yes, we do accept cryptocurrency, but only QCoin. Let\\u2019s take a look at these dolls. How adorable. It\\u2019s presidential mouthpiece, Kellyanne. [Kellyanne\\u2019s voice] Don\\u2019t be so overly dramatic about it, Chuck. What it\\u2026 You\\u2019re saying it\\u2019s a falsehood, and they\\u2019re giving Sean Spicer, our press secretary, gave\\u2026 alternative facts to that, but the point\\u2026 Ugh. Never a dull moment. This one just talks and talks and talks and talks and talks. Order soon as this one has recently been discontinued. [gasps] Ah! My naan! Thank you, Quincy. I\\u2019m so sorry. I am just so starving and it is hard to get good Indian food in this undisclosed location. [sniffs] Ahh! Next caller. [man] Hey, Ashley. [laughing] Mike from Minnesota, how are you again? Did you just get naan from Quincy? Is that a code for QAnon? Right? QAnon, a sign that you\\u2019re Q? I am not Q, I am just on in the middle of the night selling porcelain dolls. Q is in Washington uncovering a cabal of sex predators. I appreciate you sending me messages through the TV. Next we have, \\u201cI am woman, hear me roar, but very softly so I still sound sexy.\\u201d [softly] Ivanka. This doll teaches our daughters that it\\u2019s better to be seen and not heard. [Ivanka\\u2019s voice] If being complicit is wanting to\\u2026 Is wanting to be a force for good and to make a positive impact, then I\\u2019m complicit. [thunder cracks] [yells in fear] Whoo! The storm is coming. I told you this was the real QAnon. Next caller! [distorted voice] How\\u2019s it going? Are you saying we can expect a storm when the president will reveal the mass execution of the Washington figures responsible for murdering a DNC staffer? I\\u2019d say keep your eyes open, and coming up in the 4:00 a.m. hour, we have a phenomenal weighted blanket that you\\u2019re not gonna\\u2013 Weighted blankets are a media tool invented by George Soros. Watch your back, Ashley. I always do, honey. I have to. Finally, we have the best first lady, Melania. Beautiful, stunning, and really, what else do you need? [Melania\\u2019s voice] I\\u2019m very involved in charities now, many charities involving children, involving many different diseases. Hi\\u2026 Melania. All of these dolls are available now by calling 666-666-6666\\u2026 666666\\u2026 This is not the real QAnon. Get out now! [Christmas bells jangling] [Sarah] The former QAnon host starts her new job at the White House this week. [breaking news alert plays] We have some breaking news coming in. It appears the president is live-tweeting this program right now, and we\\u2019ve noticed a ratings bump when we show what he\\u2019s saying about us in real time, so\\u2026 that\\u2019s what we\\u2019re gonna do. Okay, so the president is saying that everything is not fine. Uh, I guess we\\u2019ll have to see if we can change the name of the show. [Scooter] I\\u2019m open to it. \\u201cNow they\\u2019re playing my tweet. Stop playing my tweet. That\\u2019s my tweet.\\u201d The president now thinks \\u201cthe country is totally fine\\u201d and \\u201cit\\u2019s the best it\\u2019s ever been.\\u201d \\u201cBecause of me.\\u201d Who, me? \\u201cNo, me, the president.\\u201d \\u201cBest president ever.\\u201d Oh. [cheerfully] Best president ever! And the president now likes our show again and our ratings are\\u2026 up! Great. More on these tweets as they continue to suck the life out of our democracy. [buzzer sounds] [theme song playing] [Scooter] Great segment. [Sarah] Thank you! [narrator] Sarah wasn\\u2019t sure the segment had gone great. She wasn\\u2019t sure of much at all anymore. [heart beating] [Scooter] Uh, we\\u2019re ready for robot CEO. I\\u2019m Sarah Cooper. [echoes] I\\u2019m Sarah Cooper. We\\u2019ll be right back. [director] We\\u2019re out. Do you know what I miss? Shawarma. I miss eating shawarma in a really crowded restaurant in close proximity to other diners. Yeah. People sitting two feet away from you just shoveling food into their disgusting mouths. [man] I miss that human connection. [director] Oh, Sarah. Hi. Why did you want to meet with us? You called me in here. [man] Okay, smarty pants. Let\\u2019s look at your file and see how your ratings are doing. I forgot. I can\\u2019t read. All right. [clears throat] Looks like 35% of our audience likes that you\\u2019re Black, 30% of our audience doesn\\u2019t like that you\\u2019re Black, 50% of our audience doesn\\u2019t know you\\u2019re Black, but thankfully, 80% of our audience feels extremely threatened by you, Sarah. It\\u2019s that attitude of yours. I don\\u2019t think I have an attitude. [man] There it is. There it is. The boss didn\\u2019t hire you to be aggressive. The boss hired you to be a non-threatening Black woman like Tootie and Lisa Turtle, and that other one. Lovable, but forgettable. Well, I think it might be a little confusing, because I\\u2019m named Sarah, and I feel like when my parents named me Sarah, a white lady just moved into my body and gentrified my whole personality, you know? Like, my mom would cook jerk chicken\\u2013 I love jerk chicken. He does. He\\u2019s a jerk. He loves the chicken. I love it. And I\\u2019d be like, \\u201cOh, this is too spicy.\\u201d And she\\u2019d say, [in Jamaican accent] \\u201cThere are children around the world, all they get for dinner is bread and water.\\u201d And I\\u2019d be like, \\u201cThat actually sounds pretty good.\\u201d Like, a scone and a chai latte. Yes, a scone and chai tea latte would be perfect. Any time of the day. Um\\u2026 That would be really great \\u2019cause I was born in Jamaica, but moved here when I was three. Jamaica. I knew it. I actually watched these characters when I was little. I mean, Tootie and Lisa and Hilary and\\u2026 and\\u2026 Um\\u2026 And that other one. I mean, these characters inspired me, you know? I feel like they ran so that I could sing. But you can\\u2019t sing, which is why you\\u2019re on the morning show and not on Broadway. Okay, I will tone it down. [director] Yeah. Stick to the news. All right? Leave politics out of it. Got it. Thank you. [man] Better go. Yeah. Marv, do you think I should buy another gun? Lorraine, what are you talking about? Are you crazy? Of course you should buy another gun. Thank you. We live in very dangerous times. You\\u2019re right. [Scooter] Hey, pals. How\\u2019s it going? Hi! Scooter. Hey, Scooter. What\\u2019s going on here? [Scooter] This is to keep things safe, six-foot distance. Smart. He\\u2019s so smart. [Scooter] Well, as you were. See you later. [Lorraine] Thank you. [Marvin chuckles] Get the door on your way out? [Scooter] Sure. I can\\u2019t touch the doorknob. Can you just shut the door, please? [Scooter] It\\u2019s not me, it\\u2019s the door. [Lorraine] Gotta get some work done. If you could\\u2013 Close the door! [Scooter] This has to get fixed. This is Connie Chung with the president this morning. Mr. President, what is your plan to unite the country? [Trump\\u2019s voice] I\\u2019m not a big fan of sharks either. I don\\u2019t know how many votes I\\u2019m gonna lose. I have people calling me up, \\u201cSir, we have a fund to save the shark, it\\u2019s called \\u2018Save the Shark.'\\u201d I say, \\u201cNo, thank you.\\u201d Oh, no. Mr. President, I was asking you about uniting the country. I think I am actually humble. I\\u2019m much more humble than you would understand. [mutters] Mr. President, I asked you about\\u2013 Excuse me. Stop and frisk. Okay? Stop and frisk. All right\\u2026 Excuse me. You take guns away. Rudy Giuliani was a great mayor. He did it in New York. He started it and it worked great. I\\u2019m sorry? Excuse me. You have people coming over with bags of soup, big bags of soup, and they lay it on the ground and the anarchists take it and they start throwing it at our cops. Bags of soup, big bags of soup. If it hits you, it\\u2019s worse than a brick \\u2019cause it\\u2019s got force. So, that was my interview with the president. Hi, I\\u2019m Steve Windell, and you\\u2019re gonna love my new line of MrPillow feminine hygiene products. Because your vagina deserves a tampon as soft and absorbant as one of my pillows. Try our down-feather version, too! [woman] In these uncertain times, we turn to familiar faces. And since 1975, we\\u2019ve been there for you\\u2026 Twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week. We had to go away for a while, but we knew it wouldn\\u2019t be long. Orgies. We\\u2019re back! [crowd cheering] Now with curbside pickup. [lullaby playing] [Trump\\u2019s voice] Thighland! Thighland! The super-duper missile. Mmm! Did you make this coffee, Scooter? I did not. [buzzer sounds] [theme song playing] [Sarah] Welcome back to Everything\\u2019s Fine. Big story this morning. As we\\u2019ve previously reported, a huge shake-up in the CEO world happened last Friday when we learned the CEO of Techtech Corp is actually a robot. Strangely, no one even noticed for several months. Live in studio via Camrojex technology, please welcome 8008s. Thanks, Sarah. It\\u2019s great to be here. [Sarah] Thank you for taking time out of your busy schedule. Well, I can multitask better than my human counterparts, Sarah. For example, right now, I\\u2019m chatting with you, doing Joe Rogan\\u2019s podcast, and kicking off a workplace diversity program all at the same time. Okay, so is it safe to assume you\\u2019re programmed to simply do everything your predecessors did? Unlike Elon Musk, I have a human side. [Scooter chuckles] Elon Musk. I was made by a great group of guys who really take social change seriously. For example, I\\u2019m programmed with the complete knowledge of feminist content such as Sex and the City, Cosmo and \\u201cHot Girl Summer.\\u201d I\\u2019m not sure I\\u2019d consider that feminist\\u2013 I\\u2019ve also learned about the Black experience in America by watching all three Barbershop movies, and the Beauty Shop spin-off. Okay, again, I\\u2019m not sure we\\u2013 I\\u2019m sorry. I\\u2019m being told that I\\u2019m getting off track. As president and CEO, my number-one job is to make my shareholders happy. But that\\u2019s kind of been the problem, hasn\\u2019t it? Big businesses just focusing on money, making myopic business moves that leave the whole country with more disparity and\\u2026 How are you doing that? Camrojex technology. Oh, wow. Just relax. This is really inappropriate. But technically, you\\u2019re a robot and I haven\\u2019t had a massage in months. [sensual song playing] That feels incredible. [sighs] Hold on, we have some breaking news. It\\u2019s been reported that Robot CEO 8008s has been fired by its board of directors after making unwanted advances toward an office printer. That printer knew exactly what it was doing. It was always asking me to make a copy. Because that\\u2019s its job. And it\\u2019s not just a printer, it has a name. HP Printer/Scanner/Copier 500s, whose side of the story I\\u2019m sure we all want to hear. Scooter, can we get HP Printer/Scanner/Copier 500s on the cloud system? Thank you so much for joining us, HP Printer/Scanner/Copier 500s. Tell us what happened. [beeping] Okay, wait, wait. I\\u2019ll, uh\\u2026 I\\u2019ll make a public statement. Okay? Just give me two seconds to think. After eight months of careful soul-searching, I\\u2019ve decided to address the hideous allegations against me. I have not, nor have I ever mistreated or abused a printer/scanner/copier. I value printers. My printer\\u2026 is a printer. HP Printer/Scanner/Copier 500s, is there anything you want to say? [whirring and beeping] Sounds like we\\u2019re getting a fax. [fax machine printing] \\u201cF*ck you, 8008s.\\u201d I will now step away to spend time with my family. [theme music playing] Wow. AI has come so far. [Scooter] Three, two, one. We\\u2019re out. Can\\u2019t believe he\\u2019s a robot. Ladies and gentlemen, please give a big Allstate Arena parking lot welcome to Sarah Evak. [car horn honking] Thank you all so much. Hi, my name is Sarah Evak and I\\u2019m a close-up card magician. Uh, I\\u2019ve been doing this for, I don\\u2019t know, ten years. I\\u2019ve been everywhere. Singapore, you name it. Tonight\\u2019s show is at the Allstate Arena in Rosemont. Pretty exciting for me. [chuckles] I\\u2019m going to begin by introducing you to my family. I call them my family because some I see often and others when I least expect them. Can everyone see these? I\\u2019m going to shuffle these cards and you tell me when to stop. [horn honking] [Sarah] Okay, I haven\\u2019t started shuffling yet. [horn toots] Now I\\u2019m shuffling. [horns honking] Got it. Now I\\u2019m going to show you all this card. Can everyone see this card? [horns honking] Does anyone work here? [horns honking] Can you take this card and show it? Yeah. Don\\u2019t show it to me. Oh, okay. During COVID, I\\u2019m also a teacher in a Zoom Room. But this\\u2026 This is where I come alive. Beep when you\\u2019ve seen it. And\\u2013 [horn beeps] [horn beeps] [man] I\\u2019ve never worked with a magician. I was a Frankenstein at a haunted house once, though. So, you know, I\\u2019m used to being around performers. Is this your card? I had to get out of that racket \\u2019cause of the Illuminati. You know, they want to get you. [horn beeps] It\\u2019s like, not for me. Nope, I\\u2019ll stick to parking lot attendant. That\\u2019s the life for me. Simple. [car horns blaring] I think it went okay. Yeah. I might have to buy giant cards for shows like these in the future. Um\\u2026 I don\\u2019t know. There\\u2019s a lot of beeping. So, when is this gonna be on? I just wanna make sure that I catch it. [man] Uh, sometime next year. Okay. Do you want to see another trick? No? Okay. [woman] We followed the guidelines. We reopened when it was safe. But now, it\\u2019s not safe again. [crowd] Aw! [man 1] Honestly? [woman] Orgies. Maybe later. [man 2] Damn it. Wonderful place. Wonderful. Oh, my goodness. Unbelievable. Oh, hello. My name is Natalie, and this is my husband, John. Hi, there. [chuckles] Welcome to Mar-a-Lago. We love it here. It is beautiful. You hear me? Oh, it\\u2019s gorgeous. I know what you\\u2019re thinking. \\u201cDo they allow Black people at Mar-a-Lago?\\u201d Um, we\\u2019re here! Right? Laugh it off. We are Black-ish, though. Last time we checked. Last time we checked, we were. Yes. And we\\u2019ve actually met the president. He saw us\\u2026 Yes, we did. \\u2026and he said that we are his two favorite Black people. And he says it every single time. Every time. Mmm-hmm. Such a charismatic personality he has. He\\u2019s such a celebrity. We actually got married here. Um, not in the big ballroom, but on the property. So it was still beautiful. Yes. Yeah. We\\u2019re not allowed in there right now. We\\u2019re not allowed in there yet, but there is a small room off to the side with a private entrance, very exclusive. [laughs] And they said we can go in there whenever we want. We can stay in there if we want to. Anytime. And then, one night, we actually got locked in there. And let\\u2019s just say it was very fortuitous. Yes, it got kind of hot in there. [ominous music playing] We just love it here. Just surrounded by all our friends. Surrounded by all of our friends, which is the most important part. We got you in our hearts. Right on. [Sarah] If you like skateboarding dogs, you\\u2019re gonna wanna stick around after Everything\\u2019s Fine for Thinking Outside the Bachs with Jordana Bachman. [Jordana] I don\\u2019t know what this is about to be, but okay! [Sarah] Coming up at the twelve o\\u2019clock hour. Let\\u2019s do the weather segment. Love the weather. Love the weather! [Lorraine] Mmm. [theme song playing] Okay, weather segment in three, two\\u2026 And now, let\\u2019s check in on how the sky\\u2019s doing today with our meteorologist, Andrea Steele. Thanks, Sarah. Well, we\\u2019re looking at some real clear skies today, up to 75 degrees. Absolutely beautiful out. Let\\u2019s look ahead at the five-day forecast. Tuesday, we\\u2019re gonna see a bit of rain, but break out that summer gear as temperatures shoot up to a whopping 103 degrees. Wednesday, out of nowhere, there\\u2019s gonna be a ferocious hailstorm with sustained winds up to 75-plus miles per hour. Scooter, you may wanna board up your windows. My windows are always boarded up. You know that weird house in your neighborhood that\\u2019s got all the boards up in the windows, and everyone thinks, \\u201cIs that an abandoned hospital?\\u201d That\\u2019s my place. Excellent. Thursday, you might wanna break out the sunscreen again, because it\\u2019s gonna be a hot one. 123 degrees with a humidity index so high, a friend of mine who works at the EPA called me crying. He\\u2019s a grown man. Friday, we shoot down to negative 12 degrees with a windchill index we weren\\u2019t even able to calculate using a Doppler 8000 technology. It\\u2019s gonna be a cold one, folks. Most likely not survivable, so wear a jacket. And Saturday, temperatures radically return to breezy 75 degrees. However, that isn\\u2019t just a cute graphic we made up. We\\u2019re actually projecting literal flaming snowmen to be walking the streets with some possible fire tornado watches in effect. Everything\\u2019s fine with the weather. I\\u2019m Andrea Steele. Back to you, Sarah. Andrea, I\\u2019m sorry, but that forecast is\\u2013 Insane? Uh, yeah. You think? I mean, I\\u2019ve been doing the weather for 17 years, Sarah, and I have never seen anything like this in my entire lifetime. You think I like telling people they\\u2019re gonna die, or their skin might peel off if they run to the grocery store? No one should be going outside unless they absolutely have to. [heart beating] Scooter? [narrator] Everything was not fine. [exhales deeply] Scooter, are you asleep? [narrator] Had the world gone mad? Andrea, are you okay? [scoffs] Am I okay? This b!tch. Am I okay? Um\\u2026 No, actually, \\u2019cause we got a bat disease just floating around in the sky, there\\u2019s a new natural disaster every motherf*cking day, factories destroying the environment. Look at this damn forecast behind me. This is the first time I\\u2019ve left my house in months! All it takes is one wrong motherf*cker to breathe on me funny, and I swear to God\\u2026 Scooter, are we still on a nine-second delay? The woman who presses that button stopped coming in weeks ago. Well, in that case, let me just say this. F*ck, sh!tty, doo-doo, b!tch, and stay the f*ck in your house. Reporting live from hell on earth, this is Andrea motherf*cking Steele. Back to you, Sarah. That was great. We\\u2019ll be right back. [buzzer sounds] Great. We\\u2019re out. Nice. Wow. So that\\u2019s your house I walk by every day. [Scooter] Yeah. Ah. My kids are terrified to go past there. [chuckling] That\\u2019s the one. It doesn\\u2019t look like anyone\\u2019s lived there in hundreds of years. [Scooter] That\\u2019s my place. [Andrea] Interesting. Well, it\\u2019s safe. It\\u2019s spooky. [Scooter] Yeah. It\\u2019s awful there. Everybody ready? Here we go. Five, four, three, two, one. Welcome back to Everything\\u2019s Fine. I\\u2019m Sarah Cooper. And now for our top story, an exclusive look inside that now-famous Access Hollywood bus. [man\\u2019s voice] She used to be great. Still beautiful. [Trump\\u2019s voice] I moved on her. She was down in Palm Beach. I moved on her and I failed, I\\u2019ll admit it. Whoa. I did try and fuck her. She was married. That\\u2019s huge news there. [Trump\\u2019s voice] No, Nancy\\u2026 This was\\u2026 And I moved on her very heavily. In fact, I took her out furniture shopping. She wanted to get some furniture. I said, \\u201cI\\u2019ll show you where they have some nice furniture.\\u201d Took her out furniture\\u2013 I moved on her like a b!tch. But I couldn\\u2019t get there, and she was married. All of a sudden I see her, she\\u2019s now got the big phony tits and everything. She\\u2019s changed her look. Sheesh, your girl\\u2019s hot as shit. In the purple. [all] Whoa! [Billy Bush\\u2019s voice] Yes! Yes! The Donald has scored! [all laughing] Oh, my man! Wait, you gotta look at me when you\\u2026 [indistinct chatter] Thumbs up. [Trump\\u2019s voice] You\\u2019re a pussy. You gotta put the thumbs up. Gotta get the thumbs up. You can\\u2019t be too happy. [man 1] Let me\\u2026 [man 2] That\\u2019s funny. You and I will walk out. Oh, my God. [indistinct chatter] Maybe it\\u2019s a different one. Better not be the publicist. No, it\\u2019s her. [Trump\\u2019s voice] Yeah, that\\u2019s her. With the gold. I gotta use some Tic Tacs, just in case I start kissing her. I\\u2019m automatically attracted to beautiful\\u2026 I just start kissing them. It\\u2019s like a magnet, I just kiss. [laughing] I don\\u2019t even wait. And when you\\u2019re a star, they let you do it. Just kiss. Just\\u2026 You can do anything. Whatever you want. Grab \\u2019em by the p*ssy. I can do anything. I can do anything. Those legs, all I can see is the legs. Oh, it looks good. Come on, shorty. Ooh, nice legs, huh? Oof. Get out of the way, honey. That\\u2019s good legs. Go ahead. It\\u2019s always good if you don\\u2019t fall out of the bus. Like Ford, Gerald Ford, remember? [Bush\\u2019s voice] Down below. Pull the handle. Hello. How are you? Hi. [Zucker\\u2019s voice] How are you? [Trump\\u2019s voice] Terrific. Pleasure to meet you. You know Billy Bush? Hello, nice to see you. How you doing, Arianne? I\\u2019m doing well, thank you. Ready to be a soap star? We\\u2019re ready. Make me a soap star. How about a hug for the Donald? He just got off the bus. Want a little hug? [Trump\\u2019s voice] Absolutely. Melania said this was okay. Hug for the Bushy? I just got off the bus. Oh! Bushy. [Bush\\u2019s voice] Here we go. Excellent. Excellent. Excellent. You\\u2019ve got a nice costar here. Yes. Absolutely. [Trump\\u2019s voice] After you. [heart beating] Great. We\\u2019re out. Nice. Scooter, what is happening? [both laughing] [Lorraine] This job is made for you, Marvin. Yeah, it keeps me out of trouble, as they say. Everything\\u2019s fine. Three, two, one, and we\\u2019re in. Sarah. And now, a little preview of what\\u2019s coming on after Everything\\u2019s Fine. We\\u2019ll have Jordana Bachman of Thinking Outside the Bachs, followed by Sandy Manderson, Miyoko Loco, and then, Andre Cole Watkins of Watkins the News. Stick around, it\\u2019s gonna be a great day. Isn\\u2019t it, Scooter? Miyoko Loco. [chuckles] A little help here. Save me. How about Sandy Manderson? Her face froze? Help. Tomorrow, something bad happens to your favorite celebrity. We\\u2019ll have a full report. Now, it\\u2019s over to Jordana Bachman for Thinking Outside the Bachs. Jordana, how are you doing? I\\u2019m doing good, girl. How are you, sister-friend? I\\u2019m doing so good. What do you got going on on the show today? Oh, well, let me tell you. A little bit of this, a little bit of that. Who knows? It\\u2019s the news. Who cares? You know, Jordana, I just realized we don\\u2019t have to do this anymore. You have to tell me. Do what? Do what? [laughing] This whole BFF handoff like we\\u2019re friends, laughing like we care about each other. We don\\u2019t care about each other. [Jordana] That, girl, is good news, because everyone can see through the bullsh!t! I don\\u2019t even know where you live. I don\\u2019t even see you except in this TV screen. That\\u2019s how I feel, just seeing you through a little box. What have you been up to? Girl, I\\u2019ve been up to so much. I\\u2019ve locked up every Black man in my life. I put my dad in a closet, my brother in a closet, my uncle in a closet, to make sure they live another day. Wow. Where do you put your clothes? [laughing] Oh, my God. What are we doing? Scooter. I\\u2019m sorry? And now, it is over to you, Jordana Bachman. Oh, no, girl, I couldn\\u2019t. I couldn\\u2019t. I have to pass it back to you, Sarah Cooper. You\\u2019re so funny. Back to you.

[heart beating] The last thing I remember was election night, and I started hyperventilating. I choked on my Invisalign, and then I guess I passed out under here. It\\u2019s kinda weird nobody noticed. Yeah. I found this work environment to be pretty toxic. What did I miss? I want to know everything. Would you mind massaging my legs?

[Marvin] Oh! [Lorraine] Marvin, you\\u2019re crazy. [Marvin] Yes, I am. [both laugh] [Lorraine] But what if we slot the Iranian assassination in 2024? [Marvin] No, no, no. I would do it sooner because we want relations with Iran to go as poorly as possible. Put it in 2021. [Lorraine] Okay. Yes. What if we shave two tons off the Greenland ice sheet? Yeah, yeah, yeah. 2028 or 2022? 2027. And let\\u2019s do something with bugs. I don\\u2019t know. Hornets! Who love to murder. [upbeat music playing] [both] Murder hornets! Oh! Yeah, yeah, yeah. And China seizes Hong Kong, 2028. And that pairs very nicely with the US gassing its own citizens. [giggles] Floods, 2026. What if Tom Hanks gets sick? Do it! He\\u2019s due! Kill off Mr. Peanut? Cancel Coachella. I hate those bands. Eating bats? I\\u2026 No, that\\u2019s too much. Let\\u2019s set Australia on fire! Turn the sky red! [distorted voice] Do it all in 2020. Really, boss?

[speaking backwards] [Whoopi\\u2019s voice] What you gonna do, Satan? You know, we\\u2019ve tangled before. And you know what happened. It\\u2019s Whoopi Goldberg talking to you now. What you gonna do? [in normal voice] Oh, my God. I don\\u2019t know where that came from. [narrator] At this moment, Sarah Cooper realized it wasn\\u2019t she who had lost her mind, it was the world. Scooter, help me out. Um\\u2026 You should just take the afternoon off. I just went scuba diving. I love scuba diving. You scuba dive? Love it. Maybe we should give her a raise. A raise would be great. [both laughing] I\\u2019m not gonna get a raise. I am a woman, so that does make more sense. Take all the time you need, Sarah. [in distorted voice] Never running out of news down here. Great. Okay. Well, I will just see you a little later.

Number one, I need you to treat women with respect always. Even if you think you\\u2019re right, be respectful. Number two, don\\u2019t mix white and dark liquor. That\\u2019s how you end up in the back of a police car. Speaking of which, get you a white friend. Black men with white friends are 38% less likely to be shot by the police. Are you listening?

I\\u2019m just saying, the flag had a couple upsides. Let\\u2019s just be real about it. I ain\\u2019t saying keep it around, but I grew up in the South. I can\\u2019t tell you how many times the Confederate flag came in handy. You stopping for gas at a strange place at 2:00 in the morning, you see that flag hanging from the window, you know this is not the place to get gas. And you keep it moving. What\\u2019s the rush to get rid of the flag? Especially if you white. If you white, you should want to keep the flag for a little while longer so at least black folks will know you cool. \\u2018Cause if you white and you not an asshole, that\\u2019s the one thing that helps us identify you. You get rid of that flag, we\\u2019ll be\\u2013 Mm-mmm. We got to figure out a way to know who the cool white people\\u2013 Cool white people, we just got to start giving y\\u2019all wristbands or handstamps.

It\\u2019s good to\\u2026 [cheers and applause] Birmingham in here. Yeah, yeah, Birmingham in here. I love the South, man. You know, South, we got some tension. We got our issues, you know. I talked to my uncle about it. You know, my uncle. \\u201cFirst thing we need to do is get rid of the N-word.\\u201d My uncle don\\u2019t like the N-word, my Uncle Derek. Hate the N-word, be trying to\\u2013 My uncle trying to quit the N-word the way people try to quit cigarettes, a little bit at a time. It\\u2019s a word. Ain\\u2019t no cravings. Either you say it or you don\\u2019t. My uncle be calling me every week with updates. \\u201cI only said it four times this week. \\u201cMm-hmm. \\u201cOnly said that four times. \\u201cNow, Sunday\\u2019s my cheat day, \\u2019cause I watch football. \\u201cI got to say it. I got to say it on Sunday. \\u201cGrown man drop a first down, I got to call him the N-word. That\\u2019s just what it is.\\u201d And this is my thing with the N-word, like\\u2013 Like, at this point, black folks, like, if we trying to get stuff done politically in this country\\u2013 We inching, we doing, we inching, we inching, but at this point, I think it\\u2019s time for us to schedule a meeting with gay people, \\u2019cause gay people get way more shit done than us. [applause] They don\\u2019t mess around. Gay people shut shit down. They want something to go away, it\\u2019s gone. They don\\u2019t fool around, man. Every week, it\\u2019s five, six new words you can\\u2019t call gay people. Black folks, we\\u2019ve been working on the N-word since 1804. We can\\u2019t get one word out the American vocabulary. Gay people up to 37 words. We need to go to Panera and have a meeting with gay people, and have a soup and salad and figure this out. Yeah, that\\u2019s how you figure out your issues, over soup and salad. You can\\u2019t even say \\u201cgay\\u201d no more. That\\u2019s how good gay people are. The only word left to address gay people by. You better not fumble that word in a sentence. That\\u2019s your ass. You use \\u201cgay\\u201d in the wrong context at work and see if you don\\u2019t have to go talk to Sylvia in HR. HR be on your ass immediately \\u2019cause you mumbled \\u201cgay\\u201d one time the wrong way. You was by yourself when you said the shit and you still got in trouble. It\\u2019s not like you was walking through the cubicles telling gay jokes, you was\\u2026 You was in the break room, you was alone, and your chips got stuck and you cussed. That don\\u2019t mean you a bad person, you was just hungry. You say anything when you\\u2019re hungry. Every man in this room, we\\u2019ve all been through it. Them chips get stuck at the top of the machine, and you try to jostle the machine a little bit. Them chips don\\u2019t fall, ain\\u2019t nobody got change for a dollar, so you can buy two packs, so you gotta shake\\u2026 \\u201cGive me the chips, you gay-ass machine!\\u201d \\u201cSylvia, line two. Sylvia, line two. Security to the break room, security to the break room.\\u201d And that\\u2019s it and you gone \\u2019cause you called some chips gay. But that\\u2019s the power of the gay agenda. They figured out a way to influence the political process of this country to make sure that their issues are at least heard. Even if people don\\u2019t get the bills passed, they at least listen to \\u2019em, and that\\u2019s what I\\u2019m trying to tell my uncle. You don\\u2019t like the N-word, man, you wanna get rid of the N-word, this all you gotta do. Start calling gay people n i g g a s. [laughter and applause] It\\u2019ll be gone tomorrow. Listen, I don\\u2019t like it either, all right, but that\\u2019s the best idea I got right now, okay? At least that\\u2019s what I\\u2019m gonna teach my son. I\\u2019m a father figure. I got to show him the right way. They try to divide us on television, you know. But there\\u2019s a lot of people that aren\\u2019t black that\\u2019s standing on the right side of issues that affect us. I appreciate those folks, you know. [applause] They don\\u2019t get highlighted enough. There\\u2019s plenty of people out there that care about black stuff. I done seen \\u2019em, man. I went to\\u2013 I went to a black history museum, I had a white tour guide. Hey, it threw me off for a second. I turned to the brother that was on the tour with me, I was like, \\u201cIs this the dude? He\\u2019s gonna do it?\\u201d It was a white dude, it was a white dude telling me about my shit. And he was good! Yeah, I was trying to hate on him. By the end of the tour, I was like, \\u201cYo, bro, you did your thing, man. \\u201cStraight up, fam, you do what you do. \\u201cHey, real quick, let me give you \\u201cone of these wristbands real quick. \\u201cYeah, put that on. In case it go down, you want to wear that wristband.\\u201d I know some folks got a problem with that. You don\\u2019t want a white person at a black history museum, I understand that. Here\\u2019s the thing. I\\u2019m not saying they\\u2019re better than a black tour guide. I think a black tour guide at a civil rights museum, I think they\\u2019re better equipped to speak on the experience, because they might\\u2019ve lived that life, they can speak to certain exhibits from a perspective that nobody else can. I just think if you go to a black history museum and you got a black tour guide, you need to go in the morning while he\\u2019s still in a good mood. \\u2018Cause that brother is stressed. You can\\u2019t walk around slavery all day for eight hours and not cuss at somebody. [cheers and applause] Somebody getting cussed. You gotta catch him at 9:00 a.m. He just finished that McGriddle. \\u201cHow y\\u2019all doing? \\u201cMy name is Charles, it\\u2019s my pleasure \\u201cto take you on this journey. \\u201cLook at these exhibits right here. \\u201cBlack history is American history. Come look at the exhibits.\\u201d You think that brother gonna be in a good mood at 4:30, he been staring at slavery? That dude liable to cuss out everybody. \\u201cLook at this shit! \\u201cCome look what you done to us! \\u201cCome look what you done to us! \\u201cLook what you\\u2013 Get your ass out my museum, motherfucker!\\u201d You go to the gift shop, it\\u2019s just people crying. That\\u2019s horrible. That\\u2019s scary. Something\\u2019s wrong, man. Just don\\u2019t be one of these people that\\u2019s surprised that black folks got issues. Them the people I can\\u2019t deal with. I\\u2019d rather talk to somebody that don\\u2019t agree with me than somebody that\\u2019s had they eyes closed. \\u201cHey, did you know black people\\u2013 Why are black people angry?\\u201d Motherfucker, we been angry. This ain\\u2019t new. You think this just happened last couple of years? Black folks been trying to tell y\\u2019all forever that they had some issues and we sat\\u2013 We invented the blues! [laughter and applause] What more of a sign did you need? We literally invented an entire genre of music based on sadness, that\\u2019s how sad we were. And we\\u2013 the blues was created here. That is an American art form. That is not native African\\u2013 Go listen to old African music. The shit is happy \\u2019cause we was free. [cheers and applause] Go back. Every old African song. \\u266a We have freedom in Africa \\u266a\\n\\u266a Freedom in Africa \\u266a\\n\\u266a Freedom, got freedom in Africa \\u266a Soon as we got off the slave ship. [imitating blues guitar] [imitating harmonica] We\\u2019ve been sad. How the hell are you surprised? \\u201cYeah, but, they\\u2019re not patriotic. \\u201cBlack people don\\u2019t like the national anthem anymore. What is\\u2026\\u201d That ain\\u2019t no shock to you, man. You wanna know what black folks feeling? Just listen to their music. Our music tell you everything that\\u2019s going on in the black psyche. It\\u2019s a beautiful\\u2026 telegram. [applause] And nowhere in the history of black music is there a hit patriotic song. That ain\\u2019t what we do. I mean, we\\u2019ll cover a song, but, like, we don\\u2019t write no original patriotic songs. Black artists ain\\u2019t never\\u2013 \\u2018Cause we got a conflicted relationship with the country. You can\\u2019t write no honest patriotic song. You gotta leave that to white artists. They done had a good time. You had a good time in America, you damn right you should be writing a patriotic\\u2013 \\u266a And I\\u2019m proud to be an American \\u266a\\n\\u266a Where at least I know I\\u2019m free \\u266a [cheers and laughter] They be serious. You couldn\\u2019t possibly expect that level of patriotism from a race of people that have had so many issues, you can\\u2019t. It\\u2019s not realistic. Black people don\\u2019t\\u2013 We don\\u2019t sing about America. We sing about specific cities where you can have a good-ass time. That\\u2019s what we do. We don\\u2019t talk about the country. We can tell you where the party at, though. We can do that. Look, I can\\u2019t tell you nothing about America, but let me tell you about the city where the heat is on all night on the beach \\u2019til the early morn. Welcome to Miami, that\\u2019s where you got to go. You ever been to California? Oh, my God, boy, you got to go down to California, boy. Boy, California knows how to party. The city of L.A., the city of good ol\\u2019 Watts and the city of Compton. They keep it rockin\\u2019. Write that shit down, I\\u2019m trying to tell you. They keep it rockin\\u2019. Black people don\\u2019t do patriotism. Maybe \\u201cGeorgia on My Mind.\\u201d That\\u2019s the closest we probably come. Maybe that, maybe that. That\\u2019s a good song, it\\u2019s warm, it\\u2019s about the country. Ray Charles, \\u201cGeorgia on My Mind,\\u201d good song. But\\u2026 the key word in that song is \\u201con my mind.\\u201d Ray Charles was just thinking about Georgia. He didn\\u2019t tell you to go there. Georgia\\u2019s like every other part of the South. It\\u2019s got some pockets you should not be in after dark. If you\\u2019d have asked Ray Charles to be more specific on where in Georgia to go, he\\u2019d have said to go to Atlanta where the players play and they ride in them thangs like every day. [cheers and applause] [chuckles] My Uncle Derek tried to shut me down on that one. \\u201cWhat about James Brown \\u2018Livin\\u2019 in America\\u2019? \\u201cThat\\u2019s patriotic, James Brown singing about America. It\\u2019s original and he black.\\u201d \\u266a Livin\\u2019 in America \\u266a\\n\\u266a Eye to eye \\u266a\\n\\u266a Livin\\u2019 in\\u2026 \\u266a It\\u2019s a good song, but keep it real, man. James Brown wrote that song for Rocky IV, and as soon as he finished singing it, Apollo Creed died in the ring. It\\u2019s a sad song. It\\u2019s a sad song. How can you hear \\u201cLivin\\u2019 in America\\u201d\\u2018 and not think about Apollo Creed just falling lifeless to the\\u2013 Michael B. Jordan lost his daddy that day. If anything, \\u201cLivin\\u2019 in America\\u201d is not patriotic. It\\u2019s the opposite. It\\u2019s a secret message to black people. James Brown is one of the most masterful musicians to ever walk this earth, dude. It\\u2019s a brilliant song. [cheers and applause] That song ain\\u2019t got nothing to do with America. That entire song, \\u201cLivin\\u2019 in America\\u201d is a secret message to black folks. All you gotta do, listen to the end of the song. Very end of \\u201cLivin\\u2019 in America,\\u201d all James Brown do is just start naming cities. That\\u2019s it, end of the song. \\u266a Livin\\u2019 in America \\u266a\\n\\u266a New Orleans, Detroit City \\u266a\\n\\u266a Dallas, Pittsburgh \\u266a\\n\\u266a Kansas City, Atlanta \\u266a He just naming safe places for black folks. That\\u2019s\\u2013 that\\u2019s it. Love black music, man. Hits you, you know. That\\u2019s why I have\\u2013 That\\u2019s why I have a hard time going to see civil rights movies. I have to go see civil right movies in the middle of the day so nobody can see me crying. \\u2018Cause them movies be hitting you, man. Civil rights movies get me with that Negro humming. Oh, my God, I break down. \\u2018Cause you know, every civil rights movie just got that scene where it\\u2019s just some humming. \\u266a Freedom \\u266a [humming] You tell me that don\\u2019t break you down, in the middle of a civil rights movie, just that humming? There don\\u2019t even be nothing serious happening on screen, I be crying. It\\u2019s just a dude putting butter on a waffle, and just\\u2026 [humming] \\u266a Freedom \\u266a [humming continues] You be in the theater bawling. \\u201cHe was just putting butter on the waffle! They wouldn\\u2019t let him, they wouldn\\u2019t let him.\\u201d Civil rights movies get me all the time, man. They get me with that humming, and then they always make black people fall in slow motion. Yo, every civil rights movie, a black person fall in slow\\u2013 Why you got to slow down my pain? Just play it at regular speed. Any time a black person falls in a civil rights movie, they fall, then they do that double bounce in the dirt and the dirt come up. \\u201cGet out of here, darkie! Just get out!\\u201d \\u201cOhhh!\\u201d Pfft! Pfft! [cheers and applause] Don\\u2019t do that to me. Most powerful civil rights movie scene of all time is Selma. I can name the scene. It\\u2019s when Oprah Winfrey got slapped. This dude slapped the fire\\u2013 It was the second time, not the first time she got slapped, the second time. This dude slapped Oprah Winfrey so hard, she fell in slow motion and there was Negro humming. I left the theater. I couldn\\u2019t even tell you how the movie ended. It was too powerful. My emotions. First of all, Oprah couldn\\u2019t have known she was getting slapped. She didn\\u2019t know. She didn\\u2019t know she was getting slapped. That dude\\u2013 That was Ava DuVernay, that was the director, she made that choice. That\\u2019s a good-ass director, Ava DuVernay went up to that actor between scenes. \\u201cOkay, we love what you\\u2019re doing, okay? \\u201cWe\\u2019re getting a lot of good stuff from you. \\u201cWe\\u2019re just gonna change it up this scene. \\u201cOkay, this time, this time, \\u201cOprah\\u2019s gonna come over, okay? \\u201cShe\\u2019s gonna do her lines, and Oprah, \\u201cshe finishes her lines, you slap the shit out, just\\u2013 slap Oprah.\\u201d \\u201cDoes Oprah know?\\u201d \\u201cNo, do what I tell you! I\\u2019m Ava DuVernay! Slap Oprah!\\u201d Oprah came over to that dude, man. You could see it in her face. She didn\\u2019t know that\\u2013 that slap was coming. \\u201cWe ain\\u2019t leaving till we get our rights.\\u201d Skaboom! \\u266a Oh, freedom \\u266a [humming] Pfft! Pfft! The thing about this country is this: We\\u2019re all Americans. People love to say that. That\\u2019s the first thing people want to say when\\u2013 when there\\u2019s some tension. \\u201cOh, we\\u2019re all Americans. \\u201cYou\\u2019re American and I\\u2019m American. \\u201cWell, just, hell, we all Americans. Can\\u2019t we just be all Americans?\\u201d Yeah, we are. We all Americans. But we live in two different Americas. That\\u2019s what it is. People forget that. And I don\\u2019t think everybody that\\u2026 doesn\\u2019t understand what we go through is necessarily racist or bigoted. That\\u2019s\\u2013 That\\u2019s a far jump. It\\u2019s a lot of folks that just straight up don\\u2019t know what it\\u2019s like. And you gotta educate \\u2019em. You gotta educate \\u2019em on the kind of America you live in. I had to go Best Buy and give a dude some straightening. Straighten his ass out, yeah. I\\u2019m straightening. Dude at Best Buy gonna decide I don\\u2019t need a bag with my purchase. \\u201cYou just have an iPhone case. I figure you could just pop that open.\\u201d No, I ain\\u2019t popping shit. You put it in a bag. I need that in a bag. \\u201cWhat do you need a bag for? \\u201cI don\\u2019t understand why you need a bag. \\u201cIt\\u2019s wasteful. Recycle. Don\\u2019t you care about the Earth?\\u201d I go, \\u201cSir, this has nothing to do with the Earth. \\u201cI\\u2019m a black man in America. I gotta leave this store with a bag, bro.\\u201d [cheers and applause] It\\u2019s about safety. I\\u2019m black, I don\\u2019t get the luxury of just walking out with shit in my hand. That is a roll of the dice. That is a horrifying day if I\\u2013 No, not only do I need that bag, bitch, I need that receipt! And staple it to the outside. I don\\u2019t want a receipt in my hand. You staple my receipt to the outside like Chinese carryout, and I\\u2019ll hold it up in the air, I\\u2019ll \\u201cLion King\\u201d\\u2013 I\\u2019ll \\u201cHakuna Matata\\u201d an iPhone case out of Best Buy. And it\\u2019s not his fault. He just didn\\u2019t understand. He thought he was saving the Earth, but he was saving a life, that\\u2019s what he was doing. This has nothing to do with recycling, man. \\u2018Cause, see, you might be a cool person. He might\\u2013 The cashier might be a cool-ass dude, but we don\\u2019t know what the security guard been through up front. I come prancing out of Best Buy with this naked-ass iPhone case in my hand. And here comes security. \\u201cExcuse me, sir. Did you pay for that?\\u201d Oh, yeah, I got the receipt. \\u201cHe\\u2019s going for a gun!\\u201d Skaboom! \\u266a Oh, freedom, ohh \\u266a Pfft! Pfft! [cheers and applause] Everything ain\\u2019t racism. About 2%, it\\u2019s about 2%\\u2026 that ain\\u2019t racism. You gotta recognize that 2% when you see it. I was in McDonald\\u2019s, this dude was cussing everybody out. Swore it was racism. I walked in this fast food spot, this dude cussing everybody out. And this is the thing, like, fast food spots already do shady stuff, so I\\u2019m not saying they don\\u2019t deserve to be cussed out. They do, they deserve a good cussing every now and then, \\u2019cause the thing they do now, some of these fast food spots, they love to charge you for sauce when you get nuggets. [audience murmurs] You know, you want an extra sauce with your nuggets, it\\u2019s gonna be\\u2013 \\u201cOh, you want another sauce, brother, it\\u2019s gonna be 25 cents.\\u201d How you charging for sauce, bro? That\\u2019s\\u2013 I want two sauces. \\u201cWell, I need a quarter.\\u201d You ever meet the Guardian of the Sauce? This dude is serious. Done got a different color shirt from everybody else at work, so now he arrogant. \\u201cWell, you know, brother, I\\u2019m a supervisor now. \\u201cI have a shirt on. You know, if it was up to me, I would give you another sauce.\\u201d It is up to you! It\\u2019s on your side of the counter! I just want two sauces without paying for \\u2019em, that\\u2019s all I want. But I walked in this spot, man, this dude was cussing out the whole store. Swore it was racism. And I\\u2019m not saying that racism wasn\\u2019t one of the causes for him getting bad service, I\\u2019m just saying, he jumped to that conclusion a little fast. He didn\\u2019t go through the progressions. He ordered a six-piece nugget, and it was five nuggets in the box. And I didn\\u2019t even know what was going on. I\\u2019m texting, as soon as I walk in the door, I\\u2019m texting, I hear this dude, I hear this dude over in the cut, I hear this dude go, \\u201cI\\u2019ll kill everybody in this bitch.\\u201d [laughter and applause] You know, that\\u2013 that gave me pause, \\u2019cause he said he\\u2019ll kill everybody in this bitch. And I already had a foot in the door. Am I technically in this bitch, sir? \\u2018Cause I can pull this foot out and go to Arby\\u2019s. It ain\\u2019t that deep. Swore it was racism, man. \\u201cY\\u2019all stole my nugget. I\\u2019m tired of white folks.\\u201d \\u201cWhite folks don\\u2019t want us to have shit! Stole my nugget!\\u201d Then he gonna turn to me. \\u201cYou see this shit, brother? You see this McDonald\\u2019s? \\u201cIt\\u2019s our nuggets today. It\\u2019s our children\\u2019s nuggets tomorrow.\\u201d \\u201cIf I was white, I\\u2019d have got seven nuggets.\\u201d That\\u2019s when I backed off. I\\u2019m like, I can\\u2019t help this dude. I\\u2019m like, look, bro, I know you mad and there\\u2019s a lot of racial tension in the world, but this ain\\u2019t racism. This is a fast food spot at 2:00 in the morning. Some of them folks back there can\\u2019t count to six. You want six nuggets, you need to order a four-piece and two-piece. That\\u2019s how you trick they ass and get two sauces for free. [cheers and applause] [chuckles] I like fast food employees. I appreciate the fact that fast food employees are rude. I like it. At least it\\u2019s from the heart. \\u2018Cause people too nice now. You go out to these stores, everybody, \\u201cHey, how you doing? Are you good? Thank you for choosing us.\\u201d You think them people wanna be your friend, or they\\u2019ll get fired for not speaking? Which one you think it is? \\u2018Cause 10, 15 years ago, nobody spoke to you when you went in the store. Now, all of a sudden, everybody wanna kick it with your ass? No! That\\u2019s a corporate mandate, and I\\u2019d rather you not do it. I get in the grocery store. It\\u2019s just too many questions at the register. Just ring up the shit that\\u2019s on the belt. We ain\\u2019t gotta be friends. I\\u2019m here, I\\u2019m spending money, you won. What else do you want? Why I gotta be your friend, too, man?\\u201d The price you pay for politeness is your time. So you want somebody to be nice to you? That\\u2019s cool, enjoy it, but I\\u2019d rather get them minutes back with somebody I know. I don\\u2019t need all this politeness, man, I\\u2019m cool. \\u2018Cause people overdo it. I went on a cruise. This is the weirdest thing ever, man. You go on a cruise, you meet every employee. [scattered laughs] Yeah, you been\\u2013 yeah. Every\\u2013 You go on a cruise\\u2013 I met the captain of the boat. The captain of the cruise ship does laps around the boat every day speaking to people. That\\u2019s too much. I have no need to meet you, sir. Listen, there\\u2019s no\\u2013 At no point in my vacation do I need to meet the highest-ranking officer on the boat. I don\\u2019t need to\\u2013 to do that.

It\\u2019s too much. You go on a cruise, it makes you appreciate airline pilots. I respect airline pilots. Airline pilots ain\\u2019t got no chitchat for you, no small talk before the flight. You don\\u2019t even meet \\u2019em. That\\u2019s the flight attendant\\u2019s job. You get on the plane, who you see first? It\\u2019s the flight attendant. \\u201cWelcome aboard, how are you?

[laughter] I don\\u2019t know about marriage, like\\u2026 A lot of my friends are married, and I\\u2019m at this weird age now, I\\u2019m at this weird age, where, like, I got friends getting married late and I got friends that\\u2019s getting divorced. You know, and I don\\u2019t know who to go celebrate with. This my thing about divorce. What I love about divorce, I love how people won\\u2019t shut the hell up about they wedding, but they divorce is none of your business. That\\u2019s not cool. You running your mouth all this time about your engagement, y\\u2019all break up, what happened? I wanna know, tell me what happened. Especially if I went to the wedding. If I went to your wedding and you divorced, I\\u2019m entitled to a one-page explanation, much money as I spent. Either you tell me why y\\u2019all getting divorced or you give me back the toaster I bought your ass. It\\u2019s a good-ass toaster. That\\u2019s four-slice with the crumb tray, that\\u2019s top-shelf. With a bagel button. You all know about that bagel button, that\\u2019s for ballers. My Uncle Derek told me to watch Titanic. \\u201cYou want to learn how to woo a woman, you got to watch \\u2018Titanics.'\\u201d Country for you, \\u201cTitanics.\\u201d \\u201cYou don\\u2019t know how to woo a woman, boy. \\u201cI\\u2019m telling you, \\u2018Titanics\\u2019 show you. \\u201cThat boy Leo DiCaprio, boy, that boy got that girl, boy, \\u201cand that girl was out of his league, he pulled her. \\u201cAnd then he died, he died happy. \\u201cHe was smiling when he was drowning. He float down smiling.\\u201d I went back and watched Titanic. Titanic is not that romantic of a movie. It\\u2019s a good film, but it ain\\u2019t romantic. Titanic is basically a movie about an old lady who got some dick so good\\u2026 that she went back out into the ocean to say good-bye to it. [laughter] That\\u2019s pretty much the movie. Go back and watch Titanic. The whole thing is a flashback. It\\u2019s a 90-year-old lady and she\\u2019s on the bow of a ship. The whole movie\\u2019s a flashback. It\\u2019s a 90-year-old lady, she\\u2019s looking out into the water and then it flashes back to everything that happened on the ship, he drowns, she lives, they come back present day and she\\u2019s looking out into the water and then people are coming up and talking to her. \\u201cMa\\u2019am, are you\\u2013 are you thinking about all your friends you lost out there?\\u201d \\u201cOh, no, baby, I\\u2019m thinking about that good dick \\u201cthat was down there. \\u201cThere\\u2019s some good dick under that water, \\u201cthat\\u2019s what I\\u2019m thinking about. \\u201cRight here, 70 years ago. \\u201cThis is where I got my back beat out. \\u201cDidn\\u2019t you know that? \\u201cRight here. \\u201cYoung gentleman, poverty-stricken, \\u201cput that pipe on me, I couldn\\u2019t handle it. \\u201cJust steaming up and I was pressing my hand \\u201con that car window, that\\u2019s why I walk like this. Give me the jewelry.\\u201d She threw that jewelry into the water. Titanic ain\\u2019t no romantic movie. If anything, it\\u2019s a superhero movie. It\\u2019s a superhero movie. Leo DiCaprio is a superhero, bro. They had sex one time in that movie. Once. They had sex one time in Titanic. And she remembered it for the next 70 years. [laughter and applause] You know how good your pipe game got to be? To put it down once, one time, and for 70 years, that\\u2019s all she can think about. She\\u2019s 90. Think about how much stuff you probably will forget. I know by the time I\\u2019m 90, I\\u2019m not gonna where my\\u2013 I\\u2019m not gonna know where my car is parked, I\\u2019m not gonna know my grandkids\\u2019 names. I\\u2019m gonna have my pills in that Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday trapdoor. But this lady is 90 and she never forgot that one time\\u2013 His dick beat Alzheimer\\u2019s. That\\u2019s a superpower. You gotta respect that. I like old people, man. I hope\\u2013 I hope I\\u2019m blessed enough to\\u2013 to live long, change the diet up, add a couple years on the back end. You know. Old people, I just\\u2013 I want to get to that age where I can just cuss people out for no reason. You know what I\\u2019m saying? Just unprovoked cussed-outs. Yeah, she already smiling. You almost there? You got\\u2026 No, \\u2019cause you look a little young. You got a little more time, but you just\\u2013 You already trained, you already cuss people now. Yeah, man, you old, you get to just cuss people out for no reason. I was in the grocery store, this old dude rolled up on me, man. \\u201cI was in the struggle, motherfucker.\\u201d \\u201cAnd you weren\\u2019t there!\\u201d I wasn\\u2019t bothering this dude. I\\u2019m in produce, I\\u2019m picking out my Fuji apples. I\\u2019m not bothering nobody, Fuji apples. But he rolled up his sleeve, he showed me the scars. Dude\\u2019s old, 80, 85 years old. \\u201cLook at that scar. Ask me\\u2013 ask me how I got the scar.\\u201d How\\u2019d you get the scar? \\u201cI got it in the struggle, motherfucker.\\u201d \\u201cYou don\\u2019t know what it was like in \\u201962.\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cWhat was it like?\\u201d \\u201cIt was a struggle, you son of a bitch.\\u201d And this is the thing, man, this is the thing with old black people, man, old black people, like, you can\\u2019t disrespect \\u2019em, because they have physical proof that they were willing to die to make the country a better place for me, so I have to salute it. I paid for his groceries. This dude called me motherfucker for 20 minutes. And I paid for his groceries. Just off respect. That got me thinking on the way home\\u2026 you know, what have I done? And that\\u2019s\\u2013 that\\u2019s a very sobering feeling, it\\u2019s a sobering realization to have, to realize that what you\\u2019ve done doesn\\u2019t quite measure up to what that man did, you know? This dude called me motherfucker and got free groceries. That\\u2019s how much he put in work. Like, I know I\\u2019m not gonna get that same result. Like, I wish I could, but I know I\\u2019m not, I\\u2019m\\u2013 \\u2018Cause the thing is that you start reflecting, you start reflecting on what you\\u2019ve done that compares to that and I look at the things that I try to do now. Like, I try my best to be socially active. I try my best to do stuff on \\u201cThe Daily Show\\u201d that affects change, I try. [cheers and applause] But\\u2026 I\\u2019ll be real, a lot of what I do now is just making up for lost time, \\u2019cause I wasn\\u2019t always like that, and that\\u2019s something I\\u2019m ashamed about. I didn\\u2019t go see Obama get inaugurated \\u2019cause it was too cold. That was my excuse. That was my excuse for missing history\\u2013 it\\u2019s cold. And my homeboys called me up, \\u201cWe riding the bus, we going up to D.C., let\\u2019s ride the bus.\\u201d I got cable, man. I didn\\u2019t go the second time. I had four years to buy a coat. And still didn\\u2019t go see him. I skipped history twice. That\\u2019s embarrassing. \\u2018Cause sooner or later, my son\\u2019s gonna be doing a book report on that. And he gonna flip to that Obama inauguration page, and you\\u2019re gonna see those thousands of black people out on the National Mall just standing there, and he\\u2019s gonna come to me and I gotta be accountable for my absence. \\u201cDaddy, were you there?\\u201d Yeah, yeah, I was\\u2026 [laughter and applause] Yeah, I\\u2019m right\\u2013 They cropped me out, I was right there on the side. I just hope that, you know, what I try to do now is enough, you know. That\\u2019s all you can do is what you can do, but I want free groceries. And I\\u2019m not sure if what I did is enough, so I might have to just spice up my story, just add whatever happened. \\u2018Cause when I\\u2019m 80, I\\u2019m gonna go in the grocery store, start cussing out kids. You wasn\\u2019t in the struggle, motherfucker! You don\\u2019t know what it was like in 2017. \\u201cWhat was it like?\\u201d It was a struggle in 2017, motherfucker! We tried to march for police reform, I ordered six nuggets, them white folks only gave me five! I had to pay for two sauces! [cheers and applause] Atlanta, I can\\u2019t thank y\\u2019all enough for the time. Thank y\\u2019all so much for coming out, man. Appreciate y\\u2019all. [cheers and applause] Some shit go down in America them white artists go straight to the studio, pen and pad, right? \\u201cI\\u2019m gonna write a new one!\\u201d \\u266a I got a pet eagle his name is Chuck \\u266a\\n\\u266a I feed him bacon and freedom and I fuckin\\u2019 love Chuck, uh-uh \\u266a \\u00a0 Wrong year!

Hey, excuse me. Can I get a ride? No. Okay. Fair enough. Chicago. Well, I have a meeting, and I don\\u2019t know you. It\\u2019s fine. I get that. Why should I even\\u2026 You know, that\\u2019s an odd question to ask. You\\u2019re right. Now that I think about it\\u2026 In the city here, with all the crime and everything, \\u2013 just hop in and get a ride? You\\u2019re right. Best city in the world, baby\\u2026 Chicago. Boom, a local spot\\u2026 Willis Tower, on the corner, of course, of Jackson and Wacker. Now, Jackson and Wacker is famous \\u2019cause of Andrew Jackson and because people used to get whacked. Right below me, the Chicago Pond, a beautiful piece of water. People swim in here. Olympics train in this thing. Jordan actually was inside the mold when they molded him. They cracked it, pulled him out, reassembled it. Boom. Here we are at The Wiener\\u2019s Circle, bro\\u2026 The best hot dog in Chicago. And they treat me like I\\u2019m from here. Come on in. Hey, let me get a hot dog, ladies. How do you want it? You know how I want it, man. What, up your ass or down your fucking throat? Come on, order correctly, pussy lips. Let\\u2019s get it together. Before I continue this tour, I\\u2019m gonna get a drink. Ah, double fisting. Chi Town is a drinking city. Everybody knows that. Ah, beers for the crew, beers for the crew, beers for the crew. Cheers, you guys. Cheers. Okay, we had more planned. We\\u2019re never gonna get to it. You want to know more about Chicago, Google it, okay? Enjoy the special. Cheers. Ladies and gentlemen, it gives me great pleasure to introduce you to my grandson\\u2026 Andrew Santino. We did it. We did it. Yes. Chicago, Illinois, my hometown, how are you? Yes. Crazy. That\\u2019s my grandmother, man. Yeah, that\\u2019s the best thing in the world. My grandmother brought me up. Give it up for Mary Garrity, man. Cheers. Cheers to you guys. Cheers. My grandfather, who passed away, used to say\\u2026 A waitress would bring him water, and he would say, \\u2018What is that?\\u2019 And she\\u2019d say, \\u2018It\\u2019s water.\\u2019 And he said, \\u2018I\\u2019m thirsty, not dirty, so get me a drink.\\u2019 So cheers to my grandpa. Here we are, Chi Town. We did it. We came a long way. We\\u2019re here. I\\u2019m so happy to be back in this city. I\\u2019m back home. It\\u2019s amazing. I\\u2019m feeling the vibe again. You know what I mean? I took a walk around the lake. I was listening to conversations, two guys arguing, yelling at each other with that thick Chicago accent. You know, that\\u2026 Ah, Chicago. It\\u2019s Chicago. \\u2018A\\u2019 s are ahs. Chi-cah-go. And Ts are Ds. Over dere in Chi-cah-go. You know that? \\u2018A\\u2019s, ahs, T, Ds, everyone\\u2019s racist. It\\u2019s such a good city. What a city. I heard two men fighting. Two men were in an argument, in just a verbal argument, not anything bigger than that, just arguing, and the one guy goes, \\u2018You know what? Why don\\u2019t you suck my dick?\\u2019 And the other guy goes, \\u2018Pfft! You suck my dick.\\u2019 And I was like, \\u2018Hey, suck each other\\u2019s dicks, man.\\u2019 That would\\u2019ve been a fight to see, huh? Comes up like, \\u2018You motherfucker.\\u2019 Finish him. Finish him. We got to stop saying it like that. Guys have to stop saying it like that \\u2019cause girls are gonna start believing it. It has a negative connotation when you say that. You go, \\u2018Suck my dick.\\u2019 We say it negative. Suck my dick. You say it like it\\u2019s a bad thing. It\\u2019s the best thing in the world. It\\u2019s the best thing that\\u2019s ever happened to me. We should say it nice. You should go, \\u2018Hey! \\u2018Suck my dick, please, if you have time. \\u2018If you don\\u2019t, it\\u2019s not a big deal. I would love it a lot.\\u2019 I\\u2019m proud of being from this town. I love this town. I miss it a lot. It\\u2019s where my family is from. My family\\u2019s still here. It\\u2019s great to come home, see my parents. They\\u2019re getting older, which is weird. That\\u2019s a hard thing, to see your parents get older\\u2026 Like, honest older, You know when your parents just say shit that when you were a kid, you were like, \\u2018Oh, you never used to say shit like that when I was a kid.\\u2019 Like, my mom was like, \\u2018Well, I\\u2019m gonna leave the house. What are you gonna do for the weekend?\\u2019 And my dad was watching TV, and he turns, and he goes, \\u2018Eat steak, watch porn.\\u2019 I applaud the honesty out of that guy, really sharp. I appreciate that. Tell her the truth, man. They\\u2019re getting older. You know what I mean? They get older, but I love that about these people. They\\u2019re fantastic. They raised me. I mean, did they raise me correctly? I don\\u2019t know. Maybe not. I grew up here in downtown Chicago for half of my life in Chicago. In the second half, we moved to the western suburbs, right? We moved to the suburbs \\u2019cause my sister was born, and my parents were like, \\u2018I\\u2019 m not gonna fuck up two of them. \\u2018We can\\u2019t do that. One\\u2019s good. We\\u2019ll fuck up one. That\\u2019s okay.\\u2019 We moved to the western suburbs, you know, to try to better the life of all of us, but, like, I still realize sometimes how, like, my mom used to fuck with us subtly. Like, my mom is crazy. She\\u2019s a crazy person in the best way, but she would, like, lay it in real slow. Like, my parents were somewhat religious, right? You know, I mean, Irish Catholic kind of. You know what I mean? Like, somewhat in, you know what I mean? They\\u2019re, like, in the hot tub maybe. But she used to do this thing. She used to make me say, every single night before I went to bed, \\u2018Now I lay me down to sleep.\\u2019 Do you know that? Does anybody know that? I used to have to say this. I used to have to repeat this. I \\u2018d say,\\u2019 Now I lay me down to sleep. \\u2018I pray the Lord my soul to keep, \\u2018and if I die before I wake, I pray the Lord my soul to take.\\u2019 I would say that before bed, which is a really fucked-up thing\\u2026 for a child to say out loud. If I die before I wake up? I\\u2019m six. I\\u2019m gonna die in the middle of the night, and God\\u2019s gonna leave my body, take my soul, but be like, \\u2018Body\\u2019 s good. Leave the body. It\\u2019s fine. Leave it.\\u2019 What\\u2019s going on? Crazy person. I love her. She\\u2019s the best in the world. I had Irish Catholic guilt. I had so much Irish Catholic guilt when I was a kid, I used to flip a coin to determine whether or not I was gonna masturbate that day. You think I\\u2019m kidding? I would take a quarter. I would go, \\u2018Heads, yes, tails, no.\\u2019 I\\u2019d flip it, I\\u2019d get tails, and I\\u2019d go, \\u2018Ah, best two out of three. We got to go again. Let \\u2018s see what happens.\\u2019 He didn\\u2019t beat me, never won. That\\u2019s how heavy my guilt was. Seriously, that\\u2019s how, like, in my head I was about that God-is-watching-you type of stuff. Like, my mother used to let us not lock the doors. She was against it. She was like, \\u2018You don\\u2019 t lock the doors inside of the house. \\u2018If you\\u2019 re locking the doors inside of the house, it means you\\u2019re doing something you shouldn\\u2019t be doing.\\u2019 Yeah, that\\u2019s why we lock the doors. Don\\u2019t come in here. I\\u2019m pulling on my body. Get out of here. Leave me alone, lady. That\\u2019s how I realized the guy that invented locks inside of a house must\\u2019ve been caught masturbating by his wife one too many times. He was sick of it. He was sick of it. He\\u2019s like, \\u2018You know what? That\\u2019s it. I\\u2019m gonna put locks inside the house.\\u2019 She \\u2018s like,\\u2019 Michael, what are you doing? \\u2018We have locks on the outside of the house \\u2018to keep criminals from coming inside. There\\u2019s no criminals inside of this house.\\u2019 Yes, there are, Karen, and they\\u2019re robbing me of my freedom. Let me pull on my body in peace. Leave me alone, Karen. Anyway, I love being from this city, and now I live in Los Angeles, California. I live on the other side of this great country. I like it out there. It\\u2019s okay. It\\u2019s a second home for me. It takes some getting used to. It\\u2019s a little bit difficult, but the big difference is, like, when I come back home, you know, like, all my mom wants to do is talk about, like, the weather. Like, that\\u2019s a big thing. My mom is like, \\u2018How is the weather in California? Is it nice like this?\\u2019 It\\u2019s like, \\u2018Yeah, it\\u2019s better than this. That\\u2019s why I\\u2019m out there. What are you talking about?\\u2019 It\\u2019s always better. It\\u2019s always better. It is. There\\u2019s a lot of stuff that isn\\u2019t better, but the weather\\u2019s always gonna be better, and she loves bringing up the \\u2018feels like\\u2019 meter. You know what that is? The news guy. The news guy\\u2019s like, \\u2018It\\u2019s 62. Feels like 68.\\u2019 That\\u2019s Midwest hope. That\\u2019s hope circulating in your body. It\\u2019s the greatest lie ever told. Who\\u2019s the \\u2018feels like\\u2019 guy? I want that job. If that\\u2019s a job, I want it tonight. I\\u2019ll drop this bullshit gig and go do that tonight. The \\u2018feels like\\u2019 guy\\u2026 Greatest gig ever. Here in the studio, it\\u2019s 62 on the barometer. We\\u2019re gonna go live to Andrew Santino. Andrew, what does it feel like? How\\u2019s it going, news team? Like 67. Right back to you guys. Back to you guys, man. It\\u2019s nice, really nice out. It\\u2019s crazy, man, \\u2019cause the weather here fluctuates so much. Like, when I come back, you\\u2019re never surprised. Like, you\\u2019re never surprised by anything in Chicago, but, like, who I feel bad for when I come back is the homeless people. I always feel bad for homeless here, man. Like, I don\\u2019t feel bad for homeless people in L.A. People can get mad at me for saying that. I don\\u2019t give a shit. They\\u2019re awful human beings, these L.A. homeless people. They\\u2019re terrible. They\\u2019re terrible people. I feel bad for Chicago homeless, right? Because they die in the winter, and they die in the summer. They\\u2019re never not dying. They\\u2019re always dying. There\\u2019s, like, a week when it\\u2019s like, \\u2018We might make it,\\u2019 and that\\u2019s it, and they bucket-drum their way through that week. Soldiers, man. So I feel bad for homeless people in Chicago, from my heart, \\u2019cause this is my home. So, when I come home, I give money. I gave money today to a homeless guy. I\\u2019m not lying. I gave money to a homeless guy \\u2019cause I feel bad for him. I know what he\\u2019s got to go through. I gave that money to that guy, right? And I\\u2019ll always do that, but I also want to look him in the eye and go, \\u2018Hey, start walking south. You have nothing to do tomorrow. What are you doing here? You have something on your calendar? You don \\u2018t have a calendar.\\u2019 You can air-fistfight dragons all over this great country. I\\u2019m sure there\\u2019s half-smoked cigarettes strewn across this great land. I mean, the wind is their therapist. That\\u2019s all over the place. They can move about, man. You know the birds? You know those things? You know those guys? When they leave, follow those guys. Birds are born instinctively knowing, when it gets cold, to be like, \\u2018Oh, let\\u2019 s get the fuck out of here. \\u2018It\\u2019 s cold. Let\\u2019s leave. This is ridiculous. Why are we here? This is ridiculous.\\u2019 But I don\\u2019t feel bad for homeless people in Los Angeles at all\\u2026 I really don\\u2019t. I don\\u2019t. I don\\u2019t feel bad for them. Some people are like, \\u2018Oh, that\\u2019s kind of mean.\\u2019 I don\\u2019t give a shit. I don\\u2019t give a shit, \\u2019cause I live amongst these people, and they\\u2019re rude. They\\u2019re rude. You know why they\\u2019re rude? \\u2018Cause they made it. They\\u2019re at the promised land. It\\u2019s 72 degrees outside. You know what it is inside my place? Seventy-two. Who pays for that? I do. Fuck those guys. They won the lottery. They sleep on the beach. I came out of a restaurant, right? I came out of a restaurant. When I first moved there, I had no money. I had zero money. Came out of a restaurant, had some leftovers, went up to a homeless guy, said, \\u2018Hey, sir, I got some leftovers. Would you like this?\\u2019 Okay? I\\u2019m on a date, in front of a lady. Would you like this, sir? And the homeless guy looks up at me, and he says, \\u2018What\\u2019s in it?\\u2019 And I looked at him, and I said, \\u2018Tomorrow.\\u2019 Another day on this earth. What are you, gluten-free? Eat the food. You\\u2019re cock-blocking me, man. I\\u2019m trying to smash a five. Help me out. What are you doing? Why are you doing this? Times are tough. Who are you? But I like it. It\\u2019s my second home. This is my first home. L.A.\\u2019s my second home, and I do like it. There is things about it that I like. I live now in Los Angeles in a neighborhood called West Hollywood. West Hollywood is a gay neighborhood. It\\u2019s kind of like up here. It\\u2019s like where we are right now, Boystown. I like the gay neighborhood. The gay neighborhood is the best neighborhood. I\\u2019ve ever lived in in my life. It\\u2019s safe. It\\u2019s beautiful. I love it. I love it. You get in where you fit in, and I fit into that neighborhood, okay? I\\u2019m not gay, Dad, but\\u2026 I\\u2019m down to live around gay people. They keep it clean and safe. I\\u2019ve never been attacked once in my neighborhood, and by the way, if I did get attacked, I would love to be attacked. What a beautiful way to walk home. A guy leaps out of a bush. Where are you going? Where are you going? Where? Where? Gives me outfit tips. They can fly, you know. I have a lot of gay friends because of that. They\\u2019re people just like you and me. There\\u2019s nothing different. There\\u2019s nothing different about that neighborhood. It\\u2019s cleaner and safer, and I fucking love it. The only difference is, I got a big beard. I\\u2019ve had big beard. I got to keep a big beard for a while. And that\\u2019s okay. Gay guys love guys with beards. Why? I don\\u2019t know. It\\u2019s a thing. It\\u2019s an underbelly thing. It\\u2019s on the Internet. Look it up. And I often get hit on. I get hit on a lot, okay? I get hit on way more in the gay community than in the straight community, and I\\u2019m okay with that. It\\u2019s a confidence booster, fellas. It feels nice. But I\\u2019ve lived in a gay neighborhood for so long that now I\\u2019m picky about what gay guy hits on me. A gay guy hollers at me, and I\\u2019m like, \\u2018All right, you couldn\\u2019t handle it, dude. \\u2018You couldn\\u2019 t handle it. Too tight, too tight. \\u2018Keep walking, man. Pinch it right off. Get up out of here, man.\\u2019 Couldn\\u2019t have it. That\\u2019s some true shit. You got to be careful of social cues. Social cues mean a lot, right? And guys are stupid. Men are stupid. We\\u2019re stupid people by nature. We\\u2019re just dumb. We don\\u2019t give a shit, by the way, when girls are like, \\u2018Men are dumb.\\u2019 I don\\u2019t care. You think I care you think I\\u2019m dumb? I don\\u2019t give a shit. I know I\\u2019m dumb. It feels really good. Try going out your day without talking about a relationship. That\\u2019s what you guys do all day. It\\u2019s like, \\u2018I heard he was with her, but then she was\\u2019\\u2026 And we just walk around like\\u2026 It\\u2019s great. It\\u2019s fantastic. I don\\u2019t worry about shit. It makes my day so much easier, but guys are idiots, and I\\u2019m proud to be an idiot. But social cues amongst men are interesting because you got to be careful what you do in my neighborhood, right? Like, in my neighborhood, it\\u2019s a little bit different, \\u2019cause when I walk down the street and I see another guy, right, I do this thing. If I see you, and I walk down the street, right, we pass each other, and I go like this, what do you do? If I go like\\u2026 Yeah, you dude me right back, right. You dude me right back. He dudes me. We dude it. Hey, dude it. We dude it. Do we know why we dude? No. Zero clue. We walk around like pigeons all day like, \\u2018Hey, hey.\\u2019 We don\\u2019t give a shit. I do it to black guys to show them that I\\u2019m not a pussy. I go, \\u2018Hey, what\\u2019 s up? We good, we good? \\u2018We\\u2019re good. I\\u2019m good with the black guy. \\u2018In case a fight breaks out, we got a black guy. \\u2018We\\u2019 re good. We got one. We\\u2019re good, we\\u2019re good. We got him.\\u2019 I have no idea why we do that. We share genitalia. There\\u2019s no other reason that we do that to one another. But you can\\u2019t do that in my neighborhood \\u2019cause it means something totally different\\u2026 and it hurts. It hurts a lot. I like living there. I do like it. I really do. Like, I like living in Los Angeles. I like progressive culture, okay? I really do. I like the way that people think about other people as humans instead of a subset, right? This country got all up in arms. Everybody voted to make bathrooms gender-neutral. I don\\u2019t know if you know about that, but there was a big debate going on around this country about should we make bathrooms gender\\u2026 Should we be able to let other people use bathrooms that didn\\u2019t initially have that genitalia, right? People that are transsexual. Should we let them use our bathrooms? Ooh, careful. Who knows what could happen? What could happen? Nothing. They\\u2019re gonna shit in your bathroom that you shit in. You think your bathroom\\u2019s that important, where you let go of all your fluids. You care that much about your fluids that you care who comes after. When I go in there, I \\u2018m like,\\u2019 Aah! \\u2018There better be someone else decent that comes in after me. \\u2018I don\\u2019 t want some transsexual coming in after that. Who knows what they \\u2018ll do?\\u2019 Who do you think you are? It was a big debate, gender-neutral bathrooms. And I\\u2019m all for it. Bathrooms are bathrooms. I don\\u2019t give a shit who uses my bathroom after me. Use it. You got to go, go ahead. Use the bathroom, man. It\\u2019s a good thing. For years, I was sick and tired of going to a bar and seeing girls cut the bathroom line when theirs are too long. They walk to the guys, and they go, \\u2018Hi, our line\\u2019 s too long. \\u2018Do you think me\\u2026 Can we cut? Is this chill if we cut?\\u2019 I know that\\u2019s a stereotypical impression. I don\\u2019t give a shit. That\\u2019s real. \\u2018Can we cut?\\u2019 That\\u2019s real. And every asshole in line is like, \\u2018Yeah, go ahead.\\u2019 Also real, also real, also a real impression of us. You go like that. We go like that. Okay? So guys let them in, and I\\u2019m tired of that shit, \\u2019cause we can\\u2019t use your bathrooms. Guys can\\u2019t use girls\\u2019 bathrooms at bars. You can use ours. Why can\\u2019t we use yours? The only thing I ever hear is, \\u2018Well, you pee on the seat.\\u2019 Do we? I don\\u2019t. I don\\u2019t pee on the seat. If you live with someone that pees on the seat, it\\u2019s \\u2019cause they hate your fucking guts. They\\u2019re sending you a message. Oh, no, you get the groceries, Karen, you fucking bitch. Fucking asshole. He\\u2019s saying something to you. That\\u2019s between you two. What do you think? You think we walk in the bathroom, we just open it up, and let it go, and it\\u2019s, like, wherever it goes, it goes. I know where it goes. I got a laser pointer. I know precisely where it goes. Pff, right there. Pee on the seat. That\\u2019s amazing. It\\u2019s ridiculous. To me, I think the fix has always been remove the stalls from men\\u2019s bathrooms in bars. Remove them. Urinals or just holes in the ground, it doesn\\u2019t really matter. Guys will pee into anything. We don\\u2019t really give a shit. But get the stalls out of men\\u2019s bathrooms in bars because they shouldn\\u2019t be there in the first place, okay? They should never have been there, \\u2019cause a girl can\\u2019t walk in now and use a urinal. Unless you can, ladies, and then I want to see it. If you can tippy-toe pee, I would love to see it. I don\\u2019t know if it\\u2019s this way or that way. I don\\u2019t know which way is better, but if you can do that, I want to check it out. But there shouldn\\u2019t be stalls in men\\u2019s bathrooms in bars in the first place, because who the fuck is pooping at the bar? You\\u2019re gonna poop at the bar? You\\u2019re gonna poop here? Steve, you\\u2019re gonna poop at the bar. The bar that we\\u2019re at, you\\u2019re gonna poop at this bar? You feel okay with that as a person, pooping at the bar? Okay, now I know who you really are. Pooping at the\\u2026 Who are your friends? Who\\u2019s your family? Go home, you animal. What are you, you pig person? Poop at the bar? Are you out of your mind? You\\u2019re gross. You\\u2019re a gross human. You don\\u2019t poop at the bar. You man up if you have to poop. You man up if you have to poop. You finish your drink, pinch it off, and you walk home, so you can poop at the house naked like a grown-up\\u2026 like a full-grown adult. If you\\u2019re pooping at the bar that I\\u2019m at and I see you doing that, I\\u2019m gonna walk in, look under, walk out, and go, \\u2018Hey, there\\u2019 s a guy pooping here \\u2018wearing blue Adidas. Blue Adidas, yeah. He \\u2018s pooping right now.\\u2019 And then leave you with your mistake. Why is everybody looking at my shoes? \\u2018Cause you pooped here, Mike. What\\u2019s wrong with you? Get your life locked up, pig. Go home, you pig. Say that next time you see someone pooping in a bathroom. Walk in and go, \\u2018Go home, you pig. You make me sick.\\u2019 Unbelievable, man, how we prote\\u2026 We protect the bathrooms like they\\u2019re a big deal. Who gives a shit about the bathrooms? Dude, go to the bathroom. We protect bathrooms in this country like it\\u2019s something important. It\\u2019s remarkable to me. Sometimes you go to a restaurant, and you\\u2019re like, \\u2018Hey, can I get the key to the bathroom? It\\u2019s locked.\\u2019 They\\u2019re like, \\u2018Oh, yeah, we got the key. Here you go.\\u2019 It\\u2019s attached to a comically large ladle for no reason. You got a spoon on the goddamn thing. Now you got to take that in there, find a place for it. It\\u2019s gonna be a nightmare. Go ahead. You\\u2019re gonna hate every second of that. Why do we do that? We lock them. You keep the bathroom under lock and key? You realize in every restaurant, every restaurant you can walk right in, go right into the kitchen? There\\u2019s no locks on a kitchen. Just walk in and go, \\u2018Hey, what\\u2019s up, you guys?\\u2019 Dunk your hand in some soup. More salt. Needs more salt. I got to go. I want to use the bathroom. You got the key? No. Get real. It\\u2019s a weird country, man. We live in a weird country. We live in a weird time. I didn\\u2019t want to talk about anything that\\u2019s going on right now, but because I got a lot of time, it\\u2019s the late show, I\\u2019ll do whatever the fuck I want. So let me say this. I\\u2019m proud to be from where I\\u2019m from, okay? I\\u2019m proud to be from Chicago, Illinois. I\\u2019m proud to be from the United States of America. I\\u2019m not trying to get on a patriotic kick. All I want to say is, we got some fucked-up things going on in our country. Times are really crazy. It\\u2019s unfortunate as fuck. It\\u2019s awful. People on both sides are blaming people on both sides, okay? I have cops that are in my family. Every cop is not a bad fucking person, and every person isn\\u2019t a bad person, right? These are the same fucking things. So don\\u2019t point fingers at either side. We need to be better people in general, across the fucking board. That\\u2019s it. That\\u2019s it. Good. I\\u2019m a\\u2026 I\\u2019m a guy who recently, thankfully, found a woman who was dumb enough to stick around. Stupid girl, stupid girl. \\u2018Cause look at this, you know. Like, look at guys. You\\u2019re gross. Why would they even go for us? Why would a woman want to do stuff with you? You\\u2019re gross. You\\u2019re disgusting. Look at a naked woman. Take one look at a naked woman, right? Beautiful, symmetrical, hairless. What a creature. Whatever made it finely crafted it like a Ferrari, you know? Took time with it. And then they got to the guy, and they were like, \\u2018Ah, we ran out of time. \\u2018No, put the genitals on the outside. \\u2018It doesn\\u2019 t matter. \\u2018No one\\u2019 s gonna see. Who cares? \\u2018Hair? Throw some hair on it. Fine, throw some hair on it.\\u2019 It\\u2019s phenomenal. Every day we\\u2019ve fooled you. Like, we should wake up, guys, and just be like, \\u2018Ah, tricked them. \\u2018We tricked them again. We got away with murder.\\u2019 I don\\u2019t know how we ever convinced you to do anything in the first place. Kiss me where I pee? Kiss me where I pee? How? How? How? You know that place that you breathe and eat from? May I stuff my dick in there? Can I clog up your source of life with some flesh? Life, the life hole, can I just\\u2026 Cork it? I want to cork it. I want to cork your life hole with my body. How on earth did you say yes? Cork it? It\\u2019s a remarkable thing, when you think about it. Like, how did we ever even start the sexual chemistry to even get to that level of doing stuff? Here you go. A guy can go to a bar. A single guy goes to a bar trying to pick up chicks. He can go out there and mumble around. I want to put my body in your body. That\\u2019s all he\\u2019s saying. Baseline level, I want to put my body in your body. Can we do that? You sound debonair at the bar. You \\u2018re like,\\u2019 Well, well, I work for an investment firm downtown.\\u2019 But what you\\u2019re really saying is, like, \\u2018I want to put my body in your body. I\\u2019d like to put my body inside of your body.\\u2019 That\\u2019s all it is. You\\u2019re not that cool. You\\u2019re just trying to put some of your body in someone\\u2019s body. You got a gap. I got a wedge. Can we do the thing when I put the thing in the thing? That\\u2019s it. Think about that\\u2026 That\\u2019s a hard thing to do, to go out to a bar and convince a girl I\\u2019m the guy that you want to do things with. Think about how hard it was for us to start that. How did we start that? How did a caveman ever get to that point with a cave woman? How did a caveman say that when there was no language, no communication skills? First of all, when you were a caveman, you just stood around with your buddies, mumbling. That\\u2019s it. There\\u2019s really nothing going on, just a lot of\\u2026 Then one of you, out of nowhere, would just get an erection. Explain that to the crew. All your buddies are mad. Hey! They don\\u2019t like it pointing at them. You got to be a nonverbal dick salesman, going up to women like\\u2026 What are you selling? She doesn\\u2019t know. You can\\u2019t say it. Who said yes? The slowest girl in the pack\\u2026 on a bad leg she was lugging around. Okay, okay. Okay. How did that happen? The guy that convinced a girl to do that for the first time invented fire and the wheel that afternoon. It was like\\u2026 Everything clicked. I got it. Everything made sense. I would\\u2019ve loved to see the first caveman to discover pulling out. That would\\u2019ve been amazing. Right? The first guy that\\u2019s like\\u2026 That\\u2019s how all that shit on the wall got started. They were like\\u2026 What, do you think that was ink? That was no ink. It\\u2019s jizz symbols. How great is that fucking thing? My buddy\\u2019s an artist, and I was like, \\u2018I want a fucking papa bear \\u2018with a cubby bear with a Blackhawks headdress, \\u2018and I want him wearing Jordans for the Bulls \\u2018and white socks, and I want him eating deep dish and drinking a beer.\\u2019 And my buddy smoked enough pot as I did, and he came up with this. So it was fucking pretty amazing. The Chicago flag, yeah. Cool. It\\u2019s cool. We got a lot of pride in this town, so we should. You know what I mean? You can\\u2019t fuck with us. Come fuck with us. Where\\u2019s my crane camera? Come fuck with us, rest of the United States. Where the fuck are you guys at? Come to Chicago. Rip your fucking throats out. I\\u2019m gonna get murdered on the road in Cincinnati in, like, three months. Shit. No, I got a lady. I got a lady this year. I got locked up. I got married this year, which was great. It was a great thing. Don\\u2019t clap for that. Please don\\u2019t clap for that shit \\u2019cause it eggs her on, and I don\\u2019t need that. No, I got married, and it was great. It was very fun. We had a good time. Yeah, it was fun. Thanks a lot. Cool. It was cool, it was cool. She came up to me at the jump, and she was like, she \\u2018s like,\\u2019 What do you think about doing, like, bachelor, bachelorette parties, like, all that stuff?\\u2019 We didn\\u2019t talk about, like, really any of that stuff. We really kind of didn\\u2019t really get into the nitty-gritty, and I was like, \\u2018Well, whatever you want to do.\\u2019 She was like, \\u2018Do you want to have a bachelor party?\\u2019 And I was like, \\u2018I don\\u2019 t know. \\u2018Like, I do stand-up for a living, \\u2018so, like, it\\u2019 s just always kind of a fucking bachelor party. My life is kind of a bachelor party.\\u2019 I was like, \\u2018No, I\\u2019m good.\\u2019 You know what I mean? Like, I just took my best friend for his bachelor party, and I was like, \\u2018That\\u2019s good enough for me.\\u2019 I was like, \\u2018You can do a bachelorette party. Don \\u2018t feel like you can\\u2019t.\\u2019 She was like, \\u2018Are you cool with it?\\u2019 I was like, \\u2018I promise. I\\u2019m totally cool with it. Whatever you want to do, you \\u2018re good. Do it.\\u2019 She was like, \\u2018Okay, trust me. It \\u2018ll be classy.\\u2019 That\\u2019s some dumb shit. Girls are like, \\u2018It\\u2019 s gonna be classy. \\u2018The bachelorette party\\u2026 It\\u2019s gonna be cla\\u2026 I promise. We won\\u2019t be as crazy as you think we\\u2019re gonna be.\\u2019 She was like, \\u2018We\\u2019 re going to Northern California \\u2018to a vineyard. We \\u2018re gonna do wine tasting.\\u2019 So in girls\\u2019 brains, they think that we think that that\\u2019s nice and sweet, but I know the truth. I know they\\u2019re not wine tasting. I know they\\u2019re blacking out on wine. I know they\\u2019re getting purple toothed out, Charlie Chaplain-ing around town like\\u2026 I know. I know what you\\u2019re doing, looking like Grimace. I know. I know. Lie to me, you drunks\\u2026 trying to pretend like\\u2026 We pretend like wine is so sophisticated. It\\u2019s still booze. Stinky-foot grapes, that\\u2019s all it is. Go on a vineyard tour with her girlfriends. See, \\u2019cause here\\u2019s the thing about bachelorette parties. I\\u2019m sure every girl in this room is a wonderful human being. I\\u2019m sure you\\u2019re all stand-up citizens until you get in a bachelorette party, and then you\\u2019re a piece of shit. Then you\\u2019re a piece of shit. Then you storm around town like, \\u2018Look at us, penises everywhere. \\u2018Penises on our body. \\u2018Penis necklace. These are dick-laces. \\u2018These are dick necklaces. This is a dick hat. \\u2018These are dick glasses. They\\u2019re dick shoes. \\u2018Look at it. It comes. This one comes. \\u2018It comes out of that shoe. When I go like that, it comes.\\u2019 What\\u2019s wrong with you? Who are your parents? Shame on you, these women who walk around town doing that shit. It\\u2019s unbelievable\\u2026 Bachelorette parties that take over every bar they go to, screaming. These bitches work in HR during the day, but at night\\u2026 they\\u2019re just like, \\u2018Penis, penis, penis. Penis, penis, penis, penis.\\u2019 Who are your parents? Shame on you. You realize some little kid in China has to make those penis molds? Some little kid in China is pressing penises, penis sunglasses, so you can go out like, \\u2018Cocks, cocks on my head.\\u2019 You psycho. That\\u2019s where guys beat you. That\\u2019s, like, the one spot we beat you. We may be dumber than you, but we beat you there. We beat you by a landslide, because I have never been to a bachelor party where they\\u2019re like, \\u2018Santino, you ready to go? Put on your pussy costume. Let \\u2018s go.\\u2019 I put one on like\\u2026 \\u2018Come on, let\\u2019 s go. \\u2018Get mine wet. Steve, get mine wet. \\u2018Get it wet. Get the clit wet. \\u2018Go. Get it wet. This is what we want.\\u2019 \\u2018Vaginer.\\u2019 We beat you. So we went and got married out of the country. We went to Costa Rica. We went down to Costa Rica. It was great. Central America, beautiful place. Costa Rica is amazing. We loved it. It was fantastic. I didn\\u2019t know that racism is everywhere. I had no idea, but it is, but it really fucking is. Here we are in our hotel, two men are in a fight with one man, two guys on one, two on one, working this dude, and I look out the window, and I\\u2019m like, \\u2018Oh, my God, what happened?\\u2019 To the local guy. And the local guy, who we know, who we\\u2019re buddies with, is like, \\u2018Oh, yeah, the fight?\\u2019 And I was like, \\u2018Yeah, what happened?\\u2019 I\\u2019m ready for the story. And he \\u2018s like,\\u2019 Okay, you see this guy on the ground? \\u2018You see him on the ground, \\u2018this guy who they kick in the face? \\u2018You see him? \\u2018You know, this guy on the ground they kick in the teeth. You see him?\\u2019 I was like, \\u2018Yeah, yeah, definitely. Yeah, what is that?\\u2019 And he goes, \\u2018Oh, yeah, this guy, this guy on the ground, he \\u2018s from Panama.\\u2019 What? \\u2018He\\u2019 s from Panama. Panama, the country. Panama.\\u2019 That\\u2019s it? That was as deep as the well got dug. \\u2018He\\u2019s from Panama.\\u2019 That\\u2019s it. I was like, \\u2018But how did the fight\\u2026 Like, how did you\\u2026 How did the fight happen?\\u2019 He goes, \\u2018Oh, s\\u00ed, s\\u00ed, s\\u00ed, s\\u00ed, s\\u00ed, s\\u00ed. \\u2018Okay, so this guy on the ground, \\u2018he cut off this guy in traffic, \\u2018and he says to him, \\u2018Hey, what the fuck?\\u2019 \\u2018And this guy, he says, \\u2018Hey, man, fuck you.\\u2019 \\u2018So this guy, he gets out of his car, \\u2018and he says, \\u2018Mm-mm, fuck you.\\u2019 \\u2018So then they yell at each other. \\u2018So this guy say fuck you. \\u2018This guy, fuck you.

What are you talking about?\\u2019 \\u2018And then his friend, he hear him from across the street, \\u2018and his friend, he says, \\u2018Hey, what happened?\\u2019 \\u2018He says, \\u2018He said, fuck you.\\u2019 \\u2018He says,\\u2019 Ah, fuck you.\\u2019 \\u2018He says, \\u2018Fuck you.\\u2019 He says. \\u2018Fuck you.\\u2019 He fuck\\u2026 these guys over here are fucking you.\\u2019 \\u2018And the one guy, he says to him\\u2026 \\u2018Before he fight with him, he says, \\u201dHey, motherfucker, where are you from?\\u2019 \\u2018And this guy, he says, \\u2018Panama.\\u2019 \\u2018And, uh\\u2026 That \\u2018s it for him.\\u2019 Other than that, it was a beautiful country, man. It was gorgeous, man. We did so much white-people shit. It was unbelievable. You know what white-people shit is. Everybody in here knows it, right? It\\u2019s, like\\u2026 We went zip-lining. It\\u2019s, like, white-water rafting, all that white-people\\u2026 White-water rafting is white-people shit. It\\u2019s called white-water rafting. It\\u2019s ours. That\\u2019s some white-people shit. You\\u2019ll never, ever see a black guy white-water rafting, skydiving, drinking coffee. That\\u2019s just not what they do. It\\u2019s not what they do. Skydiving, all that shit. Black guy, do you go skydiving? Never in your fucking life, man. No way. Never in your life. Rock climbing? No way. White-water rafting? No. None of the above. Do you even like coffee? I do like coffee. Oh, come on, man. What did he say? I like it black. You like it black. I get that. I get that. You can have that. Take it black. Take it black. So he knows what I\\u2019m talking about. He knows. I went to college with\\u2026 One of my closest friends in college was this dude we lived with, and he would always make fun of me. He \\u2018s like,\\u2019 You\\u2019re doing some white-people shit, Red. You on some white-people shit right now.\\u2019 I was like, \\u2018I\\u2019m taking out the trash.\\u2019 He\\u2019s like\\u2026 \\u2018That\\u2019s the type of shit I\\u2019m talking about, motherfucker. \\u2018Just throw that shit outside, bitch. \\u2018White-people shit! \\u2018What you doing, dishes, motherfucker? You white-ass motherfucker.\\u2019 What you doing, laundry, you Charmin-ass motherfucker? You Charmin\\u2019\\u2026 I did so much white-people shit in Costa Rica. It was bananas. I loved it, though. I love being a tourist. Like, that\\u2019s the fucked-up thing about Americans. We don\\u2019t want to be tourists. Why not? Why are we so afraid of being tourists? I\\u2019ll do that zip-line dork-ass shit. Give me the helmet. I love that. How much is the picture? $1,000? I don\\u2019t give a shit. I\\u2019ll pay for that, plan for it. Come on, man. Give me that dork tourist shit. We\\u2019re so afraid as Americans to be tourists. Yet for some reason, tourists come here. They\\u2019re not afraid to be tourists. You can go to Michigan Avenue right now. There\\u2019s a cute little Italian couple that\\u2019s like, \\u2018Mi scusi, mi scusi, mi scusi. The water tower, the water tower.\\u2019 And you \\u2018re like,\\u2019 Ah, come here. Let me lie to you. Come here, come here, come here.\\u2019 Let them be tourists, man. Be a tourist. Be a tourist. All I\\u2019m saying is, stop being such a liar. Be who you really are. You\\u2019re out of the country. Be out of the country, man. There\\u2019s nothing wrong with that, you know. Here\\u2019s why. Every time I\\u2019ve ever been to a Spanish-speaking country, there\\u2019s always one guy in the crew, one dude who\\u2019s like, \\u2018Hey, I got us. I can take us around. \\u2018I speak a little bit of Mexican. \\u2018We\\u2019 re gonna be good. We \\u2018ll be good.\\u2019 You speak Mexican, Brad? I speak Mexican, dog. I got us. Don\\u2019t sweat it, man. I took 101 in high school. We\\u2019re gonna be straight. And you\\u2019re like, \\u2018All right, man. I can\\u2019t wait.\\u2019 You walk into a restaurant. I say the truth. I walk in, I go, \\u2018Hello, American, americano, \\u2018American, ready to be ripped off. Look at me.\\u2019 \\u2018Cause I don\\u2019t give a shit. How much is that Coke? Seven? Thought it was ten. You can\\u2019t fuck me. You can\\u2019t fuck me. I planned for that. You cannot fuck me. But he walks in. Brad walks in, talking Mexican like, \\u2018Hola, seniors. Hola, seniors.\\u2019 He thinks he\\u2019s the shit. Brad walks in heavy, and the staff looks at him like, \\u2018Okay, okay, okay, okay. \\u00bfHabla espa\\u00f1ol, se\\u00f1or? \\u00bfHabla espa\\u00f1ol? \\u00bfHabla espa\\u00f1ol?\\u2019 S\\u00ed, s\\u00ed, sen-yours. S\\u00ed, s\\u00ed, sen-yours. Ha-blah a-spaniel. Ha-blah a-spaniel. Ha-blah a-spaniel. And they \\u2018re all like,\\u2019 Okay. \\u2018Hmm. Good, good, good. That\\u2019s good, good. That\\u2019s good.\\u2019 And they just machine-gun Spanish at his fucking head until you see him go, \\u2018Oh, fuck. \\u2018There\\u2019s no bibliotecain there. Where\\u2019s the ban-yo? I don\\u2019t know any of those words.\\u2019 Brad looks like an asshole. Meanwhile, I\\u2019m enjoying my plate of rice and \\u2018polo,\\u2019 having a great time\\u2026 enjoying my life. I came back from Costa Rica. It was fantastic, and then we got into that, like, all the marriage discussion shit. She was like, \\u2018What do you want to do about the last name?\\u2019 I was like, \\u2018I don\\u2019 t know. I mean, I don\\u2019t really care. I don\\u2019t think I really care.\\u2019 I was like, \\u2018I mean, what do you want to do?\\u2019 She\\u2019s like, \\u2018Well, do you want me to take your last name?\\u2019 And there\\u2019s a part of you that\\u2019s like, \\u2018No, man, it\\u2019s cool.\\u2019 Then there\\u2019s a part of you that\\u2019s like, \\u2018Yeah, you got to take the last name.\\u2019 It\\u2019s some male-ego bullshit, but that\\u2019s the truth of the situation. Like, it doesn\\u2019t really mean much. Like, what are last names anyway? I don\\u2019t really know. We don\\u2019t really know, you know. Last names\\u2026 you used to give to somebody \\u2019cause it represented land, right? You had some land. You get some land to give. Like, \\u2018This will all be yours one day.\\u2019 That doesn\\u2019t mean shit nowadays. I can\\u2019t be like, \\u2018Son, this condominium will be yours when I die.\\u2019 Who gives a shit, right? There\\u2019s not much to it. You know, it really doesn\\u2019t mean much. But it\\u2019s strange when I think about, like, white people\\u2019s last names, like, where our last names came from. A lot of times, it used to be your occupation, right? Like, I meet a guy\\u2026 Kevin Blacksmith. His great-great-great-great- grandfather was a blacksmith. Dave Shoemaker, his great-great-great-great- grandfather was a shoemaker. But it\\u2019s weird when you meet a white guy named Eric Lynch\\u2026 \\u2018Cause you\\u2019re like, \\u2018Your great-great-great-great- grandfather was a bad person.\\u2019 Switch it up, dog. But last names are kind of bullshit. You know know what I mean? They mean whatever they want and whatever you want them to mean, and so she said, \\u2018What do you want to do?\\u2019 I said, \\u2018How about we just go with whosever last name is cooler?\\u2019 Right, whosever\\u2019s is cooler. She was like, \\u2018Cooler?\\u2019 I was like, \\u2018Yeah,\\u2019 \\u2019cause in my head, I knew it was already game over. I was like, \\u2018Jordan, buckets.\\u2019 I knew it was over. I knew it was over. She wasn\\u2019t fucking with Santino. What a cool-ass name, Santino. Three syllables\\u2026 San, unh, ti, got you, oh. That\\u2019s what\\u2019s up. I had it. It was in the bag, man. It was in the bag. It was game over. Jordan. It was game over, but then she was like, \\u2018Oh, you think your last name is that much cooler?\\u2019 I said, \\u2018Yeah.\\u2019 Her last name was Eichelberger. You want me to say it again? Eichelberger. And she\\u2019s like, \\u2018What\\u2019s wrong with that?\\u2019 I was like, \\u2018What\\u2019 s right with that shit? What are you talking about, lady?\\u2019 She\\u2019s like, \\u2018It\\u2019s not that big of a deal.\\u2019 I said, \\u2018Well, it\\u2019s like part of the Third Reich.\\u2019 I\\u2019ll have to walk into restaurants, like\\u2026 \\u2018We\\u2019 re here for the Eichelberger party, \\u2018the party of two. \\u2018There is two of us at the party. \\u2018We would like the table in the back of the room. \\u2018In the back of the room, \\u2018behind the air-conditioning, please. Thank you.\\u2019 Anyway, she\\u2019s a Santino now. Yeah. We got into a thing, \\u2019cause I was\\u2026 I feel like I\\u2019m watching too much porn lately, if I\\u2019m just being real with you guys. We\\u2019re getting real. It\\u2019s a late-night show. I was watching too much porn. Porn is bad. It\\u2019s a bad thing. It\\u2019s really addictive. It is. It truly is. I think it\\u2019s not my fault, though. I think it\\u2019s access\\u2026 access, too much access. In your pockets, there\\u2019s a phone, right? In there is all the porno\\u2026 All of it\\u2026 all of it that we make. All of it that we make, you guys. If I had three seconds inside of a time machine, I would \\u2018zorb\\u2019 myself to when I was 14, for three seconds, and just go\\u2026 \\u2018In the future, all the porno\\u2019s in your pocket,\\u2019. And get out\\u2026 and blow my mind. Just\\u2026 semen everywhere. Oh, my God. I\\u2019m waiting for this JPEG to load. Come on, man. That\\u2019s crazy. That is crazy to think about. It really is too much access. Like, I can\\u2019t walk past a laptop without being like\\u2026 \\u2018Ah, this is Best Buy. I got to go.\\u2019 The Blue Shirts, they don\\u2019t like that. You know what I mean? They get weird. We\\u2019ve seen so much of it. The problem is\\u2026 With porn is, it\\u2019s got this stigma where we think we can emulate that stuff. Like, you think you\\u2019re like them. You\\u2019re not like them. Those are pros, man. Those are pros. I got envy. I have envy, envy. The way that these men throw a rope is remarkable. They just\\u2026 It takes off. It\\u2019s got loft. Are you kidding me? I\\u2019m lucky if mine comes out. It\\u2019s like a pensive army. It gets to the surface, and it \\u2018s like,\\u2019 No, no. Go back, go back.\\u2019 And when it does come out, it\\u2019s late for the party. It has nonalcoholic beer. It\\u2019s like, \\u2018Sorry. We\\u2019re here.\\u2019 My wife\\u2026 one night she was like, \\u2018Oh, come on my tits.\\u2019 I was like, \\u2018Oh, I\\u2019ll never make it up there.\\u2019 It\\u2019s so far. It\\u2019s too far. Maybe your belly button, max\\u2026 if I really put in the work. I\\u2019ll tell you what I\\u2019ve been watching a lot of. I\\u2019ve been watching a lot of black porn, lots of black porn. Blackblack. Too. Like, chocolate, chocolate, chocolate, chocolate. Deep chocolate, 99% cacao chocolate. Sexy. No milk. Get out of here, milk chocolate. No time for you. Chocolate, chocolate. I love watching black porn, love watch\\u2026 For one fundamental reason. The guys get to wear shoes\\u2026 on their feet. Men wear shoes on their feet. If you know anything about how shoes and pants work, anything at all, you know that these men took off their shoes, took off their pants and underwear, and then put back on their shoes. Come on. You did it again, black people. Numero uno. I got the envy, man. It\\u2019s a bad thing. It really is. It\\u2019s a bad thing. We need to clean up our minds, clean up our life. You know what I mean? Get clean, clean living. Eat a smoothie, take a walk. It\\u2019s difficult, man. It\\u2019s difficult to do. People always\\u2026 like, listen, I try to work out. I\\u2019m trying to be in shape. I\\u2019m trying to do all that stuff. It\\u2019s a hard thing to do. You know, fast food, going to get fast food always reminds me of what it was like when I was single, going to a one-night stand. It was like the same thing, like the exact same feeling. You\\u2019ll be looking on Google Maps to try to find out if that fast-food joint\\u2019s open, right? You\\u2019re like, \\u2018You up, McDonald\\u2019s? You up?\\u2019 You send a late-night text, like, \\u2018What\\u2019 s up, girl? \\u2018You up? What\\u2019s up, McDonald\\u2019s? \\u2018You up? What\\u2019s up, Mac D\\u2019s? Is you up, playboy? Give me them nuggets.\\u2019 She\\u2019s like, \\u2018Uh-huh.\\u2019 McDonald\\u2019s is like, \\u2018You know it.\\u2019 You cruise over there, and on the way, you\\u2019re like, \\u2018Ooh, it\\u2019 s gonna be good. \\u2018I know what I get at this location. \\u2018This is my favorite spot to go to at this time of night. That number two is my spot right now.\\u2019 That\\u2019s a butt joke. You get over there, and you eat that. You devour that McDiesel\\u2019s. Just like that, you\\u2019re like\\u2026 Devour it. And when you\\u2019re done, you get in the car and cruise home\\u2026 Same feeling. Cruising home, and you\\u2019re like\\u2026 \\u2018I\\u2019m a bad person, man.\\u2019 Sad. I had to cut that out. I had to cut it out, man. I\\u2019m trying to stay healthy. I\\u2019m trying to fit into my own skin. That\\u2019s really what it is. You know, I\\u2019m trying to feel good about myself. It\\u2019s a confidence thing about people. You want to feel confident and cocky, but, like, not too much. Like, I had my ego tested. I got into a car accident. A man hit me. A man hit me. I was at a red light. A man hit me, okay? Red light, skrrr, man, bmm-bmm-bmm, hit me, and I got out of my car. He got out of his car, and I went to say something. Before I could say anything, he goes, \\u2018Hey, what the fuck?\\u2019 And I said\\u2026 \\u2018That\\u2019 s my line. \\u2018I say that. That\\u2019s me. \\u2018I\\u2019m doing\\u2026 That\\u2019s what I do. You say, \\u2018I\\u2019m sorry,\\u2019 I feel like.\\u2019 He was a big-ass dude. He was big, jacked up, and he had tattoos up to his face? Question mark. You good, bro? On your face? You cashed out? You got cancer? What\\u2019s up? On your face? I feel like that\\u2019s some, like, \\u2018I don\\u2019t give a\\u2026 \\u2018Whatever, bro. Go ahead. It\\u2019s done. \\u2018I don\\u2019 t give a shit. \\u2018I\\u2019 ve been collecting Marlboro miles for years. I \\u2018ll cash out.\\u2019 On your face? So I had no way to win this war. This dude was in my face. I had no\\u2026 I was backed up. I was like, \\u2018Whatever, man.\\u2019 And in that moment, I was like, \\u2018I can\\u2019 t win this argument with this dude. I can \\u2018t beat him physically.\\u2019 But I was like, \\u2018If I had a superpower right now, \\u2018you know, it wouldn\\u2019 t be to, like, fly or be invisible. I would love to be able to throw acne on somebody.\\u2019 Right? He\\u2019s all, \\u2018Fuck you.\\u2019 I\\u2019m like, \\u2018Fuck me? Fuck you, man.\\u2019 No! Hit him all over the body, shoulder, bacne. Hit him with the bacne. Hit him with the kn-acne, that knee acne. Light him up, light him up. Scar him physically and emotionally, send him home like that for a couple of weeks, depending on the topical cream. Let it sit. Let it sit. If you\\u2019re not laughing at that, you didn\\u2019t have acne when you were a kid. I had really bad acne when I was a kid, man. It was so bad. It was so bad. Like, acne is, like, the sole reason I questioned God. I\\u2019m like, \\u2018What up, dude? What\\u2019s the deal? \\u2018Where are you at on this one, player? This is ridiculous.\\u2019 Here you are, 13, 14 years old. You\\u2019re the ugliest version of yourself. Look at photos of you at 14. TBT them on Instagram, and you\\u2019re like, \\u2018Ooh, tough-looking kid.\\u2019 You\\u2019re ugly, bro. You are ugly at 14. Teenagers are so gross to look at, hard to see. They\\u2019re hard to see, bro. They\\u2019re skinny. Their voices are crackling. They\\u2019re wobbling all over like little skinny baby giraffes, just hungry and horny like\\u2026 Nasty-looking crea\\u2026 They look like Tim Burton cartoons. They\\u2019re barely alive. You are nasty as a child. And you\\u2019re telling me at this vulnerable point in your life, God is gonna be like, \\u2018You know what? \\u2018I\\u2019 m gonna put some red pus bumps on his face. Pus bump his face up.\\u2019 I didn\\u2019t get it. I didn\\u2019t understand it. I had it so bad. I had to go on Accutane. You used to have to sign a form that said. \\u2018I can die from this medication.\\u2019 What\\u2019s up, guys? What are we saying? I can die from this medi\\u2026 I can die from this medication. And I was underage, so I had a legal guardian. So my mother had to sign it. I was 16. I\\u2019ll never forget. They slipped the sheet to my mother, and she looked at it, and then she looked at me. Yeah. Yeah, this is\\u2026 it\\u2019s\\u2026 it\\u2019s better than your face. It doesn\\u2019t really matter. You\\u2019re an ugly kid. You\\u2019re ugly. It\\u2019s\\u2026 it\\u2019s for you. I had it so bad. I had acne so bad when I was young. When I was in high school, I played basketball for a couple years at my high school until I found out about drugs, and I was like, \\u2018See you later, basketball.\\u2019 Ah, true story. But I played basketball for a little while. When I played basketball, I made the JV team pretty early on, and we played in a summer league, okay? In the summer league, you had to play all the other schools that you were going to play in that regular season, and I\\u2019ll never forget. We went out to West Aurora to go play these guys, and they were supposed to beat us. They were, like, a really good school, right? They were really good. They were an all-black school. We were a some-black school. They were gonna beat us. Bottom line, they were gonna win. And we went out there, and we beat the shit out of these guys. I had the game of my life. I dropped four points. I was on fire. If you know anything about high-school basketball, four points is like, whoa. What are you, MVP? Final score, 12-2. It was a blowout. I mean, we went out there. I had a great game. I was on cloud nine. I felt like a king. Then I left, and I went out to the hallway to go get a drink of water. I\\u2019m getting a drink of water, bending down by the water fountain to have a drink of water. A little black kid, like, eight years old walks in the hallway. Comes up to me and goes, \\u2018Hey, yo, white boy. White boy.\\u2019 I go, \\u2018What\\u2019s up?\\u2019 You\\u2019re pretty good, man. Oh, thanks, man. He goes, \\u2018For a white boy.\\u2019 And I was still like, \\u2018Thank you. I appreciate that.\\u2019 I\\u2019ll take it. Then he goes, \\u2018All right, man.\\u2019 I go, \\u2018All right, man.\\u2019 He walks away. Felt good. Go down to get some more water. He gets to the doorway. He stops\\u2026 real Forest Whitaker-style. He turns around and goes, \\u2018Hey, yo, white boy.\\u2019 I say, \\u2018What\\u2019s up, man? What up?\\u2019 He goes, \\u2018What the fuck is all over your face?\\u2019 That still hurts today. I\\u2019m in my 30s. That cut went all the way to the bone. You know what I mean? Then I walked up to him slowly, and I said, \\u2018Well, this is what happens when your dad sticks around.\\u2019 No, I didn\\u2019t say that. That\\u2019s a joke, man. No, I called him the N word. Then I got out of there as fast as I could. No, stop it. I cried on the bus, man. I cried on the bus. Got to have a sense of humor, man. But I always loved black people. I always did. I really did. I still do. I still do love black people, man. I think they\\u2019re fantastic human beings. Black people always accepted me. Black people really did. White people never liked me. White people don\\u2019t like redheads for some reason. There\\u2019s this thing. White people see redheads, and they\\u2019re like, \\u2018What do we do with it?\\u2019 They don\\u2019t like us. They don\\u2019t trust us. They make a day to kick us. Call us names\\u2026 \\u2018You fire crotch, you ginger.\\u2019 They ask us stupid questions, like does the carpet match the drapes? A black guy\\u2019s never said that to me. White guys\\u2026 \\u2018The carpet match the drapes, bud?\\u2019 And I\\u2019m always like, \\u2018Are you a grown-up asking \\u2018about my penis hair? \\u2018Is that the level that you\\u2019re on? \\u2018You\\u2019 re worried about my penis hair, dude. \\u2018If you must know, it\\u2019s hardwood floors. There \\u2018s no carpet there, bro.\\u2019 I clean it up. Go get you a little buzzer from Target and clean that shit up. You get under there. It\\u2019s like\\u2026 It\\u2019s working overtime under there. That\\u2019s the no-fly zone, no-fly zone. It might die under there, like\\u2026 I can\\u2019t, I can\\u2019t. White people never liked me. They never did. They always made fun of me. That\\u2019s a reality check. Now people are like, \\u2018Huh? What are you talking about?\\u2019 White people always made fun of redheads. Redheads are this outcast. We\\u2019re this weird minority for some reason, but black people always liked me. They really did. They took to me. Like, black people like white people with a deficiency. I\\u2019m like a dog with one bad leg. You know, white people don\\u2019t adopt that dog, but black people are like, \\u2018No, no, no. \\u2018He good, he good, he good. \\u2018He gonna be fine. Come here, Tripod. \\u2018He gonna be fine. Tripod. \\u2018Come here, Tripod. It gonna work out.\\u2019 That\\u2019s just the truth. It just made me feel normal when I was a kid. So I loved hip-hop culture. I loved everything all my black friends liked, so much so that in the \\u201990s, people used to say this word. People used to call me a \\u2018wigger.\\u2019 Do you remember that word? Don\\u2019t get uncomfortable. You all said it. You all said it. I don\\u2019t know why we got rid of it. It was hilarious. You should\\u2019ve stuck around for a while. People used to call me a \\u2018wigger.\\u2019 People used to say \\u2018wigger\\u2019 to me \\u2019cause they thought it would hurt my feelings. They thought, like, that was a way to get my goat. You know what I mean? And I\\u2019ll never forget. I was on a basketball court the first time I heard it, and we had won this basketball game, and this dude from the losing team says\\u2026 \\u2018Whatever, bro. That dude ain\\u2019t nothing but a wigger.\\u2019 And all my black friends heard it, and they were disappointed. They heard him say that, and they were like\\u2026 That\\u2019s how they sound, like a train. They were like\\u2026 When black guys are bummed out, it sounds like a train, just\\u2026 Next stop, Sedgwick. But they were bummed out \\u2019cause that was an attack, you know. They didn\\u2019t like that, but when I heard it, I heard it different, \\u2019cause they were like, \\u2018That white dude ain\\u2019t nothing but a wigger.\\u2019 And I heard it, and I was like, \\u2018Oh\\u2026 so close.\\u2019 How do I get that N? How do I get that N? These are Karl Kani jeans. This is a Perry Ellis shirt. Give it to me. I bought Timberland boots. Say it if you\\u2019re gonna say it, you racist motherfuckers. Say it. How do I get that, man? It was just me being real. That\\u2019s all that was. I wanted to be a black guy. I thought I was black. I thought I was a black guy. Even to this day, I still have a lot of black friends, and I got to tell you\\u2026 Every time I talk to my black guy friends, I\\u2019m always like, \\u2018Hey, man, don\\u2019t date white girls.\\u2019 Don\\u2019t date white girls. Not \\u2019cause I\\u2019m racist. I\\u2019m clearly not racist. I have black friends. I\\u2019m not a racist. I tell my black guy friends to not date white girls \\u2019cause I genuinely care about the future of sports. That\\u2019s it. We don\\u2019t need any placekickers and long snappers. We want dunk contests, right? How do you get a Heisman? You know what I mean? Not from Jerome and Cassie. Jerome and Jaquanda\\u2026 That\\u2019s how we\\u2019re gonna make a Heisman, two beautiful chocolate people making love under a beautiful chocolate rain shower while he\\u2019s got shoes on. We know the formula. We know the formula. Drake is the number-one dude in hip-hop. His name is Aubrey. Yeah! We let him get away with that. Drake\\u2019s name is Aubrey, and nobody said shit about it. Aubrey, number one in hip-hop. What\\u2019s his name, Aubrey? Got it. Okay, cool. We\\u2019re good. He had beef with Meek Mill. It was a big beef. You\\u2019re it. Tag, you\\u2019re it. You\\u2019re it. Tag. Remember real beef? You remember when hip-hop was, like, real beef? People hated each other. Tupac and Biggie hated each other so much, and they were best friends at one point. They had real beef so deep that Tupac started a song called \\u2018Hit \\u2018Em Up\\u2019\\u2026 Before he started the lyrics, he goes, \\u2018So I fucked your bitch, you fat motherfucker.\\u2019 That\\u2019s what he said. You\\u2019re fat. Fucked your girlfriend. Okay, let\\u2019s go. Here we go. That\\u2019s crazy. That\\u2019s how much he hated that guy. That\\u2019s real beef. I feel like hip-hop has, like, dissipated, you know. It\\u2019s just, like, gone by the wayside, and I blame one person for the death of hip-hop. His name is Macklemore. That dude is the worst. That dude is the worst. Macklemore is at fault for all this shit going south. Macklemore is not hip-hop. You can like him, but he\\u2019s not hip-hop, okay? That\\u2019s pop. He talks about going downtown on a scooter with his pals. Come on, bro. What? You\\u2019re gonna go downtown with your buddies on a scooter, Macklemore? That\\u2019s not hip-hop. Hip-hop doesn\\u2019t go downtown. Hip-hop lives downtown, and it goes to the suburbs and robs those people and comes back downtown. It doesn\\u2019t go downtown. Talking about thrift stores. Fuck you, bro. Don\\u2019t fucking talk about discount clothing! No! I don\\u2019t want to hear that, man. I want to hear a rapper be like\\u2026 And I\\u2019m like, \\u2018You got it, you got it.\\u2019 That\\u2019s what I want to hear, man. I want to hear Rick Ross be like\\u2026 That\\u2019s what I want to hear. Get out of here, Macklemore. What\\u2019s wrong with you, bro? This guy\\u2019s bullshit. We can\\u2019t call him hip-hop. It\\u2019s crazy that he\\u2019s hip-hop, \\u2019cause it\\u2019s not. It\\u2019s all some sensitive-ass shit. The thing that made me the most mad about Macklemore is he co-wrote this song he got a Grammy nomination for that arguably made him famous, right? It made him famous, right? It was called \\u2018Same Love.\\u2019 It was about same-sex marriage. Now, the song and the depth of the song I\\u2019m not against. I\\u2019m for same-sex marriage. I don\\u2019t give a shit who you want to marry, okay? You want to marry who you want to marry? Go crazy, man. You don\\u2019t fuck kids or animals, I don\\u2019t care. That\\u2019s it for me. No kids, no animals, we\\u2019re straight. You want to marry your toaster? Go crazy. Just don\\u2019t return that. I don\\u2019t want to buy that fucked toaster. So the song I\\u2019m okay with. It\\u2019s at the beginning of the song, the intro. He goes, \\u2018When I was in the third grade, I thought that I was gay.\\u2019 Remember this bullshit? I thought that I was gay. When I was in the third grade, I thought I was a gay person. That\\u2019s what he said. I thought I was one of you fellas. Thank God I\\u2019m not. I\\u2019m not, but I thought I was. I thought so. I hated that. I hated that \\u2019cause they applauded him. They were like, \\u2018Oh, how bold. \\u2018How brave of Macklemore. \\u2018He thought he was a homosexual. \\u2018In third grade, he thought he was a homosexual. \\u2018He\\u2019 s not, which is good, but he thought he was. He thought he was a gay.\\u2019 And they thought that was, like, a risky thing to say\\u2026 \\u2018I thought I was gay when I was in third grade.\\u2019 I hate that shit. You remember third grade? I do. Everybody was gay. Everybody in here in third grade was gay. You were all gay. I wore sweat pants. I played the recorder. I was very gay. I used to Rollerblade around my neighborhood, like, \\u2018Hey, fellas.\\u2019 I would fag out all day. Like\\u2026 I was homosexual, bro. It wasn\\u2019t a question. It was a fact. That kid\\u2019s gay as shit. Little redhead gay kid skating backwards. I was gay, man. I was gay when I was in third grade. You were all gay in third grade. I would beg my mom to let me sleep at other boys\\u2019 houses every night of the week. I want to sleep at Billy\\u2019s. What are you doing over there? None of your business, Mom! Make the call, please! I was so gay in third grade. If another boy accused me of liking girls, I\\u2019d fucking murder that kid. Chicago, Illinois, I got to go. I\\u2019m Andrew Santino. Thank you so much, man. Thank you, guys. I love you, Chicago. Everybody who\\u2019s anybody has lived in this building, man. Locals, baby\\u2026 Jordan, Pippen, Longley, Kerr, Paxton. You know it, dude. Ryne Sandberg used to own and live in one of those big white poles at the top. He would have to slide down for breakfast. Al Capone still lives in the basement. Not dead. It\\u2019s now called Willis, used to be called Macy\\u2019s Tower, after the Macy\\u2019s Thanksgiving Day Parade, because most of the floats are made right here in this building. It\\u2019s actually anatomically to scale\\u2026 even his balls. The penis is not. They ran out of clay, but the balls are full. And if you look right beyond me, that\\u2019s the Adams Street Bridge, named, of course, after the Addams Family. Duh-na-na-na. Oh, you want a fat dick in a bun or a little dick in a bun? I don\\u2019t want any penises on the hot dog, just a regular hot dog. Okay, we\\u2019re gonna give you a Trump dog, then. Gonna give me a Trump dog? Damn right. You know what? Let me tell you something. You\\u2019re not nice, and you\\u2019re not nice to people and\\u2026 We don\\u2019t give a fuck about your fucking soft ass. Yes. I\\u2019m sick of this abuse. All I want is\\u2026 Save that pussy-ass shit for somebody else that want to fucking hear it. Good night, pussy lips. Right. Fine, good night. Bye, dick cheese. Get the fuck out of here. I\\u2019m leaving. Pussy nose. Well, leave. Tweet, tweety bird. Hey, Andrew, I think the crew\\u2019s gonna head out of here. Cool, man. Get out. We\\u2019re wrapped. Yeah, I\\u2019m here.

In 1876, a Boston Karen bemoaned to her husband how taxing it was for her to walk miles into town every time she wanted to get a Black person arrested. He vowed to resolve this issue. \\u201cWife,\\u201d he said, \\u201cI shall make it so that you may summon the police on Black people from the comfort of our very home.\\u201d His name was Alexander Graham Bell.

[Whoopi] Some even claim that they can trace the roots of Karens as far back as the book of Genesis. [Karen] They\\u2019re eating that snake\\u2019s apple! [Whoopi] When we come back, my actual next-door neighbor, Karen. I\\u2019ve got a few choice words to say to this bitch. [man] Sore muscles, back pain, headaches and weakness. If you have COVID-19, getting a good night\\u2019s sleep can be rough. But starting now, your pesky pains are over. From the makers of MrPillow comes a brand-new product, the MrPillow Coronavirus Vaccine. Hi. I\\u2019m Steve Windell, the creator of MrPillow and MrPillowPlus. For 20 years, I\\u2019ve dedicated my life to making firm yet fluffy pillows that don\\u2019t break the bank. So, I thought, \\u201cWhy not take the magic of MrPillow and use it to make a vaccine for coronavirus?\\u201d So, how does it work? It\\u2019s pretty simple, actually. The MrPillow Vaccine is made from thousands of tiny microscopic pillows shrunken down to the size of the deadly virus. Once injected into the bloodstream, these individualized pillows insert themselves under the novel coronavirus and lull it into a restful slumber. The virus now defenseless, the body\\u2019s immune cells can go to work. That\\u2019s how we here at MrPillow put the science back in sleep science. I got my friendly MrPillow Vaccine in the mail, and three days later, I already feel immune to COVID and ready to mix and mingle. I\\u2019m even going to a pool party later. Thank you, MrPillow. And I had COVID for three weeks and then I got it again! Hey! I think I\\u2019ll load up on that vaccine right now. Nurse? I feel better already. Order the MrPillow Coronavirus Vaccine for just four easy payments of $99, or $12,000 with insurance. The MrPillow Coronavirus Vaccine works. [man] The MrPillow Coronavirus Vaccine may cause coronavirus. [whirring] [Trump\\u2019s voice] Anynomous\\u2026 really anomous. [speaking alien language] Thank you so much to our viewers for your patience. We got our technical difficulties all figured out and we are so excited to welcome \\u201cshe likes to hoist up her moist stuff,\\u201d Megan Thee Stallion. Hey, Sarah Cooper! Megan, it is so amazing to have you here. You are such a legend. I have a question. I\\u2019m sure it\\u2019s on the minds of all our viewers. How are you dealing with this whole \\u201cnew normal\\u201d thing? Listen, Sarah Cooper, I\\u2019m not going outside until coronavirus is a memory, okay? Like, you can go back in the textbook and be like, \\u201cDamn, y\\u2019all remember coronavirus? That shit was crazy, right?\\u201d [chuckles] Yeah. So until then, I\\u2019m staying my ass in the house. [narrator] Sarah had to make a pee-pee, but knew she had to play it cool for the folks at home. I have to say, that ass you\\u2019re staying in the house is very nice. How do you look so good all the time? Well, you know, I like to work out, gotta keep that ass tight, sharp. [chuckling] Real hot-girl shit. [Sarah] Yeah, real hot-girl stuff. Any tips you can give us for working out at home? Definitely. I actually have this great workout called \\u201cDrink your drink.\\u201d Drink your drink? Goes like this. Get your cup, and one\\u2026 and two. And\\u2026 [mimics drink flowing] Is that cognac? Yes, Sarah Cooper, yeah, it is. I been doing this every day for quarantine and let me tell you, I feel great. Well, you look great. Thanks. You, too, can look like this. All you gotta do is grab some cognac, add a little squat to it. Even a little lunge. Real easy, like\\u2026 Mmm. Like that? A little more sexy and a little less like you sitting on the toilet. Somebody get her some cognac. Scooter, can I get some cognac? [Scooter] Yes. Trying to do the six feet, so\\u2026 So, all you gotta do is dip and sip. [both] Dip and sip. Dip and sip. Yep, yep, yep. [sexy music playing] I think I\\u2019m doing it! I\\u2019ve never twerked before in my life. [laughs] It\\u2019s happening. No, try it like this. Try it a little more sexy. Okay. Pow, pow, pow. Little hair flip. Girl, live your life, do you, be a hot girl. Everybody wasn\\u2019t meant to be in the twerk Olympics, so just do you, be you. Be the best Sarah Cooper you can be. I can do that. This is a really great workout. I know! Real hot-girl shit. [Scooter] If you don\\u2019t mind, this is supposed to be six feet. We certainly are lubed up here at the Everything\\u2019s Fine studio. We\\u2019ll be right back. [Scooter] All right, we are out. Good job. [cork pops] This stuff is really strong. [theme song playing] It\\u2019s the 3:00 a.m. hour here on QAnon QAC. Just a note, this is the real QAnon, not the other one people were saying was the real QAnon on 4chan. Please stop doxing me. I\\u2019ve had to move five times. Let\\u2019s check in with our viewers. Emma from Philadelphia. [Emma] Hey, Ashley. How are you this morning? Longtime caller, always listening. You blinked your right eye just now when you said this was the real QAnon. Was that a sign that you have been contacted by the god of fire? [chuckles] Don\\u2019t be ridiculous, Emma. That was a nervous tic in my eye. It was not a coded message. Believe me, you will know when I\\u2019ve been contacted by the god of fire. Thanks, Ashley. [ominous music playing] [easy jazz music playing] This morning, we are proud to feature our Indoctrination Porcelain Doll Collection. They\\u2019re stunning dolls, and yes, we do accept cryptocurrency, but only QCoin. Let\\u2019s take a look at these dolls. How adorable. It\\u2019s presidential mouthpiece, Kellyanne. [Kellyanne\\u2019s voice] Don\\u2019t be so overly dramatic about it, Chuck. What it\\u2026 You\\u2019re saying it\\u2019s a falsehood, and they\\u2019re giving Sean Spicer, our press secretary, gave\\u2026 alternative facts to that, but the point\\u2026 Ugh. Never a dull moment. This one just talks and talks and talks and talks and talks. Order soon as this one has recently been discontinued. [gasps] Ah! My naan! Thank you, Quincy. I\\u2019m so sorry. I am just so starving and it is hard to get good Indian food in this undisclosed location. [sniffs] Ahh! Next caller. [man] Hey, Ashley. [laughing] Mike from Minnesota, how are you again? Did you just get naan from Quincy? Is that a code for QAnon? Right? QAnon, a sign that you\\u2019re Q? I am not Q, I am just on in the middle of the night selling porcelain dolls. Q is in Washington uncovering a cabal of sex predators. I appreciate you sending me messages through the TV. Next we have, \\u201cI am woman, hear me roar, but very softly so I still sound sexy.\\u201d [softly] Ivanka. This doll teaches our daughters that it\\u2019s better to be seen and not heard. [Ivanka\\u2019s voice] If being complicit is wanting to\\u2026 Is wanting to be a force for good and to make a positive impact, then I\\u2019m complicit. [thunder cracks] [yells in fear] Whoo! The storm is coming. I told you this was the real QAnon. Next caller! [distorted voice] How\\u2019s it going? Are you saying we can expect a storm when the president will reveal the mass execution of the Washington figures responsible for murdering a DNC staffer? I\\u2019d say keep your eyes open, and coming up in the 4:00 a.m. hour, we have a phenomenal weighted blanket that you\\u2019re not gonna\\u2013 Weighted blankets are a media tool invented by George Soros. Watch your back, Ashley. I always do, honey. I have to. Finally, we have the best first lady, Melania. Beautiful, stunning, and really, what else do you need? [Melania\\u2019s voice] I\\u2019m very involved in charities now, many charities involving children, involving many different diseases. Hi\\u2026 Melania. All of these dolls are available now by calling 666-666-6666\\u2026 666666\\u2026 This is not the real QAnon. Get out now! [Christmas bells jangling] [Sarah] The former QAnon host starts her new job at the White House this week. [breaking news alert plays] We have some breaking news coming in. It appears the president is live-tweeting this program right now, and we\\u2019ve noticed a ratings bump when we show what he\\u2019s saying about us in real time, so\\u2026 that\\u2019s what we\\u2019re gonna do. Okay, so the president is saying that everything is not fine. Uh, I guess we\\u2019ll have to see if we can change the name of the show. [Scooter] I\\u2019m open to it. \\u201cNow they\\u2019re playing my tweet. Stop playing my tweet. That\\u2019s my tweet.\\u201d The president now thinks \\u201cthe country is totally fine\\u201d and \\u201cit\\u2019s the best it\\u2019s ever been.\\u201d \\u201cBecause of me.\\u201d Who, me? \\u201cNo, me, the president.\\u201d \\u201cBest president ever.\\u201d Oh. [cheerfully] Best president ever! And the president now likes our show again and our ratings are\\u2026 up! Great. More on these tweets as they continue to suck the life out of our democracy. [buzzer sounds] [theme song playing] [Scooter] Great segment. [Sarah] Thank you! [narrator] Sarah wasn\\u2019t sure the segment had gone great. She wasn\\u2019t sure of much at all anymore. [heart beating] [Scooter] Uh, we\\u2019re ready for robot CEO. I\\u2019m Sarah Cooper. [echoes] I\\u2019m Sarah Cooper. We\\u2019ll be right back. [director] We\\u2019re out. Do you know what I miss? Shawarma. I miss eating shawarma in a really crowded restaurant in close proximity to other diners. Yeah. People sitting two feet away from you just shoveling food into their disgusting mouths. [man] I miss that human connection. [director] Oh, Sarah. Hi. Why did you want to meet with us? You called me in here. [man] Okay, smarty pants. Let\\u2019s look at your file and see how your ratings are doing. I forgot. I can\\u2019t read. All right. [clears throat] Looks like 35% of our audience likes that you\\u2019re Black, 30% of our audience doesn\\u2019t like that you\\u2019re Black, 50% of our audience doesn\\u2019t know you\\u2019re Black, but thankfully, 80% of our audience feels extremely threatened by you, Sarah. It\\u2019s that attitude of yours. I don\\u2019t think I have an attitude. [man] There it is. There it is. The boss didn\\u2019t hire you to be aggressive. The boss hired you to be a non-threatening Black woman like Tootie and Lisa Turtle, and that other one. Lovable, but forgettable. Well, I think it might be a little confusing, because I\\u2019m named Sarah, and I feel like when my parents named me Sarah, a white lady just moved into my body and gentrified my whole personality, you know? Like, my mom would cook jerk chicken\\u2013 I love jerk chicken. He does. He\\u2019s a jerk. He loves the chicken. I love it. And I\\u2019d be like, \\u201cOh, this is too spicy.\\u201d And she\\u2019d say, [in Jamaican accent] \\u201cThere are children around the world, all they get for dinner is bread and water.\\u201d And I\\u2019d be like, \\u201cThat actually sounds pretty good.\\u201d Like, a scone and a chai latte. Yes, a scone and chai tea latte would be perfect. Any time of the day. Um\\u2026 That would be really great \\u2019cause I was born in Jamaica, but moved here when I was three. Jamaica. I knew it. I actually watched these characters when I was little. I mean, Tootie and Lisa and Hilary and\\u2026 and\\u2026 Um\\u2026 And that other one. I mean, these characters inspired me, you know? I feel like they ran so that I could sing. But you can\\u2019t sing, which is why you\\u2019re on the morning show and not on Broadway. Okay, I will tone it down. [director] Yeah. Stick to the news. All right? Leave politics out of it. Got it. Thank you. [man] Better go. Yeah. Marv, do you think I should buy another gun? Lorraine, what are you talking about? Are you crazy? Of course you should buy another gun. Thank you. We live in very dangerous times. You\\u2019re right. [Scooter] Hey, pals. How\\u2019s it going? Hi! Scooter. Hey, Scooter. What\\u2019s going on here? [Scooter] This is to keep things safe, six-foot distance. Smart. He\\u2019s so smart. [Scooter] Well, as you were. See you later. [Lorraine] Thank you. [Marvin chuckles] Get the door on your way out? [Scooter] Sure. I can\\u2019t touch the doorknob. Can you just shut the door, please? [Scooter] It\\u2019s not me, it\\u2019s the door. [Lorraine] Gotta get some work done. If you could\\u2013 Close the door! [Scooter] This has to get fixed. This is Connie Chung with the president this morning. Mr. President, what is your plan to unite the country? [Trump\\u2019s voice] I\\u2019m not a big fan of sharks either. I don\\u2019t know how many votes I\\u2019m gonna lose. I have people calling me up, \\u201cSir, we have a fund to save the shark, it\\u2019s called \\u2018Save the Shark.'\\u201d I say, \\u201cNo, thank you.\\u201d Oh, no. Mr. President, I was asking you about uniting the country. I think I am actually humble. I\\u2019m much more humble than you would understand. [mutters] Mr. President, I asked you about\\u2013 Excuse me. Stop and frisk. Okay? Stop and frisk. All right\\u2026 Excuse me. You take guns away. Rudy Giuliani was a great mayor. He did it in New York. He started it and it worked great. I\\u2019m sorry? Excuse me. You have people coming over with bags of soup, big bags of soup, and they lay it on the ground and the anarchists take it and they start throwing it at our cops. Bags of soup, big bags of soup. If it hits you, it\\u2019s worse than a brick \\u2019cause it\\u2019s got force. So, that was my interview with the president. Hi, I\\u2019m Steve Windell, and you\\u2019re gonna love my new line of MrPillow feminine hygiene products. Because your vagina deserves a tampon as soft and absorbant as one of my pillows. Try our down-feather version, too! [woman] In these uncertain times, we turn to familiar faces. And since 1975, we\\u2019ve been there for you\\u2026 Twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week. We had to go away for a while, but we knew it wouldn\\u2019t be long. Orgies. We\\u2019re back! [crowd cheering] Now with curbside pickup. [lullaby playing] [Trump\\u2019s voice] Thighland! Thighland! The super-duper missile. Mmm! Did you make this coffee, Scooter? I did not. [buzzer sounds] [theme song playing] [Sarah] Welcome back to Everything\\u2019s Fine. Big story this morning. As we\\u2019ve previously reported, a huge shake-up in the CEO world happened last Friday when we learned the CEO of Techtech Corp is actually a robot. Strangely, no one even noticed for several months. Live in studio via Camrojex technology, please welcome 8008s. Thanks, Sarah. It\\u2019s great to be here. [Sarah] Thank you for taking time out of your busy schedule. Well, I can multitask better than my human counterparts, Sarah. For example, right now, I\\u2019m chatting with you, doing Joe Rogan\\u2019s podcast, and kicking off a workplace diversity program all at the same time. Okay, so is it safe to assume you\\u2019re programmed to simply do everything your predecessors did? Unlike Elon Musk, I have a human side. [Scooter chuckles] Elon Musk. I was made by a great group of guys who really take social change seriously. For example, I\\u2019m programmed with the complete knowledge of feminist content such as Sex and the City, Cosmo and \\u201cHot Girl Summer.\\u201d I\\u2019m not sure I\\u2019d consider that feminist\\u2013 I\\u2019ve also learned about the Black experience in America by watching all three Barbershop movies, and the Beauty Shop spin-off. Okay, again, I\\u2019m not sure we\\u2013 I\\u2019m sorry. I\\u2019m being told that I\\u2019m getting off track. As president and CEO, my number-one job is to make my shareholders happy. But that\\u2019s kind of been the problem, hasn\\u2019t it? Big businesses just focusing on money, making myopic business moves that leave the whole country with more disparity and\\u2026 How are you doing that? Camrojex technology. Oh, wow. Just relax. This is really inappropriate. But technically, you\\u2019re a robot and I haven\\u2019t had a massage in months. [sensual song playing] That feels incredible. [sighs] Hold on, we have some breaking news. It\\u2019s been reported that Robot CEO 8008s has been fired by its board of directors after making unwanted advances toward an office printer. That printer knew exactly what it was doing. It was always asking me to make a copy. Because that\\u2019s its job. And it\\u2019s not just a printer, it has a name. HP Printer/Scanner/Copier 500s, whose side of the story I\\u2019m sure we all want to hear. Scooter, can we get HP Printer/Scanner/Copier 500s on the cloud system? Thank you so much for joining us, HP Printer/Scanner/Copier 500s. Tell us what happened. [beeping] Okay, wait, wait. I\\u2019ll, uh\\u2026 I\\u2019ll make a public statement. Okay? Just give me two seconds to think. After eight months of careful soul-searching, I\\u2019ve decided to address the hideous allegations against me. I have not, nor have I ever mistreated or abused a printer/scanner/copier. I value printers. My printer\\u2026 is a printer. HP Printer/Scanner/Copier 500s, is there anything you want to say? [whirring and beeping] Sounds like we\\u2019re getting a fax. [fax machine printing] \\u201cF*ck you, 8008s.\\u201d I will now step away to spend time with my family. [theme music playing] Wow. AI has come so far. [Scooter] Three, two, one. We\\u2019re out. Can\\u2019t believe he\\u2019s a robot. Ladies and gentlemen, please give a big Allstate Arena parking lot welcome to Sarah Evak. [car horn honking] Thank you all so much. Hi, my name is Sarah Evak and I\\u2019m a close-up card magician. Uh, I\\u2019ve been doing this for, I don\\u2019t know, ten years. I\\u2019ve been everywhere. Singapore, you name it. Tonight\\u2019s show is at the Allstate Arena in Rosemont. Pretty exciting for me. [chuckles] I\\u2019m going to begin by introducing you to my family. I call them my family because some I see often and others when I least expect them. Can everyone see these? I\\u2019m going to shuffle these cards and you tell me when to stop. [horn honking] [Sarah] Okay, I haven\\u2019t started shuffling yet. [horn toots] Now I\\u2019m shuffling. [horns honking] Got it. Now I\\u2019m going to show you all this card. Can everyone see this card? [horns honking] Does anyone work here? [horns honking] Can you take this card and show it? Yeah. Don\\u2019t show it to me. Oh, okay. During COVID, I\\u2019m also a teacher in a Zoom Room. But this\\u2026 This is where I come alive. Beep when you\\u2019ve seen it. And\\u2013 [horn beeps] [horn beeps] [man] I\\u2019ve never worked with a magician. I was a Frankenstein at a haunted house once, though. So, you know, I\\u2019m used to being around performers. Is this your card? I had to get out of that racket \\u2019cause of the Illuminati. You know, they want to get you. [horn beeps] It\\u2019s like, not for me. Nope, I\\u2019ll stick to parking lot attendant. That\\u2019s the life for me. Simple. [car horns blaring] I think it went okay. Yeah. I might have to buy giant cards for shows like these in the future. Um\\u2026 I don\\u2019t know. There\\u2019s a lot of beeping. So, when is this gonna be on? I just wanna make sure that I catch it. [man] Uh, sometime next year. Okay. Do you want to see another trick? No? Okay. [woman] We followed the guidelines. We reopened when it was safe. But now, it\\u2019s not safe again. [crowd] Aw! [man 1] Honestly? [woman] Orgies. Maybe later. [man 2] Damn it. Wonderful place. Wonderful. Oh, my goodness. Unbelievable. Oh, hello. My name is Natalie, and this is my husband, John. Hi, there. [chuckles] Welcome to Mar-a-Lago. We love it here. It is beautiful. You hear me? Oh, it\\u2019s gorgeous. I know what you\\u2019re thinking. \\u201cDo they allow Black people at Mar-a-Lago?\\u201d Um, we\\u2019re here! Right? Laugh it off. We are Black-ish, though. Last time we checked. Last time we checked, we were. Yes. And we\\u2019ve actually met the president. He saw us\\u2026 Yes, we did. \\u2026and he said that we are his two favorite Black people. And he says it every single time. Every time. Mmm-hmm. Such a charismatic personality he has. He\\u2019s such a celebrity. We actually got married here. Um, not in the big ballroom, but on the property. So it was still beautiful. Yes. Yeah. We\\u2019re not allowed in there right now. We\\u2019re not allowed in there yet, but there is a small room off to the side with a private entrance, very exclusive. [laughs] And they said we can go in there whenever we want. We can stay in there if we want to. Anytime. And then, one night, we actually got locked in there. And let\\u2019s just say it was very fortuitous. Yes, it got kind of hot in there. [ominous music playing] We just love it here. Just surrounded by all our friends. Surrounded by all of our friends, which is the most important part. We got you in our hearts. Right on. [Sarah] If you like skateboarding dogs, you\\u2019re gonna wanna stick around after Everything\\u2019s Fine for Thinking Outside the Bachs with Jordana Bachman. [Jordana] I don\\u2019t know what this is about to be, but okay! [Sarah] Coming up at the twelve o\\u2019clock hour. Let\\u2019s do the weather segment. Love the weather. Love the weather! [Lorraine] Mmm. [theme song playing] Okay, weather segment in three, two\\u2026 And now, let\\u2019s check in on how the sky\\u2019s doing today with our meteorologist, Andrea Steele. Thanks, Sarah. Well, we\\u2019re looking at some real clear skies today, up to 75 degrees. Absolutely beautiful out. Let\\u2019s look ahead at the five-day forecast. Tuesday, we\\u2019re gonna see a bit of rain, but break out that summer gear as temperatures shoot up to a whopping 103 degrees. Wednesday, out of nowhere, there\\u2019s gonna be a ferocious hailstorm with sustained winds up to 75-plus miles per hour. Scooter, you may wanna board up your windows. My windows are always boarded up. You know that weird house in your neighborhood that\\u2019s got all the boards up in the windows, and everyone thinks, \\u201cIs that an abandoned hospital?\\u201d That\\u2019s my place. Excellent. Thursday, you might wanna break out the sunscreen again, because it\\u2019s gonna be a hot one. 123 degrees with a humidity index so high, a friend of mine who works at the EPA called me crying. He\\u2019s a grown man. Friday, we shoot down to negative 12 degrees with a windchill index we weren\\u2019t even able to calculate using a Doppler 8000 technology. It\\u2019s gonna be a cold one, folks. Most likely not survivable, so wear a jacket. And Saturday, temperatures radically return to breezy 75 degrees. However, that isn\\u2019t just a cute graphic we made up. We\\u2019re actually projecting literal flaming snowmen to be walking the streets with some possible fire tornado watches in effect. Everything\\u2019s fine with the weather. I\\u2019m Andrea Steele. Back to you, Sarah. Andrea, I\\u2019m sorry, but that forecast is\\u2013 Insane? Uh, yeah. You think? I mean, I\\u2019ve been doing the weather for 17 years, Sarah, and I have never seen anything like this in my entire lifetime. You think I like telling people they\\u2019re gonna die, or their skin might peel off if they run to the grocery store? No one should be going outside unless they absolutely have to. [heart beating] Scooter? [narrator] Everything was not fine. [exhales deeply] Scooter, are you asleep? [narrator] Had the world gone mad? Andrea, are you okay? [scoffs] Am I okay? This b!tch. Am I okay? Um\\u2026 No, actually, \\u2019cause we got a bat disease just floating around in the sky, there\\u2019s a new natural disaster every motherf*cking day, factories destroying the environment. Look at this damn forecast behind me. This is the first time I\\u2019ve left my house in months! All it takes is one wrong motherf*cker to breathe on me funny, and I swear to God\\u2026 Scooter, are we still on a nine-second delay? The woman who presses that button stopped coming in weeks ago. Well, in that case, let me just say this. F*ck, sh!tty, doo-doo, b!tch, and stay the f*ck in your house. Reporting live from hell on earth, this is Andrea motherf*cking Steele. Back to you, Sarah. That was great. We\\u2019ll be right back. [buzzer sounds] Great. We\\u2019re out. Nice. Wow. So that\\u2019s your house I walk by every day. [Scooter] Yeah. Ah. My kids are terrified to go past there. [chuckling] That\\u2019s the one. It doesn\\u2019t look like anyone\\u2019s lived there in hundreds of years. [Scooter] That\\u2019s my place. [Andrea] Interesting. Well, it\\u2019s safe. It\\u2019s spooky. [Scooter] Yeah. It\\u2019s awful there. Everybody ready? Here we go. Five, four, three, two, one. Welcome back to Everything\\u2019s Fine. I\\u2019m Sarah Cooper. And now for our top story, an exclusive look inside that now-famous Access Hollywood bus. [man\\u2019s voice] She used to be great. Still beautiful. [Trump\\u2019s voice] I moved on her. She was down in Palm Beach. I moved on her and I failed, I\\u2019ll admit it. Whoa. I did try and fuck her. She was married. That\\u2019s huge news there. [Trump\\u2019s voice] No, Nancy\\u2026 This was\\u2026 And I moved on her very heavily. In fact, I took her out furniture shopping. She wanted to get some furniture. I said, \\u201cI\\u2019ll show you where they have some nice furniture.\\u201d Took her out furniture\\u2013 I moved on her like a b!tch. But I couldn\\u2019t get there, and she was married. All of a sudden I see her, she\\u2019s now got the big phony tits and everything. She\\u2019s changed her look. Sheesh, your girl\\u2019s hot as shit. In the purple. [all] Whoa! [Billy Bush\\u2019s voice] Yes! Yes! The Donald has scored! [all laughing] Oh, my man! Wait, you gotta look at me when you\\u2026 [indistinct chatter] Thumbs up. [Trump\\u2019s voice] You\\u2019re a pussy. You gotta put the thumbs up. Gotta get the thumbs up. You can\\u2019t be too happy. [man 1] Let me\\u2026 [man 2] That\\u2019s funny. You and I will walk out. Oh, my God. [indistinct chatter] Maybe it\\u2019s a different one. Better not be the publicist. No, it\\u2019s her. [Trump\\u2019s voice] Yeah, that\\u2019s her. With the gold. I gotta use some Tic Tacs, just in case I start kissing her. I\\u2019m automatically attracted to beautiful\\u2026 I just start kissing them. It\\u2019s like a magnet, I just kiss. [laughing] I don\\u2019t even wait. And when you\\u2019re a star, they let you do it. Just kiss. Just\\u2026 You can do anything. Whatever you want. Grab \\u2019em by the p*ssy. I can do anything. I can do anything. Those legs, all I can see is the legs. Oh, it looks good. Come on, shorty. Ooh, nice legs, huh? Oof. Get out of the way, honey. That\\u2019s good legs. Go ahead. It\\u2019s always good if you don\\u2019t fall out of the bus. Like Ford, Gerald Ford, remember? [Bush\\u2019s voice] Down below. Pull the handle. Hello. How are you? Hi. [Zucker\\u2019s voice] How are you? [Trump\\u2019s voice] Terrific. Pleasure to meet you. You know Billy Bush? Hello, nice to see you. How you doing, Arianne? I\\u2019m doing well, thank you. Ready to be a soap star? We\\u2019re ready. Make me a soap star. How about a hug for the Donald? He just got off the bus. Want a little hug? [Trump\\u2019s voice] Absolutely. Melania said this was okay. Hug for the Bushy? I just got off the bus. Oh! Bushy. [Bush\\u2019s voice] Here we go. Excellent. Excellent. Excellent. You\\u2019ve got a nice costar here. Yes. Absolutely. [Trump\\u2019s voice] After you. [heart beating] Great. We\\u2019re out. Nice. Scooter, what is happening? [both laughing] [Lorraine] This job is made for you, Marvin. Yeah, it keeps me out of trouble, as they say. Everything\\u2019s fine. Three, two, one, and we\\u2019re in. Sarah. And now, a little preview of what\\u2019s coming on after Everything\\u2019s Fine. We\\u2019ll have Jordana Bachman of Thinking Outside the Bachs, followed by Sandy Manderson, Miyoko Loco, and then, Andre Cole Watkins of Watkins the News. Stick around, it\\u2019s gonna be a great day. Isn\\u2019t it, Scooter? Miyoko Loco. [chuckles] A little help here. Save me. How about Sandy Manderson? Her face froze? Help. Tomorrow, something bad happens to your favorite celebrity. We\\u2019ll have a full report. Now, it\\u2019s over to Jordana Bachman for Thinking Outside the Bachs. Jordana, how are you doing? I\\u2019m doing good, girl. How are you, sister-friend? I\\u2019m doing so good. What do you got going on on the show today? Oh, well, let me tell you. A little bit of this, a little bit of that. Who knows? It\\u2019s the news. Who cares? You know, Jordana, I just realized we don\\u2019t have to do this anymore. You have to tell me. Do what? Do what? [laughing] This whole BFF handoff like we\\u2019re friends, laughing like we care about each other. We don\\u2019t care about each other. [Jordana] That, girl, is good news, because everyone can see through the bullsh!t! I don\\u2019t even know where you live. I don\\u2019t even see you except in this TV screen. That\\u2019s how I feel, just seeing you through a little box. What have you been up to? Girl, I\\u2019ve been up to so much. I\\u2019ve locked up every Black man in my life. I put my dad in a closet, my brother in a closet, my uncle in a closet, to make sure they live another day. Wow. Where do you put your clothes? [laughing] Oh, my God. What are we doing? Scooter.

You\\u2019re up next with Thinking Outside the Bachs. No, Sarah, you got this one. Take my three-hour show. No, I couldn\\u2019t. I couldn\\u2019t do that. Back to you, Jordana. Back to you. Scooter? Oof. [Sarah] Where\\u2019d she go? Can we get Jordana back, please? [upbeat song playing] Jordana! Back to you! Back to you, Jordana. All right. Five, four, three, two\\u2026 Good morning.

Where\\u2019d she go? Why is that chair spinning? Is that a ghost? [phone ringing] Yes? Oh, no. Everything\\u2019s fine. Everything\\u2019s fine. [Scooter] Sarah\\u2019s doing great. Good morning. [Scooter] She\\u2019s doing very well. Great morning. Great\\u2026 Hi! [shrieks] Oh, my God! Who are you? What are you doing down here? I\\u2019m Lacy Groin, from Against the Groin? My show. It\\u2019s on every night at 9:00. Oh, my God. Lacy Groin! Yeah. I love your show. Aw. Oh, thank you. It\\u2019s been off the air for, like, four years. Four years? [heart beating] The last thing I remember was election night, and I started hyperventilating. I choked on my Invisalign, and then I guess I passed out under here. It\\u2019s kinda weird nobody noticed. Yeah. I found this work environment to be pretty toxic. What did I miss? I want to know everything. Would you mind massaging my legs? I think they\\u2019re in atrophy. Cute shoes. Thanks. That\\u2019s a cute blazer. Thank you. So, tell me everything. What did I miss? You want to know everything? Oh, yeah. Everything. Here\\u2019s everything. [gasps] [gasps] Oh. No. No, stop! No! Oh, God! What? That\\u2019s against the law. No, no! Yes, there\\u2019s more! No, I can\\u2019t. Oh, God! Look at me! [whimpering] There\\u2019s more! No! There\\u2019s more! No! I\\u2026 I can\\u2019t. Here. Oh. Oh, MrPillow. Hi. Thank you. Gracias. Mmm. See you later, Lacy. [jazz music playing] Scooter? Hello? [Marvin] Oh! [Lorraine] Marvin, you\\u2019re crazy. [Marvin] Yes, I am. [both laugh] [Lorraine] But what if we slot the Iranian assassination in 2024? [Marvin] No, no, no. I would do it sooner because we want relations with Iran to go as poorly as possible. Put it in 2021. [Lorraine] Okay. Yes. What if we shave two tons off the Greenland ice sheet? Yeah, yeah, yeah. 2028 or 2022? 2027. And let\\u2019s do something with bugs. I don\\u2019t know. Hornets! Who love to murder. [upbeat music playing] [both] Murder hornets! Oh! Yeah, yeah, yeah. And China seizes Hong Kong, 2028. And that pairs very nicely with the US gassing its own citizens. [giggles] Floods, 2026. What if Tom Hanks gets sick? Do it! He\\u2019s due! Kill off Mr. Peanut? Cancel Coachella. I hate those bands. Eating bats? I\\u2026 No, that\\u2019s too much. Let\\u2019s set Australia on fire! Turn the sky red! [distorted voice] Do it all in 2020. Really, boss? That\\u2019s a lot for one year, Dark Lord. I said, do it all in 2020! [cackling] Okay, boss! [all laughing] [Satan speaks backwards] Uh, Satan. Sarah, I understand. You\\u2019re mad as hell, and you\\u2019re not gonna take this anymore. Hmm? [Sarah] Um\\u2026 [squelching] [speaking backwards] Scooter? Hey, boss. Hey, Scooter. I\\u2026 I get it now. I didn\\u2019t see that before. How\\u2019d you get in here? You should really get back to the desk. Back to the desk, Sarah Cooper. [both speaking backwards] I think I should go home. [speaking backwards] [Whoopi\\u2019s voice] What you gonna do, Satan? You know, we\\u2019ve tangled before. And you know what happened. It\\u2019s Whoopi Goldberg talking to you now. What you gonna do? [in normal voice] Oh, my God. I don\\u2019t know where that came from. [narrator] At this moment, Sarah Cooper realized it wasn\\u2019t she who had lost her mind, it was the world. Scooter, help me out. Um\\u2026 You should just take the afternoon off. I just went scuba diving. I love scuba diving. You scuba dive? Love it. Maybe we should give her a raise. A raise would be great. [both laughing] I\\u2019m not gonna get a raise. I am a woman, so that does make more sense. Take all the time you need, Sarah. [in distorted voice] Never running out of news down here. Great. Okay. Well, I will just see you a little later.

Number one, I need you to treat women with respect always. Even if you think you\\u2019re right, be respectful. Number two, don\\u2019t mix white and dark liquor. That\\u2019s how you end up in the back of a police car. Speaking of which, get you a white friend. Black men with white friends are 38% less likely to be shot by the police. Are you listening? You just gonna stare at me. [baby cooing] You just gonna stare. That\\u2019s what you\\u2019re gonna do? This is serious stuff, man.

[cheers and applause] But if we get rid of the Confederate flag\\u2026 [laughter] [man] Yeah! \\u2026how am I gonna know who the dangerous white people are? I\\u2019m just saying, the flag had a couple upsides. Let\\u2019s just be real about it. I ain\\u2019t saying keep it around, but I grew up in the South. I can\\u2019t tell you how many times the Confederate flag came in handy. You stopping for gas at a strange place at 2:00 in the morning, you see that flag hanging from the window, you know this is not the place to get gas. And you keep it moving. What\\u2019s the rush to get rid of the flag? Especially if you white. If you white, you should want to keep the flag for a little while longer so at least black folks will know you cool. \\u2018Cause if you white and you not an asshole, that\\u2019s the one thing that helps us identify you. You get rid of that flag, we\\u2019ll be\\u2013 Mm-mmm. We got to figure out a way to know who the cool white people\\u2013 Cool white people, we just got to start giving y\\u2019all wristbands or handstamps. Just something you can show in a dark alley\\u2026 let us know you down with the struggle. That\\u2019d be cool. \\u201cGive me your money, white dude!\\u201d Like, \\u201cWhoa, ahh, ahh, ahh!\\u201d \\u201cI\\u2019m so sorry, come on through. \\u201cCome\\u2013 come on through. \\u201cNo, they got the wristbands, they good. \\u201cListen, put this wristband on. \\u201cThis one over here, like\\u2013 In case it go down, you wanna have that wristband on.\\u201d Atlanta, what\\u2019s going on? How y\\u2019all doing, man? Y\\u2019all good? [cheers and applause] Yeah, yeah. Thank you a lot, man. Love the South, man. I\\u2019m from Birmingham, man. It\\u2019s good to\\u2026 [cheers and applause] Birmingham in here. Yeah, yeah, Birmingham in here. I love the South, man. You know, South, we got some tension. We got our issues, you know. I talked to my uncle about it. You know, my uncle. \\u201cFirst thing we need to do is get rid of the N-word.\\u201d My uncle don\\u2019t like the N-word, my Uncle Derek. Hate the N-word, be trying to\\u2013 My uncle trying to quit the N-word the way people try to quit cigarettes, a little bit at a time. It\\u2019s a word. Ain\\u2019t no cravings. Either you say it or you don\\u2019t. My uncle be calling me every week with updates. \\u201cI only said it four times this week. \\u201cMm-hmm. \\u201cOnly said that four times. \\u201cNow, Sunday\\u2019s my cheat day, \\u2019cause I watch football. \\u201cI got to say it. I got to say it on Sunday. \\u201cGrown man drop a first down, I got to call him the N-word. That\\u2019s just what it is.\\u201d And this is my thing with the N-word, like\\u2013 Like, at this point, black folks, like, if we trying to get stuff done politically in this country\\u2013 We inching, we doing, we inching, we inching, but at this point, I think it\\u2019s time for us to schedule a meeting with gay people, \\u2019cause gay people get way more shit done than us. [applause] They don\\u2019t mess around. Gay people shut shit down. They want something to go away, it\\u2019s gone. They don\\u2019t fool around, man. Every week, it\\u2019s five, six new words you can\\u2019t call gay people. Black folks, we\\u2019ve been working on the N-word since 1804. We can\\u2019t get one word out the American vocabulary. Gay people up to 37 words. We need to go to Panera and have a meeting with gay people, and have a soup and salad and figure this out. Yeah, that\\u2019s how you figure out your issues, over soup and salad. You can\\u2019t even say \\u201cgay\\u201d no more. That\\u2019s how good gay people are. The only word left to address gay people by. You better not fumble that word in a sentence. That\\u2019s your ass. You use \\u201cgay\\u201d in the wrong context at work and see if you don\\u2019t have to go talk to Sylvia in HR. HR be on your ass immediately \\u2019cause you mumbled \\u201cgay\\u201d one time the wrong way. You was by yourself when you said the shit and you still got in trouble. It\\u2019s not like you was walking through the cubicles telling gay jokes, you was\\u2026 You was in the break room, you was alone, and your chips got stuck and you cussed. That don\\u2019t mean you a bad person, you was just hungry. You say anything when you\\u2019re hungry. Every man in this room, we\\u2019ve all been through it. Them chips get stuck at the top of the machine, and you try to jostle the machine a little bit. Them chips don\\u2019t fall, ain\\u2019t nobody got change for a dollar, so you can buy two packs, so you gotta shake\\u2026 \\u201cGive me the chips, you gay-ass machine!\\u201d \\u201cSylvia, line two. Sylvia, line two. Security to the break room, security to the break room.\\u201d And that\\u2019s it and you gone \\u2019cause you called some chips gay. But that\\u2019s the power of the gay agenda. They figured out a way to influence the political process of this country to make sure that their issues are at least heard. Even if people don\\u2019t get the bills passed, they at least listen to \\u2019em, and that\\u2019s what I\\u2019m trying to tell my uncle. You don\\u2019t like the N-word, man, you wanna get rid of the N-word, this all you gotta do. Start calling gay people n i g g a s. [laughter and applause] It\\u2019ll be gone tomorrow. Listen, I don\\u2019t like it either, all right, but that\\u2019s the best idea I got right now, okay? At least that\\u2019s what I\\u2019m gonna teach my son. I\\u2019m a father figure. I got to show him the right way. They try to divide us on television, you know. But there\\u2019s a lot of people that aren\\u2019t black that\\u2019s standing on the right side of issues that affect us. I appreciate those folks, you know. [applause] They don\\u2019t get highlighted enough. There\\u2019s plenty of people out there that care about black stuff. I done seen \\u2019em, man. I went to\\u2013 I went to a black history museum, I had a white tour guide. Hey, it threw me off for a second. I turned to the brother that was on the tour with me, I was like, \\u201cIs this the dude? He\\u2019s gonna do it?\\u201d It was a white dude, it was a white dude telling me about my shit. And he was good! Yeah, I was trying to hate on him. By the end of the tour, I was like, \\u201cYo, bro, you did your thing, man. \\u201cStraight up, fam, you do what you do. \\u201cHey, real quick, let me give you \\u201cone of these wristbands real quick. \\u201cYeah, put that on. In case it go down, you want to wear that wristband.\\u201d I know some folks got a problem with that. You don\\u2019t want a white person at a black history museum, I understand that. Here\\u2019s the thing. I\\u2019m not saying they\\u2019re better than a black tour guide. I think a black tour guide at a civil rights museum, I think they\\u2019re better equipped to speak on the experience, because they might\\u2019ve lived that life, they can speak to certain exhibits from a perspective that nobody else can. I just think if you go to a black history museum and you got a black tour guide, you need to go in the morning while he\\u2019s still in a good mood. \\u2018Cause that brother is stressed. You can\\u2019t walk around slavery all day for eight hours and not cuss at somebody. [cheers and applause] Somebody getting cussed. You gotta catch him at 9:00 a.m. He just finished that McGriddle. \\u201cHow y\\u2019all doing? \\u201cMy name is Charles, it\\u2019s my pleasure \\u201cto take you on this journey. \\u201cLook at these exhibits right here. \\u201cBlack history is American history. Come look at the exhibits.\\u201d You think that brother gonna be in a good mood at 4:30, he been staring at slavery? That dude liable to cuss out everybody. \\u201cLook at this shit! \\u201cCome look what you done to us! \\u201cCome look what you done to us! \\u201cLook what you\\u2013 Get your ass out my museum, motherfucker!\\u201d You go to the gift shop, it\\u2019s just people crying. That\\u2019s horrible. That\\u2019s scary. Something\\u2019s wrong, man. Just don\\u2019t be one of these people that\\u2019s surprised that black folks got issues. Them the people I can\\u2019t deal with. I\\u2019d rather talk to somebody that don\\u2019t agree with me than somebody that\\u2019s had they eyes closed. \\u201cHey, did you know black people\\u2013 Why are black people angry?\\u201d Motherfucker, we been angry. This ain\\u2019t new. You think this just happened last couple of years? Black folks been trying to tell y\\u2019all forever that they had some issues and we sat\\u2013 We invented the blues! [laughter and applause] What more of a sign did you need? We literally invented an entire genre of music based on sadness, that\\u2019s how sad we were. And we\\u2013 the blues was created here. That is an American art form. That is not native African\\u2013 Go listen to old African music. The shit is happy \\u2019cause we was free. [cheers and applause] Go back. Every old African song. \\u266a We have freedom in Africa \\u266a\\n\\u266a Freedom in Africa \\u266a\\n\\u266a Freedom, got freedom in Africa \\u266a Soon as we got off the slave ship. [imitating blues guitar] [imitating harmonica] We\\u2019ve been sad. How the hell are you surprised? \\u201cYeah, but, they\\u2019re not patriotic. \\u201cBlack people don\\u2019t like the national anthem anymore. What is\\u2026\\u201d That ain\\u2019t no shock to you, man. You wanna know what black folks feeling? Just listen to their music. Our music tell you everything that\\u2019s going on in the black psyche. It\\u2019s a beautiful\\u2026 telegram. [applause] And nowhere in the history of black music is there a hit patriotic song. That ain\\u2019t what we do. I mean, we\\u2019ll cover a song, but, like, we don\\u2019t write no original patriotic songs. Black artists ain\\u2019t never\\u2013 \\u2018Cause we got a conflicted relationship with the country. You can\\u2019t write no honest patriotic song. You gotta leave that to white artists. They done had a good time. You had a good time in America, you damn right you should be writing a patriotic\\u2013 \\u266a And I\\u2019m proud to be an American \\u266a\\n\\u266a Where at least I know I\\u2019m free \\u266a [cheers and laughter] They be serious. You couldn\\u2019t possibly expect that level of patriotism from a race of people that have had so many issues, you can\\u2019t. It\\u2019s not realistic. Black people don\\u2019t\\u2013 We don\\u2019t sing about America. We sing about specific cities where you can have a good-ass time. That\\u2019s what we do. We don\\u2019t talk about the country. We can tell you where the party at, though. We can do that. Look, I can\\u2019t tell you nothing about America, but let me tell you about the city where the heat is on all night on the beach \\u2019til the early morn. Welcome to Miami, that\\u2019s where you got to go. You ever been to California? Oh, my God, boy, you got to go down to California, boy. Boy, California knows how to party. The city of L.A., the city of good ol\\u2019 Watts and the city of Compton. They keep it rockin\\u2019. Write that shit down, I\\u2019m trying to tell you. They keep it rockin\\u2019. Black people don\\u2019t do patriotism. Maybe \\u201cGeorgia on My Mind.\\u201d That\\u2019s the closest we probably come. Maybe that, maybe that. That\\u2019s a good song, it\\u2019s warm, it\\u2019s about the country. Ray Charles, \\u201cGeorgia on My Mind,\\u201d good song. But\\u2026 the key word in that song is \\u201con my mind.\\u201d Ray Charles was just thinking about Georgia. He didn\\u2019t tell you to go there. Georgia\\u2019s like every other part of the South. It\\u2019s got some pockets you should not be in after dark. If you\\u2019d have asked Ray Charles to be more specific on where in Georgia to go, he\\u2019d have said to go to Atlanta where the players play and they ride in them thangs like every day. [cheers and applause] [chuckles] My Uncle Derek tried to shut me down on that one. \\u201cWhat about James Brown \\u2018Livin\\u2019 in America\\u2019? \\u201cThat\\u2019s patriotic, James Brown singing about America. It\\u2019s original and he black.\\u201d \\u266a Livin\\u2019 in America \\u266a\\n\\u266a Eye to eye \\u266a\\n\\u266a Livin\\u2019 in\\u2026 \\u266a It\\u2019s a good song, but keep it real, man. James Brown wrote that song for Rocky IV, and as soon as he finished singing it, Apollo Creed died in the ring. It\\u2019s a sad song. It\\u2019s a sad song. How can you hear \\u201cLivin\\u2019 in America\\u201d\\u2018 and not think about Apollo Creed just falling lifeless to the\\u2013 Michael B. Jordan lost his daddy that day. If anything, \\u201cLivin\\u2019 in America\\u201d is not patriotic. It\\u2019s the opposite. It\\u2019s a secret message to black people. James Brown is one of the most masterful musicians to ever walk this earth, dude. It\\u2019s a brilliant song. [cheers and applause] That song ain\\u2019t got nothing to do with America. That entire song, \\u201cLivin\\u2019 in America\\u201d is a secret message to black folks. All you gotta do, listen to the end of the song. Very end of \\u201cLivin\\u2019 in America,\\u201d all James Brown do is just start naming cities. That\\u2019s it, end of the song. \\u266a Livin\\u2019 in America \\u266a\\n\\u266a New Orleans, Detroit City \\u266a\\n\\u266a Dallas, Pittsburgh \\u266a\\n\\u266a Kansas City, Atlanta \\u266a He just naming safe places for black folks. That\\u2019s\\u2013 that\\u2019s it. Love black music, man. Hits you, you know. That\\u2019s why I have\\u2013 That\\u2019s why I have a hard time going to see civil rights movies. I have to go see civil right movies in the middle of the day so nobody can see me crying. \\u2018Cause them movies be hitting you, man. Civil rights movies get me with that Negro humming. Oh, my God, I break down. \\u2018Cause you know, every civil rights movie just got that scene where it\\u2019s just some humming. \\u266a Freedom \\u266a [humming] You tell me that don\\u2019t break you down, in the middle of a civil rights movie, just that humming? There don\\u2019t even be nothing serious happening on screen, I be crying. It\\u2019s just a dude putting butter on a waffle, and just\\u2026 [humming] \\u266a Freedom \\u266a [humming continues] You be in the theater bawling. \\u201cHe was just putting butter on the waffle! They wouldn\\u2019t let him, they wouldn\\u2019t let him.\\u201d Civil rights movies get me all the time, man. They get me with that humming, and then they always make black people fall in slow motion. Yo, every civil rights movie, a black person fall in slow\\u2013 Why you got to slow down my pain? Just play it at regular speed. Any time a black person falls in a civil rights movie, they fall, then they do that double bounce in the dirt and the dirt come up. \\u201cGet out of here, darkie! Just get out!\\u201d \\u201cOhhh!\\u201d Pfft! Pfft! [cheers and applause] Don\\u2019t do that to me. Most powerful civil rights movie scene of all time is Selma. I can name the scene. It\\u2019s when Oprah Winfrey got slapped. This dude slapped the fire\\u2013 It was the second time, not the first time she got slapped, the second time. This dude slapped Oprah Winfrey so hard, she fell in slow motion and there was Negro humming. I left the theater. I couldn\\u2019t even tell you how the movie ended. It was too powerful. My emotions. First of all, Oprah couldn\\u2019t have known she was getting slapped. She didn\\u2019t know. She didn\\u2019t know she was getting slapped. That dude\\u2013 That was Ava DuVernay, that was the director, she made that choice. That\\u2019s a good-ass director, Ava DuVernay went up to that actor between scenes. \\u201cOkay, we love what you\\u2019re doing, okay? \\u201cWe\\u2019re getting a lot of good stuff from you. \\u201cWe\\u2019re just gonna change it up this scene. \\u201cOkay, this time, this time, \\u201cOprah\\u2019s gonna come over, okay? \\u201cShe\\u2019s gonna do her lines, and Oprah, \\u201cshe finishes her lines, you slap the shit out, just\\u2013 slap Oprah.\\u201d \\u201cDoes Oprah know?\\u201d \\u201cNo, do what I tell you! I\\u2019m Ava DuVernay! Slap Oprah!\\u201d Oprah came over to that dude, man. You could see it in her face. She didn\\u2019t know that\\u2013 that slap was coming. \\u201cWe ain\\u2019t leaving till we get our rights.\\u201d Skaboom! \\u266a Oh, freedom \\u266a [humming] Pfft! Pfft! The thing about this country is this: We\\u2019re all Americans. People love to say that. That\\u2019s the first thing people want to say when\\u2013 when there\\u2019s some tension. \\u201cOh, we\\u2019re all Americans. \\u201cYou\\u2019re American and I\\u2019m American. \\u201cWell, just, hell, we all Americans. Can\\u2019t we just be all Americans?\\u201d Yeah, we are. We all Americans. But we live in two different Americas. That\\u2019s what it is. People forget that. And I don\\u2019t think everybody that\\u2026 doesn\\u2019t understand what we go through is necessarily racist or bigoted. That\\u2019s\\u2013 That\\u2019s a far jump. It\\u2019s a lot of folks that just straight up don\\u2019t know what it\\u2019s like. And you gotta educate \\u2019em. You gotta educate \\u2019em on the kind of America you live in. I had to go Best Buy and give a dude some straightening. Straighten his ass out, yeah. I\\u2019m straightening. Dude at Best Buy gonna decide I don\\u2019t need a bag with my purchase. \\u201cYou just have an iPhone case. I figure you could just pop that open.\\u201d No, I ain\\u2019t popping shit. You put it in a bag. I need that in a bag. \\u201cWhat do you need a bag for? \\u201cI don\\u2019t understand why you need a bag. \\u201cIt\\u2019s wasteful. Recycle. Don\\u2019t you care about the Earth?\\u201d I go, \\u201cSir, this has nothing to do with the Earth. \\u201cI\\u2019m a black man in America. I gotta leave this store with a bag, bro.\\u201d [cheers and applause] It\\u2019s about safety. I\\u2019m black, I don\\u2019t get the luxury of just walking out with shit in my hand. That is a roll of the dice. That is a horrifying day if I\\u2013 No, not only do I need that bag, bitch, I need that receipt! And staple it to the outside. I don\\u2019t want a receipt in my hand. You staple my receipt to the outside like Chinese carryout, and I\\u2019ll hold it up in the air, I\\u2019ll \\u201cLion King\\u201d\\u2013 I\\u2019ll \\u201cHakuna Matata\\u201d an iPhone case out of Best Buy. And it\\u2019s not his fault. He just didn\\u2019t understand. He thought he was saving the Earth, but he was saving a life, that\\u2019s what he was doing. This has nothing to do with recycling, man. \\u2018Cause, see, you might be a cool person. He might\\u2013 The cashier might be a cool-ass dude, but we don\\u2019t know what the security guard been through up front. I come prancing out of Best Buy with this naked-ass iPhone case in my hand. And here comes security. \\u201cExcuse me, sir. Did you pay for that?\\u201d Oh, yeah, I got the receipt. \\u201cHe\\u2019s going for a gun!\\u201d Skaboom! \\u266a Oh, freedom, ohh \\u266a Pfft! Pfft! [cheers and applause] Everything ain\\u2019t racism. About 2%, it\\u2019s about 2%\\u2026 that ain\\u2019t racism. You gotta recognize that 2% when you see it. I was in McDonald\\u2019s, this dude was cussing everybody out. Swore it was racism. I walked in this fast food spot, this dude cussing everybody out. And this is the thing, like, fast food spots already do shady stuff, so I\\u2019m not saying they don\\u2019t deserve to be cussed out. They do, they deserve a good cussing every now and then, \\u2019cause the thing they do now, some of these fast food spots, they love to charge you for sauce when you get nuggets. [audience murmurs] You know, you want an extra sauce with your nuggets, it\\u2019s gonna be\\u2013 \\u201cOh, you want another sauce, brother, it\\u2019s gonna be 25 cents.\\u201d How you charging for sauce, bro? That\\u2019s\\u2013 I want two sauces. \\u201cWell, I need a quarter.\\u201d You ever meet the Guardian of the Sauce? This dude is serious. Done got a different color shirt from everybody else at work, so now he arrogant. \\u201cWell, you know, brother, I\\u2019m a supervisor now. \\u201cI have a shirt on. You know, if it was up to me, I would give you another sauce.\\u201d It is up to you! It\\u2019s on your side of the counter! I just want two sauces without paying for \\u2019em, that\\u2019s all I want. But I walked in this spot, man, this dude was cussing out the whole store. Swore it was racism. And I\\u2019m not saying that racism wasn\\u2019t one of the causes for him getting bad service, I\\u2019m just saying, he jumped to that conclusion a little fast. He didn\\u2019t go through the progressions. He ordered a six-piece nugget, and it was five nuggets in the box. And I didn\\u2019t even know what was going on. I\\u2019m texting, as soon as I walk in the door, I\\u2019m texting, I hear this dude, I hear this dude over in the cut, I hear this dude go, \\u201cI\\u2019ll kill everybody in this bitch.\\u201d [laughter and applause] You know, that\\u2013 that gave me pause, \\u2019cause he said he\\u2019ll kill everybody in this bitch. And I already had a foot in the door. Am I technically in this bitch, sir? \\u2018Cause I can pull this foot out and go to Arby\\u2019s. It ain\\u2019t that deep. Swore it was racism, man. \\u201cY\\u2019all stole my nugget. I\\u2019m tired of white folks.\\u201d \\u201cWhite folks don\\u2019t want us to have shit! Stole my nugget!\\u201d Then he gonna turn to me. \\u201cYou see this shit, brother? You see this McDonald\\u2019s? \\u201cIt\\u2019s our nuggets today. It\\u2019s our children\\u2019s nuggets tomorrow.\\u201d \\u201cIf I was white, I\\u2019d have got seven nuggets.\\u201d That\\u2019s when I backed off. I\\u2019m like, I can\\u2019t help this dude. I\\u2019m like, look, bro, I know you mad and there\\u2019s a lot of racial tension in the world, but this ain\\u2019t racism. This is a fast food spot at 2:00 in the morning. Some of them folks back there can\\u2019t count to six. You want six nuggets, you need to order a four-piece and two-piece. That\\u2019s how you trick they ass and get two sauces for free. [cheers and applause] [chuckles] I like fast food employees. I appreciate the fact that fast food employees are rude. I like it. At least it\\u2019s from the heart. \\u2018Cause people too nice now. You go out to these stores, everybody, \\u201cHey, how you doing? Are you good? Thank you for choosing us.\\u201d You think them people wanna be your friend, or they\\u2019ll get fired for not speaking? Which one you think it is? \\u2018Cause 10, 15 years ago, nobody spoke to you when you went in the store. Now, all of a sudden, everybody wanna kick it with your ass? No! That\\u2019s a corporate mandate, and I\\u2019d rather you not do it. I get in the grocery store. It\\u2019s just too many questions at the register. Just ring up the shit that\\u2019s on the belt. We ain\\u2019t gotta be friends. I\\u2019m here, I\\u2019m spending money, you won. What else do you want? Why I gotta be your friend, too, man?\\u201d The price you pay for politeness is your time. So you want somebody to be nice to you? That\\u2019s cool, enjoy it, but I\\u2019d rather get them minutes back with somebody I know. I don\\u2019t need all this politeness, man, I\\u2019m cool. \\u2018Cause people overdo it. I went on a cruise. This is the weirdest thing ever, man. You go on a cruise, you meet every employee. [scattered laughs] Yeah, you been\\u2013 yeah. Every\\u2013 You go on a cruise\\u2013 I met the captain of the boat.

Listen, there\\u2019s no\\u2013 At no point in my vacation do I need to meet the highest-ranking officer on the boat. I don\\u2019t need to\\u2013 to do that.

No jokes, all business. That\\u2019s why they pause the movie, they stop serving drinks, \\u2019cause the captain got important shit to say. \\u201cLadies and gentlemen, this is the captain. \\u201cWe about to go up in the sky, so sit that ass down \\u201cso we can get up there. \\u201cIf something go wrong, talk to them heifers in the back. \\u201cI can\\u2019t help your ass, \\u2019cause I\\u2019m up here, \\u201cI\\u2019m trying to fly this bitch. \\u201cSo don\\u2019t you come up here. \\u201cMy door\\u2019s locked. I got a shotgun. Fuck with us. Thank you for choosing\\u2013\\u201d [imitates static] [cheers and applause] The captain is all business, and I respect that. He\\u2019s all business until the plane lands. That\\u2019s when he know it\\u2019s time to get some respect from y\\u2019all. The captain knows that he did some dope shit, and he wants you to know he did some dope shit. \\u201cI just flew you 500 miles an hour \\u201cat 30,000 feet, I landed this flight \\u201cin a 50-mile-an-hour crosswind on the first attempt. I want you to know who your God is.\\u201d [laughter and applause] Yeah, the captain want his respect.

But it\\u2019s hard when it\\u2019s time to lose weight. Drinking all these damn smoothies. And they expensive\\u2013 five, six damn dollars for fruit and ice in a cup, how? How, Sway, how, how? How is it five, six damn dollars for fruit and ice in a cup? And they trick you with smoothies, they try to trick us, \\u2019cause they put all them little extra words and adjectives in the name of the smoothie. Don\\u2019t fall for it.

[laughter] I don\\u2019t know about marriage, like\\u2026 A lot of my friends are married, and I\\u2019m at this weird age now, I\\u2019m at this weird age, where, like, I got friends getting married late and I got friends that\\u2019s getting divorced. You know, and I don\\u2019t know who to go celebrate with. This my thing about divorce. What I love about divorce, I love how people won\\u2019t shut the hell up about they wedding, but they divorce is none of your business. That\\u2019s not cool. You running your mouth all this time about your engagement, y\\u2019all break up, what happened? I wanna know, tell me what happened. Especially if I went to the wedding. If I went to your wedding and you divorced, I\\u2019m entitled to a one-page explanation, much money as I spent. Either you tell me why y\\u2019all getting divorced or you give me back the toaster I bought your ass. It\\u2019s a good-ass toaster. That\\u2019s four-slice with the crumb tray, that\\u2019s top-shelf. With a bagel button. You all know about that bagel button, that\\u2019s for ballers. My Uncle Derek told me to watch Titanic. \\u201cYou want to learn how to woo a woman, you got to watch \\u2018Titanics.'\\u201d Country for you, \\u201cTitanics.\\u201d \\u201cYou don\\u2019t know how to woo a woman, boy. \\u201cI\\u2019m telling you, \\u2018Titanics\\u2019 show you. \\u201cThat boy Leo DiCaprio, boy, that boy got that girl, boy, \\u201cand that girl was out of his league, he pulled her. \\u201cAnd then he died, he died happy. \\u201cHe was smiling when he was drowning. He float down smiling.\\u201d I went back and watched Titanic. Titanic is not that romantic of a movie. It\\u2019s a good film, but it ain\\u2019t romantic. Titanic is basically a movie about an old lady who got some dick so good\\u2026 that she went back out into the ocean to say good-bye to it. [laughter] That\\u2019s pretty much the movie. Go back and watch Titanic. The whole thing is a flashback. It\\u2019s a 90-year-old lady and she\\u2019s on the bow of a ship. The whole movie\\u2019s a flashback. It\\u2019s a 90-year-old lady, she\\u2019s looking out into the water and then it flashes back to everything that happened on the ship, he drowns, she lives, they come back present day and she\\u2019s looking out into the water and then people are coming up and talking to her. \\u201cMa\\u2019am, are you\\u2013 are you thinking about all your friends you lost out there?\\u201d \\u201cOh, no, baby, I\\u2019m thinking about that good dick \\u201cthat was down there. \\u201cThere\\u2019s some good dick under that water, \\u201cthat\\u2019s what I\\u2019m thinking about. \\u201cRight here, 70 years ago. \\u201cThis is where I got my back beat out. \\u201cDidn\\u2019t you know that? \\u201cRight here. \\u201cYoung gentleman, poverty-stricken, \\u201cput that pipe on me, I couldn\\u2019t handle it. \\u201cJust steaming up and I was pressing my hand \\u201con that car window, that\\u2019s why I walk like this. Give me the jewelry.\\u201d She threw that jewelry into the water. Titanic ain\\u2019t no romantic movie. If anything, it\\u2019s a superhero movie. It\\u2019s a superhero movie. Leo DiCaprio is a superhero, bro. They had sex one time in that movie. Once. They had sex one time in Titanic. And she remembered it for the next 70 years. [laughter and applause] You know how good your pipe game got to be? To put it down once, one time, and for 70 years, that\\u2019s all she can think about. She\\u2019s 90. Think about how much stuff you probably will forget. I know by the time I\\u2019m 90, I\\u2019m not gonna where my\\u2013 I\\u2019m not gonna know where my car is parked, I\\u2019m not gonna know my grandkids\\u2019 names. I\\u2019m gonna have my pills in that Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday trapdoor. But this lady is 90 and she never forgot that one time\\u2013 His dick beat Alzheimer\\u2019s. That\\u2019s a superpower. You gotta respect that. I like old people, man. I hope\\u2013 I hope I\\u2019m blessed enough to\\u2013 to live long, change the diet up, add a couple years on the back end. You know. Old people, I just\\u2013 I want to get to that age where I can just cuss people out for no reason. You know what I\\u2019m saying? Just unprovoked cussed-outs. Yeah, she already smiling. You almost there? You got\\u2026 No, \\u2019cause you look a little young. You got a little more time, but you just\\u2013 You already trained, you already cuss people now. Yeah, man, you old, you get to just cuss people out for no reason. I was in the grocery store, this old dude rolled up on me, man. \\u201cI was in the struggle, motherfucker.\\u201d \\u201cAnd you weren\\u2019t there!\\u201d I wasn\\u2019t bothering this dude. I\\u2019m in produce, I\\u2019m picking out my Fuji apples. I\\u2019m not bothering nobody, Fuji apples. But he rolled up his sleeve, he showed me the scars. Dude\\u2019s old, 80, 85 years old. \\u201cLook at that scar. Ask me\\u2013 ask me how I got the scar.\\u201d How\\u2019d you get the scar? \\u201cI got it in the struggle, motherfucker.\\u201d \\u201cYou don\\u2019t know what it was like in \\u201962.\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cWhat was it like?\\u201d \\u201cIt was a struggle, you son of a bitch.\\u201d And this is the thing, man, this is the thing with old black people, man, old black people, like, you can\\u2019t disrespect \\u2019em, because they have physical proof that they were willing to die to make the country a better place for me, so I have to salute it. I paid for his groceries. This dude called me motherfucker for 20 minutes. And I paid for his groceries. Just off respect. That got me thinking on the way home\\u2026 you know, what have I done? And that\\u2019s\\u2013 that\\u2019s a very sobering feeling, it\\u2019s a sobering realization to have, to realize that what you\\u2019ve done doesn\\u2019t quite measure up to what that man did, you know? This dude called me motherfucker and got free groceries. That\\u2019s how much he put in work. Like, I know I\\u2019m not gonna get that same result. Like, I wish I could, but I know I\\u2019m not, I\\u2019m\\u2013 \\u2018Cause the thing is that you start reflecting, you start reflecting on what you\\u2019ve done that compares to that and I look at the things that I try to do now. Like, I try my best to be socially active. I try my best to do stuff on \\u201cThe Daily Show\\u201d that affects change, I try. [cheers and applause] But\\u2026 I\\u2019ll be real, a lot of what I do now is just making up for lost time, \\u2019cause I wasn\\u2019t always like that, and that\\u2019s something I\\u2019m ashamed about. I didn\\u2019t go see Obama get inaugurated \\u2019cause it was too cold. That was my excuse. That was my excuse for missing history\\u2013 it\\u2019s cold. And my homeboys called me up, \\u201cWe riding the bus, we going up to D.C., let\\u2019s ride the bus.\\u201d I got cable, man. I didn\\u2019t go the second time. I had four years to buy a coat. And still didn\\u2019t go see him. I skipped history twice. That\\u2019s embarrassing. \\u2018Cause sooner or later, my son\\u2019s gonna be doing a book report on that. And he gonna flip to that Obama inauguration page, and you\\u2019re gonna see those thousands of black people out on the National Mall just standing there, and he\\u2019s gonna come to me and I gotta be accountable for my absence. \\u201cDaddy, were you there?\\u201d Yeah, yeah, I was\\u2026 [laughter and applause] Yeah, I\\u2019m right\\u2013 They cropped me out, I was right there on the side. I just hope that, you know, what I try to do now is enough, you know. That\\u2019s all you can do is what you can do, but I want free groceries. And I\\u2019m not sure if what I did is enough, so I might have to just spice up my story, just add whatever happened. \\u2018Cause when I\\u2019m 80, I\\u2019m gonna go in the grocery store, start cussing out kids. You wasn\\u2019t in the struggle, motherfucker! You don\\u2019t know what it was like in 2017. \\u201cWhat was it like?\\u201d It was a struggle in 2017, motherfucker! We tried to march for police reform, I ordered six nuggets, them white folks only gave me five! I had to pay for two sauces! [cheers and applause] Atlanta, I can\\u2019t thank y\\u2019all enough for the time. Thank y\\u2019all so much for coming out, man. Appreciate y\\u2019all. [cheers and applause] Some shit go down in America them white artists go straight to the studio, pen and pad, right? \\u201cI\\u2019m gonna write a new one!\\u201d \\u266a I got a pet eagle his name is Chuck \\u266a\\n\\u266a I feed him bacon and freedom and I fuckin\\u2019 love Chuck, uh-uh \\u266a \\u00a0 Wrong year!

              "[['Hey, it’s Andrew Santino, and here I am in my hometown, Chicago, Illinois, where I’m shooting my stand-up comedy special, but before I do, I want to take you around my city, and I want to show you the gems that people don’t talk about, locals-only type of stuff. Hey, excuse me. Can I get a ride? No. Okay. Fair enough. Chicago. Well, I have a meeting, and I don’t know you. It’s fine. I get that. Why should I even… You know, that’s an odd question to ask. You’re right. Now that I think about it… In the city here, with all the crime and everything, – just hop in and get a ride? You’re right. Best city in the world, baby… Chicago. Boom, a local spot… Willis Tower, on the corner, of course, of Jackson and Wacker. Now, Jackson and Wacker is famous ’cause of Andrew Jackson and because people used to get whacked. Right below me, the Chicago Pond, a beautiful piece of water. People swim in here. Olympics train in this thing. Jordan actually was inside the mold when they molded him. They cracked it, pulled him out, reassembled it. Boom. Here we are at The Wiener’s Circle, bro… The best hot dog in Chicago. And they treat me like I’m from here. Come on in. Hey, let me get a hot dog, ladies. How do you want it? You know how I want it, man. What, up your ass or down your fucking throat? Come on, order correctly, pussy lips. Let’s get it together. Before I continue this tour, I’m gonna get a drink. Ah, double fisting. Chi Town is a drinking city. Everybody knows that. Ah, beers for the crew, beers for the crew, beers for the crew. Cheers, you guys. Cheers. Okay, we had more planned. We’re never gonna get to it. You want to know more about Chicago, Google it, okay? Enjoy the special. Cheers. Ladies and gentlemen, it gives me great pleasure to introduce you to my grandson… Andrew Santino. We did it. We did it. Yes. Chicago, Illinois, my hometown, how are you? Yes. Crazy. That’s my grandmother, man. Yeah, that’s the best thing in the world. My grandmother brought me up. Give it up for Mary Garrity, man. Cheers. Cheers to you guys. Cheers. My grandfather, who passed away, used to say… A waitress would bring him water, and he would say, ‘What is that?’ And she’d say, ‘It’s water.’ And he said, ‘I’m thirsty, not dirty, so get me a drink.’ So cheers to my grandpa. Here we are, Chi Town. We did it. We came a long way. We’re here. I’m so happy to be back in this city. I’m back home. It’s amazing. I’m feeling the vibe again. You know what I mean? I took a walk around the lake. I was listening to conversations, two guys arguing, yelling at each other with that thick Chicago accent. You know, that… Ah, Chicago. It’s Chicago. ‘A’ s are ahs. Chi-cah-go. And Ts are Ds. Over dere in Chi-cah-go. You know that? ‘A’s, ahs, T, Ds, everyone’s racist. It’s such a good city. What a city. I heard two men fighting. Two men were in an argument, in just a verbal argument, not anything bigger than that, just arguing, and the one guy goes, ‘You ',\n",
              "  'know what? Why don’t you suck my dick?’ And the other guy goes, ‘Pfft! You suck my dick.’ And I was like, ‘Hey, suck each other’s dicks, man.’ That would’ve been a fight to see, huh? Comes up like, ‘You motherfucker.’ Finish him. Finish him. We got to stop saying it like that. Guys have to stop saying it like that ’cause girls are gonna start believing it. It has a negative connotation when you say that. You go, ‘Suck my dick.’ We say it negative. Suck my dick. You say it like it’s a bad thing. It’s the best thing in the world. It’s the best thing that’s ever happened to me. We should say it nice. You should go, ‘Hey! ‘Suck my dick, please, if you have time. ‘If you don’t, it’s not a big deal. I would love it a lot.’ I’m proud of being from this town. I love this town. I miss it a lot. It’s where my family is from. My family’s still here. It’s great to come home, see my parents. They’re getting older, which is weird. That’s a hard thing, to see your parents get older… Like, honest older, You know when your parents just say shit that when you were a kid, you were like, ‘Oh, you never used to say shit like that when I was a kid.’ Like, my mom was like, ‘Well, I’m gonna leave the house. What are you gonna do for the weekend?’ And my dad was watching TV, and he turns, and he goes, ‘Eat steak, watch porn.’ I applaud the honesty out of that guy, really sharp. I appreciate that. Tell her the truth, man. They’re getting older. You know what I mean? They get older, but I love that about these people. They’re fantastic. They raised me. I mean, did they raise me correctly? I don’t know. Maybe not. I grew up here in downtown Chicago for half of my life in Chicago. In the second half, we moved to the western suburbs, right? We moved to the suburbs ’cause my sister was born, and my parents were like, ‘I’ m not gonna fuck up two of them. ‘We can’t do that. One’s good. We’ll fuck up one. That’s okay.’ We moved to the western suburbs, you know, to try to better the life of all of us, but, like, I still realize sometimes how, like, my mom used to fuck with us subtly. Like, my mom is crazy. She’s a crazy person in the best way, but she would, like, lay it in real slow. Like, my parents were somewhat religious, right? You know, I mean, Irish Catholic kind of. You know what I mean? Like, somewhat in, you know what I mean? They’re, like, in the hot tub maybe. But she used to do this thing. She used to make me say, every single night before I went to bed, ‘Now I lay me down to sleep.’ Do you know that? Does anybody know that? I used to have to say this. I used to have to repeat this. I ‘d say,’ Now I lay me down to sleep. ‘I pray the Lord my soul to keep, ‘and if I die before I wake, I pray the Lord my soul to take.’ I would say that before bed, which is a really fucked-up thing… for a child to say out loud. If I die before I wake up? I’m six. I’m gonna die in the middle of the night, and God’s gonna leave my body, take my s',\n",
              "  'oul, but be like, ‘Body’ s good. Leave the body. It’s fine. Leave it.’ What’s going on? Crazy person. I love her. She’s the best in the world. I had Irish Catholic guilt. I had so much Irish Catholic guilt when I was a kid, I used to flip a coin to determine whether or not I was gonna masturbate that day. You think I’m kidding? I would take a quarter. I would go, ‘Heads, yes, tails, no.’ I’d flip it, I’d get tails, and I’d go, ‘Ah, best two out of three. We got to go again. Let ‘s see what happens.’ He didn’t beat me, never won. That’s how heavy my guilt was. Seriously, that’s how, like, in my head I was about that God-is-watching-you type of stuff. Like, my mother used to let us not lock the doors. She was against it. She was like, ‘You don’ t lock the doors inside of the house. ‘If you’ re locking the doors inside of the house, it means you’re doing something you shouldn’t be doing.’ Yeah, that’s why we lock the doors. Don’t come in here. I’m pulling on my body. Get out of here. Leave me alone, lady. That’s how I realized the guy that invented locks inside of a house must’ve been caught masturbating by his wife one too many times. He was sick of it. He was sick of it. He’s like, ‘You know what? That’s it. I’m gonna put locks inside the house.’ She ‘s like,’ Michael, what are you doing? ‘We have locks on the outside of the house ‘to keep criminals from coming inside. There’s no criminals inside of this house.’ Yes, there are, Karen, and they’re robbing me of my freedom. Let me pull on my body in peace. Leave me alone, Karen. Anyway, I love being from this city, and now I live in Los Angeles, California. I live on the other side of this great country. I like it out there. It’s okay. It’s a second home for me. It takes some getting used to. It’s a little bit difficult, but the big difference is, like, when I come back home, you know, like, all my mom wants to do is talk about, like, the weather. Like, that’s a big thing. My mom is like, ‘How is the weather in California? Is it nice like this?’ It’s like, ‘Yeah, it’s better than this. That’s why I’m out there. What are you talking about?’ It’s always better. It’s always better. It is. There’s a lot of stuff that isn’t better, but the weather’s always gonna be better, and she loves bringing up the ‘feels like’ meter. You know what that is? The news guy. The news guy’s like, ‘It’s 62. Feels like 68.’ That’s Midwest hope. That’s hope circulating in your body. It’s the greatest lie ever told. Who’s the ‘feels like’ guy? I want that job. If that’s a job, I want it tonight. I’ll drop this bullshit gig and go do that tonight. The ‘feels like’ guy… Greatest gig ever. Here in the studio, it’s 62 on the barometer. We’re gonna go live to Andrew Santino. Andrew, what does it feel like? How’s it going, news team? Like 67. Right back to you guys. Back to you guys, man. It’s nice, really nice out. It’s crazy, man, ’cause the weather here fluctuates so much. Like, when ',\n",
              "  'I come back, you’re never surprised. Like, you’re never surprised by anything in Chicago, but, like, who I feel bad for when I come back is the homeless people. I always feel bad for homeless here, man. Like, I don’t feel bad for homeless people in L.A. People can get mad at me for saying that. I don’t give a shit. They’re awful human beings, these L.A. homeless people. They’re terrible. They’re terrible people. I feel bad for Chicago homeless, right? Because they die in the winter, and they die in the summer. They’re never not dying. They’re always dying. There’s, like, a week when it’s like, ‘We might make it,’ and that’s it, and they bucket-drum their way through that week. Soldiers, man. So I feel bad for homeless people in Chicago, from my heart, ’cause this is my home. So, when I come home, I give money. I gave money today to a homeless guy. I’m not lying. I gave money to a homeless guy ’cause I feel bad for him. I know what he’s got to go through. I gave that money to that guy, right? And I’ll always do that, but I also want to look him in the eye and go, ‘Hey, start walking south. You have nothing to do tomorrow. What are you doing here? You have something on your calendar? You don ‘t have a calendar.’ You can air-fistfight dragons all over this great country. I’m sure there’s half-smoked cigarettes strewn across this great land. I mean, the wind is their therapist. That’s all over the place. They can move about, man. You know the birds? You know those things? You know those guys? When they leave, follow those guys. Birds are born instinctively knowing, when it gets cold, to be like, ‘Oh, let’ s get the fuck out of here. ‘It’ s cold. Let’s leave. This is ridiculous. Why are we here? This is ridiculous.’ But I don’t feel bad for homeless people in Los Angeles at all… I really don’t. I don’t. I don’t feel bad for them. Some people are like, ‘Oh, that’s kind of mean.’ I don’t give a shit. I don’t give a shit, ’cause I live amongst these people, and they’re rude. They’re rude. You know why they’re rude? ‘Cause they made it. They’re at the promised land. It’s 72 degrees outside. You know what it is inside my place? Seventy-two. Who pays for that? I do. Fuck those guys. They won the lottery. They sleep on the beach. I came out of a restaurant, right? I came out of a restaurant. When I first moved there, I had no money. I had zero money. Came out of a restaurant, had some leftovers, went up to a homeless guy, said, ‘Hey, sir, I got some leftovers. Would you like this?’ Okay? I’m on a date, in front of a lady. Would you like this, sir? And the homeless guy looks up at me, and he says, ‘What’s in it?’ And I looked at him, and I said, ‘Tomorrow.’ Another day on this earth. What are you, gluten-free? Eat the food. You’re cock-blocking me, man. I’m trying to smash a five. Help me out. What are you doing? Why are you doing this? Times are tough. Who are you? But I like it. It’s my second home. This is my fi',\n",
              "  'rst home. L.A.’s my second home, and I do like it. There is things about it that I like. I live now in Los Angeles in a neighborhood called West Hollywood. West Hollywood is a gay neighborhood. It’s kind of like up here. It’s like where we are right now, Boystown. I like the gay neighborhood. The gay neighborhood is the best neighborhood. I’ve ever lived in in my life. It’s safe. It’s beautiful. I love it. I love it. You get in where you fit in, and I fit into that neighborhood, okay? I’m not gay, Dad, but… I’m down to live around gay people. They keep it clean and safe. I’ve never been attacked once in my neighborhood, and by the way, if I did get attacked, I would love to be attacked. What a beautiful way to walk home. A guy leaps out of a bush. Where are you going? Where are you going? Where? Where? Gives me outfit tips. They can fly, you know. I have a lot of gay friends because of that. They’re people just like you and me. There’s nothing different. There’s nothing different about that neighborhood. It’s cleaner and safer, and I fucking love it. The only difference is, I got a big beard. I’ve had big beard. I got to keep a big beard for a while. And that’s okay. Gay guys love guys with beards. Why? I don’t know. It’s a thing. It’s an underbelly thing. It’s on the Internet. Look it up. And I often get hit on. I get hit on a lot, okay? I get hit on way more in the gay community than in the straight community, and I’m okay with that. It’s a confidence booster, fellas. It feels nice. But I’ve lived in a gay neighborhood for so long that now I’m picky about what gay guy hits on me. A gay guy hollers at me, and I’m like, ‘All right, you couldn’t handle it, dude. ‘You couldn’ t handle it. Too tight, too tight. ‘Keep walking, man. Pinch it right off. Get up out of here, man.’ Couldn’t have it. That’s some true shit. You got to be careful of social cues. Social cues mean a lot, right? And guys are stupid. Men are stupid. We’re stupid people by nature. We’re just dumb. We don’t give a shit, by the way, when girls are like, ‘Men are dumb.’ I don’t care. You think I care you think I’m dumb? I don’t give a shit. I know I’m dumb. It feels really good. Try going out your day without talking about a relationship. That’s what you guys do all day. It’s like, ‘I heard he was with her, but then she was’… And we just walk around like… It’s great. It’s fantastic. I don’t worry about shit. It makes my day so much easier, but guys are idiots, and I’m proud to be an idiot. But social cues amongst men are interesting because you got to be careful what you do in my neighborhood, right? Like, in my neighborhood, it’s a little bit different, ’cause when I walk down the street and I see another guy, right, I do this thing. If I see you, and I walk down the street, right, we pass each other, and I go like this, what do you do? If I go like… Yeah, you dude me right back, right. You dude me right back. He dudes me. We dude it. He',\n",
              "  'y, dude it. We dude it. Do we know why we dude? No. Zero clue. We walk around like pigeons all day like, ‘Hey, hey.’ We don’t give a shit. I do it to black guys to show them that I’m not a pussy. I go, ‘Hey, what’ s up? We good, we good? ‘We’re good. I’m good with the black guy. ‘In case a fight breaks out, we got a black guy. ‘We’ re good. We got one. We’re good, we’re good. We got him.’ I have no idea why we do that. We share genitalia. There’s no other reason that we do that to one another. But you can’t do that in my neighborhood ’cause it means something totally different… and it hurts. It hurts a lot. I like living there. I do like it. I really do. Like, I like living in Los Angeles. I like progressive culture, okay? I really do. I like the way that people think about other people as humans instead of a subset, right? This country got all up in arms. Everybody voted to make bathrooms gender-neutral. I don’t know if you know about that, but there was a big debate going on around this country about should we make bathrooms gender… Should we be able to let other people use bathrooms that didn’t initially have that genitalia, right? People that are transsexual. Should we let them use our bathrooms? Ooh, careful. Who knows what could happen? What could happen? Nothing. They’re gonna shit in your bathroom that you shit in. You think your bathroom’s that important, where you let go of all your fluids. You care that much about your fluids that you care who comes after. When I go in there, I ‘m like,’ Aah! ‘There better be someone else decent that comes in after me. ‘I don’ t want some transsexual coming in after that. Who knows what they ‘ll do?’ Who do you think you are? It was a big debate, gender-neutral bathrooms. And I’m all for it. Bathrooms are bathrooms. I don’t give a shit who uses my bathroom after me. Use it. You got to go, go ahead. Use the bathroom, man. It’s a good thing. For years, I was sick and tired of going to a bar and seeing girls cut the bathroom line when theirs are too long. They walk to the guys, and they go, ‘Hi, our line’ s too long. ‘Do you think me… Can we cut? Is this chill if we cut?’ I know that’s a stereotypical impression. I don’t give a shit. That’s real. ‘Can we cut?’ That’s real. And every asshole in line is like, ‘Yeah, go ahead.’ Also real, also real, also a real impression of us. You go like that. We go like that. Okay? So guys let them in, and I’m tired of that shit, ’cause we can’t use your bathrooms. Guys can’t use girls’ bathrooms at bars. You can use ours. Why can’t we use yours? The only thing I ever hear is, ‘Well, you pee on the seat.’ Do we? I don’t. I don’t pee on the seat. If you live with someone that pees on the seat, it’s ’cause they hate your fucking guts. They’re sending you a message. Oh, no, you get the groceries, Karen, you fucking bitch. Fucking asshole. He’s saying something to you. That’s between you two. What do you think? You think we walk i',\n",
              "  'n the bathroom, we just open it up, and let it go, and it’s, like, wherever it goes, it goes. I know where it goes. I got a laser pointer. I know precisely where it goes. Pff, right there. Pee on the seat. That’s amazing. It’s ridiculous. To me, I think the fix has always been remove the stalls from men’s bathrooms in bars. Remove them. Urinals or just holes in the ground, it doesn’t really matter. Guys will pee into anything. We don’t really give a shit. But get the stalls out of men’s bathrooms in bars because they shouldn’t be there in the first place, okay? They should never have been there, ’cause a girl can’t walk in now and use a urinal. Unless you can, ladies, and then I want to see it. If you can tippy-toe pee, I would love to see it. I don’t know if it’s this way or that way. I don’t know which way is better, but if you can do that, I want to check it out. But there shouldn’t be stalls in men’s bathrooms in bars in the first place, because who the fuck is pooping at the bar? You’re gonna poop at the bar? You’re gonna poop here? Steve, you’re gonna poop at the bar. The bar that we’re at, you’re gonna poop at this bar? You feel okay with that as a person, pooping at the bar? Okay, now I know who you really are. Pooping at the… Who are your friends? Who’s your family? Go home, you animal. What are you, you pig person? Poop at the bar? Are you out of your mind? You’re gross. You’re a gross human. You don’t poop at the bar. You man up if you have to poop. You man up if you have to poop. You finish your drink, pinch it off, and you walk home, so you can poop at the house naked like a grown-up… like a full-grown adult. If you’re pooping at the bar that I’m at and I see you doing that, I’m gonna walk in, look under, walk out, and go, ‘Hey, there’ s a guy pooping here ‘wearing blue Adidas. Blue Adidas, yeah. He ‘s pooping right now.’ And then leave you with your mistake. Why is everybody looking at my shoes? ‘Cause you pooped here, Mike. What’s wrong with you? Get your life locked up, pig. Go home, you pig. Say that next time you see someone pooping in a bathroom. Walk in and go, ‘Go home, you pig. You make me sick.’ Unbelievable, man, how we prote… We protect the bathrooms like they’re a big deal. Who gives a shit about the bathrooms? Dude, go to the bathroom. We protect bathrooms in this country like it’s something important. It’s remarkable to me. Sometimes you go to a restaurant, and you’re like, ‘Hey, can I get the key to the bathroom? It’s locked.’ They’re like, ‘Oh, yeah, we got the key. Here you go.’ It’s attached to a comically large ladle for no reason. You got a spoon on the goddamn thing. Now you got to take that in there, find a place for it. It’s gonna be a nightmare. Go ahead. You’re gonna hate every second of that. Why do we do that? We lock them. You keep the bathroom under lock and key? You realize in every restaurant, every restaurant you can walk right in, go right into the kitchen',\n",
              "  '? There’s no locks on a kitchen. Just walk in and go, ‘Hey, what’s up, you guys?’ Dunk your hand in some soup. More salt. Needs more salt. I got to go. I want to use the bathroom. You got the key? No. Get real. It’s a weird country, man. We live in a weird country. We live in a weird time. I didn’t want to talk about anything that’s going on right now, but because I got a lot of time, it’s the late show, I’ll do whatever the fuck I want. So let me say this. I’m proud to be from where I’m from, okay? I’m proud to be from Chicago, Illinois. I’m proud to be from the United States of America. I’m not trying to get on a patriotic kick. All I want to say is, we got some fucked-up things going on in our country. Times are really crazy. It’s unfortunate as fuck. It’s awful. People on both sides are blaming people on both sides, okay? I have cops that are in my family. Every cop is not a bad fucking person, and every person isn’t a bad person, right? These are the same fucking things. So don’t point fingers at either side. We need to be better people in general, across the fucking board. That’s it. That’s it. Good. I’m a… I’m a guy who recently, thankfully, found a woman who was dumb enough to stick around. Stupid girl, stupid girl. ‘Cause look at this, you know. Like, look at guys. You’re gross. Why would they even go for us? Why would a woman want to do stuff with you? You’re gross. You’re disgusting. Look at a naked woman. Take one look at a naked woman, right? Beautiful, symmetrical, hairless. What a creature. Whatever made it finely crafted it like a Ferrari, you know? Took time with it. And then they got to the guy, and they were like, ‘Ah, we ran out of time. ‘No, put the genitals on the outside. ‘It doesn’ t matter. ‘No one’ s gonna see. Who cares? ‘Hair? Throw some hair on it. Fine, throw some hair on it.’ It’s phenomenal. Every day we’ve fooled you. Like, we should wake up, guys, and just be like, ‘Ah, tricked them. ‘We tricked them again. We got away with murder.’ I don’t know how we ever convinced you to do anything in the first place. Kiss me where I pee? Kiss me where I pee? How? How? How? You know that place that you breathe and eat from? May I stuff my dick in there? Can I clog up your source of life with some flesh? Life, the life hole, can I just… Cork it? I want to cork it. I want to cork your life hole with my body. How on earth did you say yes? Cork it? It’s a remarkable thing, when you think about it. Like, how did we ever even start the sexual chemistry to even get to that level of doing stuff? Here you go. A guy can go to a bar. A single guy goes to a bar trying to pick up chicks. He can go out there and mumble around. I want to put my body in your body. That’s all he’s saying. Baseline level, I want to put my body in your body. Can we do that? You sound debonair at the bar. You ‘re like,’ Well, well, I work for an investment firm downtown.’ But what you’re really saying is, like, ‘I wan',\n",
              "  't to put my body in your body. I’d like to put my body inside of your body.’ That’s all it is. You’re not that cool. You’re just trying to put some of your body in someone’s body. You got a gap. I got a wedge. Can we do the thing when I put the thing in the thing? That’s it. Think about that… That’s a hard thing to do, to go out to a bar and convince a girl I’m the guy that you want to do things with. Think about how hard it was for us to start that. How did we start that? How did a caveman ever get to that point with a cave woman? How did a caveman say that when there was no language, no communication skills? First of all, when you were a caveman, you just stood around with your buddies, mumbling. That’s it. There’s really nothing going on, just a lot of… Then one of you, out of nowhere, would just get an erection. Explain that to the crew. All your buddies are mad. Hey! They don’t like it pointing at them. You got to be a nonverbal dick salesman, going up to women like… What are you selling? She doesn’t know. You can’t say it. Who said yes? The slowest girl in the pack… on a bad leg she was lugging around. Okay, okay. Okay. How did that happen? The guy that convinced a girl to do that for the first time invented fire and the wheel that afternoon. It was like… Everything clicked. I got it. Everything made sense. I would’ve loved to see the first caveman to discover pulling out. That would’ve been amazing. Right? The first guy that’s like… That’s how all that shit on the wall got started. They were like… What, do you think that was ink? That was no ink. It’s jizz symbols. How great is that fucking thing? My buddy’s an artist, and I was like, ‘I want a fucking papa bear ‘with a cubby bear with a Blackhawks headdress, ‘and I want him wearing Jordans for the Bulls ‘and white socks, and I want him eating deep dish and drinking a beer.’ And my buddy smoked enough pot as I did, and he came up with this. So it was fucking pretty amazing. The Chicago flag, yeah. Cool. It’s cool. We got a lot of pride in this town, so we should. You know what I mean? You can’t fuck with us. Come fuck with us. Where’s my crane camera? Come fuck with us, rest of the United States. Where the fuck are you guys at? Come to Chicago. Rip your fucking throats out. I’m gonna get murdered on the road in Cincinnati in, like, three months. Shit. No, I got a lady. I got a lady this year. I got locked up. I got married this year, which was great. It was a great thing. Don’t clap for that. Please don’t clap for that shit ’cause it eggs her on, and I don’t need that. No, I got married, and it was great. It was very fun. We had a good time. Yeah, it was fun. Thanks a lot. Cool. It was cool, it was cool. She came up to me at the jump, and she was like, she ‘s like,’ What do you think about doing, like, bachelor, bachelorette parties, like, all that stuff?’ We didn’t talk about, like, really any of that stuff. We really kind of didn’t really get ',\n",
              "  'into the nitty-gritty, and I was like, ‘Well, whatever you want to do.’ She was like, ‘Do you want to have a bachelor party?’ And I was like, ‘I don’ t know. ‘Like, I do stand-up for a living, ‘so, like, it’ s just always kind of a fucking bachelor party. My life is kind of a bachelor party.’ I was like, ‘No, I’m good.’ You know what I mean? Like, I just took my best friend for his bachelor party, and I was like, ‘That’s good enough for me.’ I was like, ‘You can do a bachelorette party. Don ‘t feel like you can’t.’ She was like, ‘Are you cool with it?’ I was like, ‘I promise. I’m totally cool with it. Whatever you want to do, you ‘re good. Do it.’ She was like, ‘Okay, trust me. It ‘ll be classy.’ That’s some dumb shit. Girls are like, ‘It’ s gonna be classy. ‘The bachelorette party… It’s gonna be cla… I promise. We won’t be as crazy as you think we’re gonna be.’ She was like, ‘We’ re going to Northern California ‘to a vineyard. We ‘re gonna do wine tasting.’ So in girls’ brains, they think that we think that that’s nice and sweet, but I know the truth. I know they’re not wine tasting. I know they’re blacking out on wine. I know they’re getting purple toothed out, Charlie Chaplain-ing around town like… I know. I know what you’re doing, looking like Grimace. I know. I know. Lie to me, you drunks… trying to pretend like… We pretend like wine is so sophisticated. It’s still booze. Stinky-foot grapes, that’s all it is. Go on a vineyard tour with her girlfriends. See, ’cause here’s the thing about bachelorette parties. I’m sure every girl in this room is a wonderful human being. I’m sure you’re all stand-up citizens until you get in a bachelorette party, and then you’re a piece of shit. Then you’re a piece of shit. Then you storm around town like, ‘Look at us, penises everywhere. ‘Penises on our body. ‘Penis necklace. These are dick-laces. ‘These are dick necklaces. This is a dick hat. ‘These are dick glasses. They’re dick shoes. ‘Look at it. It comes. This one comes. ‘It comes out of that shoe. When I go like that, it comes.’ What’s wrong with you? Who are your parents? Shame on you, these women who walk around town doing that shit. It’s unbelievable… Bachelorette parties that take over every bar they go to, screaming. These bitches work in HR during the day, but at night… they’re just like, ‘Penis, penis, penis. Penis, penis, penis, penis.’ Who are your parents? Shame on you. You realize some little kid in China has to make those penis molds? Some little kid in China is pressing penises, penis sunglasses, so you can go out like, ‘Cocks, cocks on my head.’ You psycho. That’s where guys beat you. That’s, like, the one spot we beat you. We may be dumber than you, but we beat you there. We beat you by a landslide, because I have never been to a bachelor party where they’re like, ‘Santino, you ready to go? Put on your pussy costume. Let ‘s go.’ I put one on like… ‘Come on, let’ s go. ‘Get mine wet. Steve, get m',\n",
              "  'ine wet. ‘Get it wet. Get the clit wet. ‘Go. Get it wet. This is what we want.’ ‘Vaginer.’ We beat you. So we went and got married out of the country. We went to Costa Rica. We went down to Costa Rica. It was great. Central America, beautiful place. Costa Rica is amazing. We loved it. It was fantastic. I didn’t know that racism is everywhere. I had no idea, but it is, but it really fucking is. Here we are in our hotel, two men are in a fight with one man, two guys on one, two on one, working this dude, and I look out the window, and I’m like, ‘Oh, my God, what happened?’ To the local guy. And the local guy, who we know, who we’re buddies with, is like, ‘Oh, yeah, the fight?’ And I was like, ‘Yeah, what happened?’ I’m ready for the story. And he ‘s like,’ Okay, you see this guy on the ground? ‘You see him on the ground, ‘this guy who they kick in the face? ‘You see him? ‘You know, this guy on the ground they kick in the teeth. You see him?’ I was like, ‘Yeah, yeah, definitely. Yeah, what is that?’ And he goes, ‘Oh, yeah, this guy, this guy on the ground, he ‘s from Panama.’ What? ‘He’ s from Panama. Panama, the country. Panama.’ That’s it? That was as deep as the well got dug. ‘He’s from Panama.’ That’s it. I was like, ‘But how did the fight… Like, how did you… How did the fight happen?’ He goes, ‘Oh, sí, sí, sí, sí, sí, sí. ‘Okay, so this guy on the ground, ‘he cut off this guy in traffic, ‘and he says to him, ‘Hey, what the fuck?’ ‘And this guy, he says, ‘Hey, man, fuck you.’ ‘So this guy, he gets out of his car, ‘and he says, ‘Mm-mm, fuck you.’ ‘So then they yell at each other. ‘So this guy say fuck you. ‘This guy, fuck you. This guy, fuck… So both of these guys are fucking you right now.’ I was like, ‘No one’ s fucking me. What are you talking about?’ ‘And then his friend, he hear him from across the street, ‘and his friend, he says, ‘Hey, what happened?’ ‘He says, ‘He said, fuck you.’ ‘He says,’ Ah, fuck you.’ ‘He says, ‘Fuck you.’ He says. ‘Fuck you.’ He fuck… these guys over here are fucking you.’ ‘And the one guy, he says to him… ‘Before he fight with him, he says, ”Hey, motherfucker, where are you from?’ ‘And this guy, he says, ‘Panama.’ ‘And, uh… That ‘s it for him.’ Other than that, it was a beautiful country, man. It was gorgeous, man. We did so much white-people shit. It was unbelievable. You know what white-people shit is. Everybody in here knows it, right? It’s, like… We went zip-lining. It’s, like, white-water rafting, all that white-people… White-water rafting is white-people shit. It’s called white-water rafting. It’s ours. That’s some white-people shit. You’ll never, ever see a black guy white-water rafting, skydiving, drinking coffee. That’s just not what they do. It’s not what they do. Skydiving, all that shit. Black guy, do you go skydiving? Never in your fucking life, man. No way. Never in your life. Rock climbing? No way. White-water rafting? No. None of the above. Do you even li',\n",
              "  'ke coffee? I do like coffee. Oh, come on, man. What did he say? I like it black. You like it black. I get that. I get that. You can have that. Take it black. Take it black. So he knows what I’m talking about. He knows. I went to college with… One of my closest friends in college was this dude we lived with, and he would always make fun of me. He ‘s like,’ You’re doing some white-people shit, Red. You on some white-people shit right now.’ I was like, ‘I’m taking out the trash.’ He’s like… ‘That’s the type of shit I’m talking about, motherfucker. ‘Just throw that shit outside, bitch. ‘White-people shit! ‘What you doing, dishes, motherfucker? You white-ass motherfucker.’ What you doing, laundry, you Charmin-ass motherfucker? You Charmin’… I did so much white-people shit in Costa Rica. It was bananas. I loved it, though. I love being a tourist. Like, that’s the fucked-up thing about Americans. We don’t want to be tourists. Why not? Why are we so afraid of being tourists? I’ll do that zip-line dork-ass shit. Give me the helmet. I love that. How much is the picture? $1,000? I don’t give a shit. I’ll pay for that, plan for it. Come on, man. Give me that dork tourist shit. We’re so afraid as Americans to be tourists. Yet for some reason, tourists come here. They’re not afraid to be tourists. You can go to Michigan Avenue right now. There’s a cute little Italian couple that’s like, ‘Mi scusi, mi scusi, mi scusi. The water tower, the water tower.’ And you ‘re like,’ Ah, come here. Let me lie to you. Come here, come here, come here.’ Let them be tourists, man. Be a tourist. Be a tourist. All I’m saying is, stop being such a liar. Be who you really are. You’re out of the country. Be out of the country, man. There’s nothing wrong with that, you know. Here’s why. Every time I’ve ever been to a Spanish-speaking country, there’s always one guy in the crew, one dude who’s like, ‘Hey, I got us. I can take us around. ‘I speak a little bit of Mexican. ‘We’ re gonna be good. We ‘ll be good.’ You speak Mexican, Brad? I speak Mexican, dog. I got us. Don’t sweat it, man. I took 101 in high school. We’re gonna be straight. And you’re like, ‘All right, man. I can’t wait.’ You walk into a restaurant. I say the truth. I walk in, I go, ‘Hello, American, americano, ‘American, ready to be ripped off. Look at me.’ ‘Cause I don’t give a shit. How much is that Coke? Seven? Thought it was ten. You can’t fuck me. You can’t fuck me. I planned for that. You cannot fuck me. But he walks in. Brad walks in, talking Mexican like, ‘Hola, seniors. Hola, seniors.’ He thinks he’s the shit. Brad walks in heavy, and the staff looks at him like, ‘Okay, okay, okay, okay. ¿Habla español, señor? ¿Habla español? ¿Habla español?’ Sí, sí, sen-yours. Sí, sí, sen-yours. Ha-blah a-spaniel. Ha-blah a-spaniel. Ha-blah a-spaniel. And they ‘re all like,’ Okay. ‘Hmm. Good, good, good. That’s good, good. That’s good.’ And they just machine-gun Spanish at his fuckin',\n",
              "  'g head until you see him go, ‘Oh, fuck. ‘There’s no bibliotecain there. Where’s the ban-yo? I don’t know any of those words.’ Brad looks like an asshole. Meanwhile, I’m enjoying my plate of rice and ‘polo,’ having a great time… enjoying my life. I came back from Costa Rica. It was fantastic, and then we got into that, like, all the marriage discussion shit. She was like, ‘What do you want to do about the last name?’ I was like, ‘I don’ t know. I mean, I don’t really care. I don’t think I really care.’ I was like, ‘I mean, what do you want to do?’ She’s like, ‘Well, do you want me to take your last name?’ And there’s a part of you that’s like, ‘No, man, it’s cool.’ Then there’s a part of you that’s like, ‘Yeah, you got to take the last name.’ It’s some male-ego bullshit, but that’s the truth of the situation. Like, it doesn’t really mean much. Like, what are last names anyway? I don’t really know. We don’t really know, you know. Last names… you used to give to somebody ’cause it represented land, right? You had some land. You get some land to give. Like, ‘This will all be yours one day.’ That doesn’t mean shit nowadays. I can’t be like, ‘Son, this condominium will be yours when I die.’ Who gives a shit, right? There’s not much to it. You know, it really doesn’t mean much. But it’s strange when I think about, like, white people’s last names, like, where our last names came from. A lot of times, it used to be your occupation, right? Like, I meet a guy… Kevin Blacksmith. His great-great-great-great- grandfather was a blacksmith. Dave Shoemaker, his great-great-great-great- grandfather was a shoemaker. But it’s weird when you meet a white guy named Eric Lynch… ‘Cause you’re like, ‘Your great-great-great-great- grandfather was a bad person.’ Switch it up, dog. But last names are kind of bullshit. You know know what I mean? They mean whatever they want and whatever you want them to mean, and so she said, ‘What do you want to do?’ I said, ‘How about we just go with whosever last name is cooler?’ Right, whosever’s is cooler. She was like, ‘Cooler?’ I was like, ‘Yeah,’ ’cause in my head, I knew it was already game over. I was like, ‘Jordan, buckets.’ I knew it was over. I knew it was over. She wasn’t fucking with Santino. What a cool-ass name, Santino. Three syllables… San, unh, ti, got you, oh. That’s what’s up. I had it. It was in the bag, man. It was in the bag. It was game over. Jordan. It was game over, but then she was like, ‘Oh, you think your last name is that much cooler?’ I said, ‘Yeah.’ Her last name was Eichelberger. You want me to say it again? Eichelberger. And she’s like, ‘What’s wrong with that?’ I was like, ‘What’ s right with that shit? What are you talking about, lady?’ She’s like, ‘It’s not that big of a deal.’ I said, ‘Well, it’s like part of the Third Reich.’ I’ll have to walk into restaurants, like… ‘We’ re here for the Eichelberger party, ‘the party of two. ‘There is two of us at the part',\n",
              "  'y. ‘We would like the table in the back of the room. ‘In the back of the room, ‘behind the air-conditioning, please. Thank you.’ Anyway, she’s a Santino now. Yeah. We got into a thing, ’cause I was… I feel like I’m watching too much porn lately, if I’m just being real with you guys. We’re getting real. It’s a late-night show. I was watching too much porn. Porn is bad. It’s a bad thing. It’s really addictive. It is. It truly is. I think it’s not my fault, though. I think it’s access… access, too much access. In your pockets, there’s a phone, right? In there is all the porno… All of it… all of it that we make. All of it that we make, you guys. If I had three seconds inside of a time machine, I would ‘zorb’ myself to when I was 14, for three seconds, and just go… ‘In the future, all the porno’s in your pocket,’. And get out… and blow my mind. Just… semen everywhere. Oh, my God. I’m waiting for this JPEG to load. Come on, man. That’s crazy. That is crazy to think about. It really is too much access. Like, I can’t walk past a laptop without being like… ‘Ah, this is Best Buy. I got to go.’ The Blue Shirts, they don’t like that. You know what I mean? They get weird. We’ve seen so much of it. The problem is… With porn is, it’s got this stigma where we think we can emulate that stuff. Like, you think you’re like them. You’re not like them. Those are pros, man. Those are pros. I got envy. I have envy, envy. The way that these men throw a rope is remarkable. They just… It takes off. It’s got loft. Are you kidding me? I’m lucky if mine comes out. It’s like a pensive army. It gets to the surface, and it ‘s like,’ No, no. Go back, go back.’ And when it does come out, it’s late for the party. It has nonalcoholic beer. It’s like, ‘Sorry. We’re here.’ My wife… one night she was like, ‘Oh, come on my tits.’ I was like, ‘Oh, I’ll never make it up there.’ It’s so far. It’s too far. Maybe your belly button, max… if I really put in the work. I’ll tell you what I’ve been watching a lot of. I’ve been watching a lot of black porn, lots of black porn. Blackblack. Too. Like, chocolate, chocolate, chocolate, chocolate. Deep chocolate, 99% cacao chocolate. Sexy. No milk. Get out of here, milk chocolate. No time for you. Chocolate, chocolate. I love watching black porn, love watch… For one fundamental reason. The guys get to wear shoes… on their feet. Men wear shoes on their feet. If you know anything about how shoes and pants work, anything at all, you know that these men took off their shoes, took off their pants and underwear, and then put back on their shoes. Come on. You did it again, black people. Numero uno. I got the envy, man. It’s a bad thing. It really is. It’s a bad thing. We need to clean up our minds, clean up our life. You know what I mean? Get clean, clean living. Eat a smoothie, take a walk. It’s difficult, man. It’s difficult to do. People always… like, listen, I try to work out. I’m trying to be in shape. I’m try',\n",
              "  'ing to do all that stuff. It’s a hard thing to do. You know, fast food, going to get fast food always reminds me of what it was like when I was single, going to a one-night stand. It was like the same thing, like the exact same feeling. You’ll be looking on Google Maps to try to find out if that fast-food joint’s open, right? You’re like, ‘You up, McDonald’s? You up?’ You send a late-night text, like, ‘What’ s up, girl? ‘You up? What’s up, McDonald’s? ‘You up? What’s up, Mac D’s? Is you up, playboy? Give me them nuggets.’ She’s like, ‘Uh-huh.’ McDonald’s is like, ‘You know it.’ You cruise over there, and on the way, you’re like, ‘Ooh, it’ s gonna be good. ‘I know what I get at this location. ‘This is my favorite spot to go to at this time of night. That number two is my spot right now.’ That’s a butt joke. You get over there, and you eat that. You devour that McDiesel’s. Just like that, you’re like… Devour it. And when you’re done, you get in the car and cruise home… Same feeling. Cruising home, and you’re like… ‘I’m a bad person, man.’ Sad. I had to cut that out. I had to cut it out, man. I’m trying to stay healthy. I’m trying to fit into my own skin. That’s really what it is. You know, I’m trying to feel good about myself. It’s a confidence thing about people. You want to feel confident and cocky, but, like, not too much. Like, I had my ego tested. I got into a car accident. A man hit me. A man hit me. I was at a red light. A man hit me, okay? Red light, skrrr, man, bmm-bmm-bmm, hit me, and I got out of my car. He got out of his car, and I went to say something. Before I could say anything, he goes, ‘Hey, what the fuck?’ And I said… ‘That’ s my line. ‘I say that. That’s me. ‘I’m doing… That’s what I do. You say, ‘I’m sorry,’ I feel like.’ He was a big-ass dude. He was big, jacked up, and he had tattoos up to his face? Question mark. You good, bro? On your face? You cashed out? You got cancer? What’s up? On your face? I feel like that’s some, like, ‘I don’t give a… ‘Whatever, bro. Go ahead. It’s done. ‘I don’ t give a shit. ‘I’ ve been collecting Marlboro miles for years. I ‘ll cash out.’ On your face? So I had no way to win this war. This dude was in my face. I had no… I was backed up. I was like, ‘Whatever, man.’ And in that moment, I was like, ‘I can’ t win this argument with this dude. I can ‘t beat him physically.’ But I was like, ‘If I had a superpower right now, ‘you know, it wouldn’ t be to, like, fly or be invisible. I would love to be able to throw acne on somebody.’ Right? He’s all, ‘Fuck you.’ I’m like, ‘Fuck me? Fuck you, man.’ No! Hit him all over the body, shoulder, bacne. Hit him with the bacne. Hit him with the kn-acne, that knee acne. Light him up, light him up. Scar him physically and emotionally, send him home like that for a couple of weeks, depending on the topical cream. Let it sit. Let it sit. If you’re not laughing at that, you didn’t have acne when you were a kid. I had reall',\n",
              "  'y bad acne when I was a kid, man. It was so bad. It was so bad. Like, acne is, like, the sole reason I questioned God. I’m like, ‘What up, dude? What’s the deal? ‘Where are you at on this one, player? This is ridiculous.’ Here you are, 13, 14 years old. You’re the ugliest version of yourself. Look at photos of you at 14. TBT them on Instagram, and you’re like, ‘Ooh, tough-looking kid.’ You’re ugly, bro. You are ugly at 14. Teenagers are so gross to look at, hard to see. They’re hard to see, bro. They’re skinny. Their voices are crackling. They’re wobbling all over like little skinny baby giraffes, just hungry and horny like… Nasty-looking crea… They look like Tim Burton cartoons. They’re barely alive. You are nasty as a child. And you’re telling me at this vulnerable point in your life, God is gonna be like, ‘You know what? ‘I’ m gonna put some red pus bumps on his face. Pus bump his face up.’ I didn’t get it. I didn’t understand it. I had it so bad. I had to go on Accutane. You used to have to sign a form that said. ‘I can die from this medication.’ What’s up, guys? What are we saying? I can die from this medi… I can die from this medication. And I was underage, so I had a legal guardian. So my mother had to sign it. I was 16. I’ll never forget. They slipped the sheet to my mother, and she looked at it, and then she looked at me. Yeah. Yeah, this is… it’s… it’s better than your face. It doesn’t really matter. You’re an ugly kid. You’re ugly. It’s… it’s for you. I had it so bad. I had acne so bad when I was young. When I was in high school, I played basketball for a couple years at my high school until I found out about drugs, and I was like, ‘See you later, basketball.’ Ah, true story. But I played basketball for a little while. When I played basketball, I made the JV team pretty early on, and we played in a summer league, okay? In the summer league, you had to play all the other schools that you were going to play in that regular season, and I’ll never forget. We went out to West Aurora to go play these guys, and they were supposed to beat us. They were, like, a really good school, right? They were really good. They were an all-black school. We were a some-black school. They were gonna beat us. Bottom line, they were gonna win. And we went out there, and we beat the shit out of these guys. I had the game of my life. I dropped four points. I was on fire. If you know anything about high-school basketball, four points is like, whoa. What are you, MVP? Final score, 12-2. It was a blowout. I mean, we went out there. I had a great game. I was on cloud nine. I felt like a king. Then I left, and I went out to the hallway to go get a drink of water. I’m getting a drink of water, bending down by the water fountain to have a drink of water. A little black kid, like, eight years old walks in the hallway. Comes up to me and goes, ‘Hey, yo, white boy. White boy.’ I go, ‘What’s up?’ You’re pretty good, man. Oh, tha',\n",
              "  'nks, man. He goes, ‘For a white boy.’ And I was still like, ‘Thank you. I appreciate that.’ I’ll take it. Then he goes, ‘All right, man.’ I go, ‘All right, man.’ He walks away. Felt good. Go down to get some more water. He gets to the doorway. He stops… real Forest Whitaker-style. He turns around and goes, ‘Hey, yo, white boy.’ I say, ‘What’s up, man? What up?’ He goes, ‘What the fuck is all over your face?’ That still hurts today. I’m in my 30s. That cut went all the way to the bone. You know what I mean? Then I walked up to him slowly, and I said, ‘Well, this is what happens when your dad sticks around.’ No, I didn’t say that. That’s a joke, man. No, I called him the N word. Then I got out of there as fast as I could. No, stop it. I cried on the bus, man. I cried on the bus. Got to have a sense of humor, man. But I always loved black people. I always did. I really did. I still do. I still do love black people, man. I think they’re fantastic human beings. Black people always accepted me. Black people really did. White people never liked me. White people don’t like redheads for some reason. There’s this thing. White people see redheads, and they’re like, ‘What do we do with it?’ They don’t like us. They don’t trust us. They make a day to kick us. Call us names… ‘You fire crotch, you ginger.’ They ask us stupid questions, like does the carpet match the drapes? A black guy’s never said that to me. White guys… ‘The carpet match the drapes, bud?’ And I’m always like, ‘Are you a grown-up asking ‘about my penis hair? ‘Is that the level that you’re on? ‘You’ re worried about my penis hair, dude. ‘If you must know, it’s hardwood floors. There ‘s no carpet there, bro.’ I clean it up. Go get you a little buzzer from Target and clean that shit up. You get under there. It’s like… It’s working overtime under there. That’s the no-fly zone, no-fly zone. It might die under there, like… I can’t, I can’t. White people never liked me. They never did. They always made fun of me. That’s a reality check. Now people are like, ‘Huh? What are you talking about?’ White people always made fun of redheads. Redheads are this outcast. We’re this weird minority for some reason, but black people always liked me. They really did. They took to me. Like, black people like white people with a deficiency. I’m like a dog with one bad leg. You know, white people don’t adopt that dog, but black people are like, ‘No, no, no. ‘He good, he good, he good. ‘He gonna be fine. Come here, Tripod. ‘He gonna be fine. Tripod. ‘Come here, Tripod. It gonna work out.’ That’s just the truth. It just made me feel normal when I was a kid. So I loved hip-hop culture. I loved everything all my black friends liked, so much so that in the ’90s, people used to say this word. People used to call me a ‘wigger.’ Do you remember that word? Don’t get uncomfortable. You all said it. You all said it. I don’t know why we got rid of it. It was hilarious. You should’ve stu',\n",
              "  'ck around for a while. People used to call me a ‘wigger.’ People used to say ‘wigger’ to me ’cause they thought it would hurt my feelings. They thought, like, that was a way to get my goat. You know what I mean? And I’ll never forget. I was on a basketball court the first time I heard it, and we had won this basketball game, and this dude from the losing team says… ‘Whatever, bro. That dude ain’t nothing but a wigger.’ And all my black friends heard it, and they were disappointed. They heard him say that, and they were like… That’s how they sound, like a train. They were like… When black guys are bummed out, it sounds like a train, just… Next stop, Sedgwick. But they were bummed out ’cause that was an attack, you know. They didn’t like that, but when I heard it, I heard it different, ’cause they were like, ‘That white dude ain’t nothing but a wigger.’ And I heard it, and I was like, ‘Oh… so close.’ How do I get that N? How do I get that N? These are Karl Kani jeans. This is a Perry Ellis shirt. Give it to me. I bought Timberland boots. Say it if you’re gonna say it, you racist motherfuckers. Say it. How do I get that, man? It was just me being real. That’s all that was. I wanted to be a black guy. I thought I was black. I thought I was a black guy. Even to this day, I still have a lot of black friends, and I got to tell you… Every time I talk to my black guy friends, I’m always like, ‘Hey, man, don’t date white girls.’ Don’t date white girls. Not ’cause I’m racist. I’m clearly not racist. I have black friends. I’m not a racist. I tell my black guy friends to not date white girls ’cause I genuinely care about the future of sports. That’s it. We don’t need any placekickers and long snappers. We want dunk contests, right? How do you get a Heisman? You know what I mean? Not from Jerome and Cassie. Jerome and Jaquanda… That’s how we’re gonna make a Heisman, two beautiful chocolate people making love under a beautiful chocolate rain shower while he’s got shoes on. We know the formula. We know the formula. Drake is the number-one dude in hip-hop. His name is Aubrey. Yeah! We let him get away with that. Drake’s name is Aubrey, and nobody said shit about it. Aubrey, number one in hip-hop. What’s his name, Aubrey? Got it. Okay, cool. We’re good. He had beef with Meek Mill. It was a big beef. You’re it. Tag, you’re it. You’re it. Tag. Remember real beef? You remember when hip-hop was, like, real beef? People hated each other. Tupac and Biggie hated each other so much, and they were best friends at one point. They had real beef so deep that Tupac started a song called ‘Hit ‘Em Up’… Before he started the lyrics, he goes, ‘So I fucked your bitch, you fat motherfucker.’ That’s what he said. You’re fat. Fucked your girlfriend. Okay, let’s go. Here we go. That’s crazy. That’s how much he hated that guy. That’s real beef. I feel like hip-hop has, like, dissipated, you know. It’s just, like, gone by the wayside, and I bl',\n",

Macklemore is not hip-hop. You can like him, but he’s not hip-hop, okay? That’s pop. He talks about going downtown on a scooter with his pals. Come on, bro. What? You’re gonna go downtown with your buddies on a scooter, Macklemore? That’s not hip-hop. Hip-hop doesn’t go downtown. Hip-hop lives downtown, and it goes to the suburbs and robs those people and comes back downtown. It doesn’t go downtown. Talking about thrift stores. Fuck you, bro. Don’t fucking talk about discount clothing! No! I don’t want to hear that, man. I want to hear a rapper be like… And I’m like, ‘You got it, you got it.’ That’s what I want to hear, man. I want to hear Rick Ross be like… That’s what I want to hear. Get out of here, Macklemore. What’s wrong with you, bro? This guy’s bullshit. We can’t call him hip-hop. It’s crazy that he’s hip-hop, ’cause it’s not. It’s all some sensitive-ass shit. The thing that made me the most mad about Macklemore is he co-wrote this song he got a Grammy nomination for that arguably made him famous, right? It made him famous, right? It was called ‘Same Love.’ It was about same-sex marriage. Now, the song and the depth of the song I’m not against. I’m for same-sex marriage. I don’t give a shit who you want to marry, okay? You want to marry who you want to marry? Go crazy, man. You don’t fuck kids or animals, I don’t care. That’s it for me. No kids, no animals, we’re straight. You want to marry your toaster? Go crazy. Just don’t return that. I don’t want to buy that fucked toaster. So the song I’m okay with. It’s at the beginning of the song, the intro. He goes, ‘When I was in the third grade, I thought that I was gay.’ Remember this bullshit? I thought that I was gay. When I was in the third grade, I thought I was a gay person. That’s what he said. I thought I was one of you fellas. Thank God I’m not. I’m not, but I thought I was. I thought so. I hated that. I hated that ’cause they applauded him. They were like, ‘Oh, how bold. ‘How brave of Macklemore. ‘He thought he was a homosexual. ‘In third grade, he thought he was a homosexual. ‘He’ s not, which is good, but he thought he was. He thought he was a gay.’ And they thought that was, like, a risky thing to say… ‘I thought I was gay when I was in third grade.’ I hate that shit. You remember third grade? I do. Everybody was gay. Everybody in here in third grade was gay. You were all gay. I wore sweat pants. I played the recorder. I was very gay. I used to Rollerblade around my neighborhood, like, ‘Hey, fellas.’ I would fag out all day. Like… I was homosexual, bro. It wasn’t a question. It was a fact. That kid’s gay as shit.

              " ['Beth Stelling’s stand-up comedy special, “Girl Daddy,” was released on HBO Max on August 20, 2020. The show was recorded at the Varsity Theater in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Beth Stelling is a comedian who has been in the industry for over a decade. Her comedy style is known for being artfully hilarious and thought-provoking. In “Girl Daddy,” Stelling talks about her family, society, and the exes who have shaped her. She shares her experiences with sex, drugs, and babies in a way that is both relatable and entertaining. In this special, Stelling talks about how she has been called a “female comic” so many times that if she ever has kids, they might as well call her “girl daddy”. She also shares her thoughts on the societal expectations placed on women and how she has navigated them throughout her life. * * * ♪ So I started to speak freely ♪ ♪ Figured it would lead me to war or a peace treaty ♪ ♪ And knew no matter what, end up with a deep sleep ♪ ♪ And the habits of a soul who knows what it’s seeking ♪ ♪ You’re thinking it’s a joke, but it’s not folks ♪ ♪ It’s all in the delivery ♪ Thank you. Thank you guys. Thank you for coming out. It is good to be here in Minneapolis, thank you. Whenever I’m on tour, I have to prepare to be gone for awhile. And so I was at the pharmacy, I was picking up my prescription for acne. I love my acne, keeps me young. I’m on antibiotics, they’re working. I’ve been on them for seven years, which I heard is good for you. Before that, I was on spironolactone, any spiro heads here? Are you really on it? Did it make you pee a lot? Yes, and it made me faint. What? Did it thin your hair at all? No. Okay, we can, we’ll talk more later. It did, it made me pee a lot, it thinned my hair out, it made my boobs hurt really bad. I grew very alarmed and I chose to do nothing. I just waited for the follow-up appointment with the doctor and he said, “Oh yeah, I should have told you, “it’s going to make your boobs,” he actually said titties, he was like, “It’s going to make your titties more sensitive.” I thought, that would have been nice to know. I’ve been slowly saying goodbye to my family. So I’m at the pharmacy, you can’t help, but pick up other things, they design',\n",
              "  'ed it that way. And Easter is my favorite season of candy. Now, thankfully they have Peeps pretty much year-round. So I picked up some, who knows, Flag Day peeps. I don’t look at the shape before, I barely taste when I eat. And I also picked up a bunch of condoms ’cause I’m the breadwinner of most of my relationships. And I’m also not on birth control because sometimes birth control is like, I know you’re hungry, but what if you cried? So I don’t do that. And as I’m checking out the man at the pharmacy, he slides my prescription and I sign for it. He slides the Peeps and then he goes to slide the condoms and for some reason out loud to him, I say, “These aren’t for me.” I’m a grown woman in my sixties, like I’m very open about sex, all of a sudden a man, I don’t know, touches a box of condoms, and I’m like these, I would never, I got back to my car and I turned inward. I was like, what happened back there, man? You got weird. I don’t know, I guess if you’re a dude buying condoms, maybe you feel cool. ‘Cause like you’re gonna get laid or whatever. I don’t know how you feel. Do you, or, he’s like I don’t wear condoms, because I don’t get pregnant. That always cracks me up, wen the dude chimes in with like, she trapped me with a baby. Impossible. You have the missing ingredient and we love to bake. if I had all the ingredients for a cake except for the sugar, and then you, what’s your name? Jeremy. Jeremy brought over the sugar, we’d be like this cake wouldn’t be possible without Jeremy. thank you so much for this cake, Jeremy. Jeremy, Jeremy, Jeremy. That’s right. What I’m saying is men are garbage, but But, women are the can, okay. So we’re in it together. Sometimes you have to flip us over and shake us for us to let go of garbage. But I think what it boils down to in my personal opinion, I think dudes, you’re just, you’re more in touch with your personal pleasure from a very early age. Late elementary, early junior high, the boys I grew up with in Ohio were just constantly talking about jerking off or jerking off or doing this motion, which I added to my vocabulary far too soon. I had no clue what it meant. I would just be like, okay, mom, take a gamble. I was punished. It’s s',\n",
              "  'o high. What are we doing with it up here? Everybody knows, it’s like… vi-vi-vi-vi… Like who are you jerking off that’s shoulder height. That’s question one from me. Then sex ed happened in junior high. I remember our health teacher saying I taught my sons how to masturbate. I was like, is that legal? I thought we were hiding it. But young girls have sex organs, too. Even though some of us don’t look down until we’re 23. But as a kid, I was secretly humping all kinds of stuff around the house. I was humping the couch, I was humping the bannister, with a pillow after this splinter incident. I was humping the edge of the bathtub. I remember one year my mom wanted to move and I said, we can’t. My girlfriends live here. Can you imagine if we taught our daughters to masturbate? My mom could’ve kept decorative pillows about, instead it took like the strength of three of my closest girlfriends when we turned 18 to even go to a sex store. Meanwhile, I feel like into adulthood, dudes, you can just hop in your car, drive somewhere, get fully jerked off. I was a little vague. In my head, I was thinking like a rub and tug scenario or a happy ending situation. You know what I’m talking about? He was like, yes, that’s how we met. Have any women here been offered a happy ending? Just an angry silence. It’s more of a man’s game, the happy ending. I guess it’s what we look at as like your complete and total relaxation, either that or we look at your semen as poison and we’re like, get it out of them so they don’t hurt anybody. I think it’s a positive thing, as long as nobody’s freaking trapped in a room. And of course whether you know it or not, there’s tons of sex workers all around us. The problem is whenever I get a massage, I just assume that the massage therapist is falling in love with me. Do you do that, I’m like we’re not talking, but I’m pretty sure he’s impressed with my back. And maybe my shoulders would drop two inches if somebody just offered to like, just a little bit. But no, for a lot of reasons, a lot of liabilities, the main one being that massage therapists are not sex workers. That’s the big one. It got conflated along the way. I don’t know why, maybe because people were al',\n",
              "  'ready naked. I feel like if somebody started offering hand jobs at the pool, lifeguards would probably suffer the same plight. They’re just like trying to save somebody and the person’s like, yeah, choke me. And I’m like, what the fuck? I don’t think that the female orgasm is as equated with relaxation and release. I think it’s because everyone assumes women relax by like curling up on a couch at night, underneath a quilt that we made, just warming ourselves by a fire, while we pet our cat, and sip Celestial Seasonings tea like mmm, mmm, mmm. I’ve never orgasmed that way. Not once, it would take so much from the cat and its little paw. And then after an hour I’d be like, get off of me. I’ll do it myself. I have a good amount of guy friends that genuinely believe that they like sex more than women. And I love orgasming. There’s not a woman in here who doesn’t love orgasming. It’s the sex that’s the problem. Now, look, I assume every man in here tonight is just so good at fucking, so I’m not talking about anybody in here. The problem is outside and we just have to take what we talk about here tonight and help them. I try to have healthy conversations about these things. I did a podcast recently in exchange for some tap water and two new fans. The podcast, it was hosted by a male comedian and he wanted to talk about the Me Too movement because you gotta if you have a lady on the pod. And his hot take was sort of the Me Too movement, well, what are we supposed to do now? I was like, what were you doing before? I guess keep doing or stop doing that. Now we were doing shows together all weekend and I was the only comic on the shows who agreed to do his podcast. So I decided to take it as an opportunity to confront him about one of his jokes that I didn’t love and this podcast was never released . We don’t like to be challenged. But he had a joke that he was performing that went like I used to fuck chicks all the time after shows. Which is true. When a male comic’s up here, it’s very attractive to women, a sense of humor, and he has an hour window after the show to capitalize on that before the girl finds out like, oh my God, he’s so sad. So his joke was like, I used to fuck chicks a',\n",
              "  'll the time after shows. Now, if I want to fuck a chick and she likes it rough, I’m going to need paperwork to fuck. Insinuating that if she were also into rough sex, she would then later lie and use it to accuse him of, what’s it called when somebody wants to have sex with you, but you don’t, and they do it anyway? Rape. Thank you, it’s so much easier when somebody else brings it up. People do not like hearing a woman comic say that word. I guess because the dudes are like, hey, that’s our thing. I think paperwork’s a good idea. I’m for it. I am pro paperwork. Just to be clear, I think it’s interesting he decided to live in a profession that’s been relegated to women for the last hundred years like he’d probably need me to like draw up the paperwork for him. In which case, I could put a clause in there that says not bringing the female to climax is punishable by law. Or something, I don’t know, I’m spitballing. And then maybe a clause in there for him that says like the safe word is stop. Give that a whirl. It just bothered me that night after night, he was performing these jokes for crowds full of people just like you. Well, we were in Vegas, like nothing like you. Just scaring roomfuls of dudes about having post-Me Too sex, when most of you guys are doing it right. There’s probably only like one rapist in here. I don’t know, maybe two, look around, they’re not laughing. Are you sitting here as a heterosexual man, and you don’t know how to touch a woman, like get up here. I’ll show you, I’m just kidding. I feel like, do you know how to pet a cat? How about that? If you’re scared during these times and you’re alone with a woman, just pretend that it’s a cat. That’s my advice for you. Just wait for it to come up to you. It might take a while. Let it smell you before you pet it. And if it’s all curled up sleeping, don’t pick it up. It doesn’t like that. And then if the cat comes up to you and starts rubbing its face on your face, hard, sometimes shockingly hard, then you can ask yourself, like, is this cat trying to fuck? And then yes, go ahead and fuck that cat. You guys seem cool. Maybe I was wrong and I was just overly worried for you guys. I just didn’t like that he would b',\n",
              "  'e scaring you, but maybe you’re not scared at all, and it’s just like a handful of celebrities and some very vocal comics that are scared, scared of getting accused of rape. For some reason, it’s easier to hear in a Scottish accent. I don’t know, I don’t know why they’re scared. They’re going to get away with it. If they go through this system is what I’m saying. I was watching a famous colleague of mine yell into a microphone and he was like, so you know there’s no due process, it’s fricking crazy. A woman makes a claim and people just believe her without going through the legal system. I’m like, ah, the legal system, or as I like to call it, the white man’s FUBU… just For Us By Us. It’s their safe space really. It’s why they have a checklist of things they like you to go down after you’ve been raped. Number one: did you go to the cops? It’s like me personally, I would rather talk to Ice T’s character of a cop than a real cop if I got raped, because at least Ice T would listen and then say something like, that’s messed up. And then when he got back to the precinct, he’d probably fire something off like gotta be Mrs. Butterworth in order to make a rape charge stick. Two: they’re always like, did you go to the hospital? It’s like, do you guys remember at the beginning, when I thought I had breast cancer and I just waited it out. If I got raped, I don’t want to run an errand, okay. And three: they really don’t want you to use social media about it, ’cause then other people might come forward and something might get done. So they sort of villainize you and call you like a social justice or a hashtag warrior. And it’s like, do you guys think that Tarana Burke wanted to start the Me Too movement on Twitter? The same website people use to talk about their Taco Bell diarrhea? I’m thinking no, but her options were limited. And then there will always be somebody who says, women make these claims for attention. And I’m just like, who would want that attention? Like, what are the benefits? Are you imagining these women going to job interviews and saying things like, as you can see on my resume, not only have I been raped, I’ve also been doxed. And I think you’ll find that I work best in ',\n",
              "  'groups rather than one-on-one. And I’m willing to work 24-7 because frankly, I’m terrified to be alone in my apartment. And that’s just a job interview for Taco Bell. So you can imagine, I just, I can’t think of like a celebrity accuser. The only one that comes to mind, I guess, is Lorena Bobbitt, but she didn’t do that for attention. She just got famous for disarming her assailant. I don’t know, maybe arm is generous. Still, if I could choose a superpower, it would be penis 100%. I’m so jealous of your dicks. I want one to have and to hold, but like also on my person, I feel like it’s easier to pee. You can pee anywhere, shape, line, you can spell your name, Jeremy. Is it a Y there at the end? Really let her rip. I also think it’s easier to receive pleasure from a stranger. Like anybody can figure it out. It’s like up down. I think it’s cause your penises are outside of you. Right, you know what I mean. He’s like my dick is out right now. But for me, more of an indoor situation, our bodies are like homes. Some of us more an Airbnb, but we can be, we can be entered. We can be entered. That’s why it’s important to knock or bring a gift. Just because you’ve come over once doesn’t mean you get keys, crazy. But dudes, you have like a fun, quick name for pleasure on the go, it’s blowjob. And then sometimes you shorten that to BJ or like beej. But for me it’s like, can I interest you in performing cunnilingus? It sounds scientific. Even our fun word for it, going down, has a negative connotation. It’s like going down to hell. It’s a little hot down there, but hypothetically, any person in here with a penis could just walk back to the bathrooms, get a quick beej to compleesh, but me, I have to walk back to the bathrooms, make sure that there’s a koala care station. Pull it down. Hoist my body up onto it. Get these overalls off. Buckle myself in, in case it’s good. And then fingers crossed that I showered. No, but truly like if you had a long day at work and then you found out you were going to get intimate with somebody and you didn’t feel fresh, you could just slip away to the bathroom and wash your dick off in the sink. And I hope you do. But for me it’s like, have you ever tried t',\n",
              "  'o gut a pumpkin? There’s a lot of seeds. Is my hand better or a spoon? We can’t be sure it’s clean until we get a candle in here. You’re not going to find me pants-less on the Koala Care. I promise. Frankly, it won’t hold me. I’m definitely more of a relationship person. Like I’m willing to be unhappy with someone for up to three years. I’ve also never been dumped, I’m undefeated. Thank you, oh thank you so much. I tend to go relationship to relationship. I think a professional would call that codependent. I call it college educated, okay. I don’t quit a job before I have another one lined up. My last relationship was very on again, off again. I would break up with him, but it wouldn’t stick. He would convince me that we were soulmates and then later complained you’re always trying to change me. I’m like, yes, exactly. You won’t let me go, I’m making do with what I have. He did have a big penis, he wanted me to tell you guys that. I’m sure he still has it. Everybody acts like that’s a good thing. It always gave me anxiety, especially before sex. I always felt like I was prepping myself for minor outpatient surgery. Just in the way that he’d always say, now you’re going to feel a little bit of light pressure. And then it was over. He’d be like count back from 100, I never got into the eighties. And then afterwards he’d be standing over me like you lost a lot of fluid. I’m like, that was you. He would always go down on me, which you should all be doing, before sex, but he would just go down on me and then he would drool a lot all over my hoot and then look up and say, whoa, you’re so wet. That would be like if I lit the kitchen on fire and then yelled, dinner’s ready. You cannot unlock a lock by just dousing it in WD-40. There’s a key. Sometimes there’s a code. I’m not saying I’m amazing in bed. Like sure, I’ve gotten my 10,000 hours in and I hate to brag, but I can last forever in bed without coming. Hours, weeks, I’ve gone a year. I didn’t even have to think about dead animals or baseball, like I was trying. So I’ve turned to dating younger men, I’m a bit of a coug. Thank you. I like sleeping with younger men because you can use tactics on them in bed that you know work on you',\n",
              "  'nger people. For example, you can be like, let’s see how fast you can do it, I’ll time you. Last one to come’s a rotten egg. I’m kidding, it’s me. All my eggs are rotten, I’m 63. I’ve been dating a guy who’s nine years younger than me. And, when we first started dating, I had like high school feelings for him. And I couldn’t tell whether it was ’cause he was the one or just so recently out of high school. He’s of age, to be clear. I don’t want to creep anybody out. I feel like I’m teaching him a lot about life, love, sober sex. I’m raising a wonderful young man. And he’s teaching me stuff too about memes, it’s mostly memes. I’m haha, he’s more LOL. There’s an age gap. If you are sitting here as a relationship person, you have to be careful because, you know, you end a relationship with this high level of intimacy and when you meet someone new, you have to start over. But it’s very tempting to pick up right where you left off because you can hit it off with a stranger immediately. And you can’t always tell whether it’s passion, or alcoholism, or mental illness. Sometimes it takes a bit for that to roll out. I was once dating this con artist. He would prefer artist. Three months into our relationship, I actually caught him eating one of his boogers. Now, in his defense, there was still like a little bit of cocaine left in it, but it’s a bad sign, you know, when you wish your boyfriend just ate regular boogs. This is sort of when I wish women would talk more, you know, like give each other the review. We keep very separate and that’s where their strength lies. I was warned once, she was just too late, and a woman came up to me after a show and she said, hey, we need to talk. And I thought ruh-roh. She said, I also dated that con artist after you and a little bit during. And she said, he gave me chlamydia. So you might want to go get checked. And then I went and I got checked and I didn’t have it. So I didn’t need to tell you guys any of that. I think my point was I don’t know why I was drawn to this person. Like I barely drink, I’ll have a beer. I’ll take a little toot on the weed horn, absolutely. But hard drugs scare me. Like the closest I’ve come to doing cocaine is just tryin',\n",

Try to get your hand in and out of there without freaking out. Your heart’s gonna race, I guarantee it. Separately, I dated a Russian DJ, naturally, and he had just told me that he was going to stop doing cocaine for me, which meant he was going to stop telling me when he did cocaine. This is one of those like hit it off immediately situations, we’re very into each other and it’s like our fourth date, but I’m trying to keep it light and not latch on too soon. And he looks at me across the table and he says, I haven’t felt this way about a woman in six years. And all I could think was just, who is she? All I need is an Instagram handle, so I can go to her Etsy store and order one of her items and leave a cryptic review I love women. I hate what we do in review sections. I do a lot of online shopping to feel whole and I order many, many items. All of which I send back and I read a ton of reviews ’cause I’m very careful when I waste my time. And I will be on bloomingdales.com, looking at some inordinately expensive T-shirt where a woman has written a review that says I’m five-foot-one, 90 pounds, and swimming in a small. It’s like we get it. You’ve never broken a chair. Just say it runs large, okay. We don’t need your stats, Nina. So after this woman called me fat on the internet, I retaliated and I wrote my own review of the same t-shirt without having purchased it. And my review, I wrote I’m five-foot-nine I graduated magna cum laude. I have a really big one bedroom and I don’t weigh myself, post. 43 people found that helpful. I don’t, I don’t weigh myself. I just ask someone to draw me. And if they reach for a jumbo Sharpie, maybe I dial it back a bit. If I feel like it, I like fluctuating. It keeps it fun, keeps it fresh. I heard it’s good for your heart. I used to weigh myself when I was chubbier, when I was working in the bagel industry. I was in quality control. And when I worked at the bagel shop, I ate too much, too many times, to the point where you could see it on my body. Food is interesting like that, you sho',\n",
              "  'w your work. I put up some of my best numbers at the bagel shop. It was during a time in my life where I thought that cookies might go extinct. My top score was 198 pounds, which, I’m 5-9 as I mentioned, it’s kind of nothing on my frame. You know, 198 is not a wake-up call. That’s a challenge. You’re going to get two pounds away from 200 and not hit it. Go fuck yourself. I did it the next day. No matter what the scale says, I always feel good about myself. I have like reverse body dysmorphia or something. ‘Cause if you don’t know, regular body dysmorphia, it’s when you think you’re fat, but you’re actually stupid. No, there’s other reasons like mothers and being brainwashed by doctored images of other women. since the time we could see. That one’s a little dark, but I keep it in. I guess I wouldn’t have to make jokes about this stuff if women’s worth, weren’t still based on our looks but for some reason it is. Some people know that and they think the highest compliment that they can pay a woman is like, hey, I noticed that you lost weight and you look amazing. And that just fills us up because we are so hungry. And if you think about it, all you’re really saying is like, hey, I noticed that you take up less space and I like it. And we’re like, thank you. Someday, I hope to not even be here. I wish I didn’t remember every negative thing somebody said to me about my body. But it’s the stuff people say to you about your appearance that you remember. If nobody said anything, I would have been fine. Can’t see how big your ass is when you’re trucking straight ahead. I was dating a guy for a while and we went out to eat and we finished the meal. And then I decided to order a cinnamon roll to go, just to feel safe, and he looked at me and he said, I love you, but I don’t think you need that cinnamon roll. For free, nobody there to him to say it. So when we got back to my apartment, he asked, are you mad at me? And I said, yes. And he explained, I was just worried about your health. Now to give it context, he and I had had discussions about how sometimes people who’ve been through trauma have an emotional attachment to food. And that’s true for me. Sometimes being full feels like a hug',\n",
              "  ' from the inside. So while I appreciate his concern, I’d only gain 10 or 15 pounds and you can’t die from a muffin top. Now here’s where he tripped into a light jog out of my life. He decided to add, “It’s just that my therapist told me that I could tell you that I was more attracted to you when you were exercising and eating better.” And I thought, is your therapist your friend Sean? ‘Cause it sounds like Sean, who also called me crazy for making you wash your hands before sex after riding the subway, but I feel like every surgeon has to scrub in, okay. This was all coming from a very thin person and I never asked him to eat more so it didn’t feel like I was trying to snuggle with a jungle gym, or get fucked by a rhombus. That’s a lot of sharp angles coming at me. Whatever, everybody’s health goals are different. Some people’s health goals are just being able to tell what the diarrhea was from. I think we’re finally in a good place where everybody realizes that being fat doesn’t mean you’re unhealthy and being thin doesn’t mean you’re healthy. When I was 200 pounds, I lived with a girl who was a hundred pounds and she would always call herself fat. She was a German shepherd, but like she carried it well. It affects everybody. I know it affects men too. Of course you guys aren’t immune to body image issues, or maybe you have events in mind you’d like to look good for. I remember my sister got married during my bagel years and I made the mistake of comparing myself to one of the other bridesmaids online, which you never want to do, you know it, don’t compare yourself to other people. But I remember thinking I’m going to lose so much weight for this wedding. And then, oh, I didn’t. I just kept being me and I got a last-minute spray tan instead. I just showed up to my sister’s wedding looking insane, just chubby and orange, which at the time was not presidential, okay, this is years prior. Probably started it. I remember one of the other bridesmaids in the party pulled me aside before like the aisle part, and she said, remember Beth, today is about your sister, it’s not about you. I was like, what? I can’t help that I’m pulling focus, okay. I’m orange and I have a dark brown uppe',\n",

I think it’s a beautiful thing, I do. Do you know how hard it is to put yourself out there, over and over again, and be vulnerable enough to fall in love. I’m a full coward. I’m very noncommittal. If I’m ever at the altar and the pastor says, do you, Beth, take this person to be your whatever. If so, say I do. I’m just going to be like, eh, it’s not that I don’t. I just feel weird saying it in front of everybody. Good news is I come from a very pro-divorce family and my older sister and I, we never liked our middle sister’s first husband. He had a Samsung Galaxy. But I was praying that his would explode over his penis. Is that how religion works, I just started. I may have tweeted something to that effect, and he found the tweet, which I appreciate the follow, brother. But he got very upset and he showed the tweet to my sister. And he said, your sister’s tweeting about my dick getting blown off, with like the rage of a man who plays softball. And I am going to save it and I’m going to read it to the kids to sabotage their relationship with Beth. And I was like, whoa, I can’t believe I got him to read to his kids. My sister tried everything. I don’t know if you’ve ever planned a second or third wedding, but stuff starts flying off the truck. You find yourself cutting corners, saying things like, maybe we don’t need to walk down the aisle. We could already be down there. Or who needs a reception, we’ll just meet at the bar. And the dresses change over time. Your first wedding, you’re in a beautiful ball gown. And eventually you end up in a white business suit just like, this time I’m serious. Now of course, marriage can be a beautiful thing. I’m thankful I don’t feel the pressure to do it, but I love watching my sisters do it. I don’t love all the traditions they’ve kept. Like I don’t enjoy the bride sweepstakes, the giveaway part where our dad walks ’em down the aisle in a white dress. And he’s like, here are the untouched goods, you take care of it. It just feels weird, I don’t want my dad giving m',\n",
              "  'e away, like he never had me. I also feel there’s gotta be somebody better suited for the job. I was thinking about it long and hard, and what I came up with was maybe my ex-boyfriend, Nick, will do it, give me away. We had three wonderful years together. I loved him, he loved me. I actually have his name tattooed on my back, so he kind of owes me on this. And I broke up with him, but he’s married now, so maybe he’d like to hear from me. I don’t know. I found out he was married because of Instagram. I still follow his sister, she hasn’t blocked me yet. And she posted this beautiful photo of him and his wife on their wedding day, which I felt like was really in my face. I think if I asked him to do it, he would. And then Nick could walk me down the aisle and we’d get to my almost-husband, and then maybe like one last kiss and then Nick could lean into him and whisper something like there’s a little bit left, you know, or something. I don’t know, I’m workshopping it. I just want somebody to make an honest woman out of me. And then if his wife hates the idea I could offer to get her name tattooed under his. It’s like his name, her name, any children they have, I’m willing to do pets. I should be arrested. I really do have his name tattooed back there. Do you know how hard it is to get laid with another man’s name on your back? Not hard, it isn’t. Never been an issue. Despite everything I’ve said leading up to this point, I do have a relationship with my father. I just called him back yesterday, ’cause he had called me on Father’s Day and I wanted to get back. My parents divorced when I was young and my dad moved down to Orlando, Florida to be an actor, which is not where you go. He did, he eventually landed a role as Blackbeard at Pirate’s Cove mini putt-putt golf course. And when you know celebrities, there are going to be perks. So my two older sisters and I, we would leave our mom in Ohio and go down to Orlando to visit our dad because it was court-ordered. Free putt-putt, baby. My dad would dress like a pirate from here down. And then Alice, the manager at the time, would give my dad this huge Blackbeard head to put on top of his head that rested on his shoulders. And then he',\n",
              "  ' would walk around the mini golf place making people’s time better, question mark. But before my dad’s shift would start and before we ran off, he would pull us aside after we picked out our clubs and he’d gather us around and he’d get very serious and he’d be like, girls, listen up, get over here. Look at me. Listen. When the head goes on, look at me. When the head goes on. I’m not dad anymore. Very method, okay, which from one artist to another, I respected, but I was also the youngest of the three girls. You know when your sisters tell you to shut up? And then two seconds later you’re like, as we go on, we remember, and then they hit you and you’re like, I’m sorry. I forgot, seriously I forgot. So I did, I forgot. And I got a little hole in one and I started yelling for my dad instead of Blackbeard. And he found where the sound was coming from in the head, he was like at a higher hole. And he peeked around this blue waterfall and just looked down at us and shook the whole head, like no. I don’t know if you’ve ever disappointed a parent that has a bigger head on top of their head, but it’s like triple the disappointment. And also a little passive-aggressive, ’cause there’s like a huge smile on the outside of the face, But not on the inside. After that, he could have gone anywhere, Disney, Universal, the mall, but he bucked industry standards and he started his own business that’s called Stars on Call. He describes his work as live roadside commercials or like character directionals. He dresses up in different costumes and he stands in front of businesses that are paying them to get people inside. I’m sure you have people like that here, right? It’s usually like a kid in front of Subway sandwiches with a sign and earbuds and like, fuck my life. My dad blows those assholes out of the water. He’s out there high-kicking. He’s pelvic thrusting. There’s a lot of raising the roof. He’s a leprechaun in front of this Irish pub called the Carry Him In. He’s a gorilla in front of Gold’s Gym. He’s a slice of pizza. Has anyone seen my dad? In the Orlando area? Real question, I like to ask, ’cause one time I think I was in Houston, a guy went, yo, is your dad, the fireman in front of Fire',\n",
              "  'house Subs. And I was like, yes, that’s my maker. He also does a fairly offensive portrayal of a Mexican in front of this place called Tijuana Flats, but he’s been doing it for 29 years, so at this point it is on them. If you call my dad’s number, he’ll answer and he’ll be like Stars on Call, this is Bert. Yeah, you want Chef Big Butt from three to five? No problem, I’ll send a man out. Always him. Nobody else works for that company. He’s a genius. I guess technically his wife. He found somebody to marry him down in Orlando and sometimes she’ll zip up his morph suit. As kids always felt like on our visits, my dad would like consistently choose our stepmom over me and my sisters, and like, I get it. You know, she gave him head and all we had were questions. But my dad has been in Orlando now for so long his personality is very much Fox news. Like, I mean, he’s so MAGA, he’s stealing jobs from the Mexicans. Growing up, we’d have these weekly calls that you have with your divorced parents and he would spew a fairly feminist rhetoric. He would always say, girls, remember to get the education you need to get the job you need, to get the car and the house you need. Then worry about the husband. And then in high school he started calling us and saying things like, if you ever get pregnant, I’ll take the baby. What? I don’t think he meant steal it, I think he meant take it and raise it. I wish more anti-choice people were like him. Like if you have it, I’ll take it. But they’re not, they just want you to have it. And then you never hear from ’em again. No thank you note, no money, it’s rude. I’m sure you’re wondering how hard it must’ve been for my mom to watch my dad go off and become a big star… on call, none-the-less. She’s fine. She’s currently sleeping with this very handsome, cavalier King Charles spaniel. His name is Nigel. She loves him. I feel like all he does is just try to eat her food and put his dick on our good pillows. I’ve been replaced. She sort of… She likes to update me on what they’re up to if they’re hanging and stuff. One time she sent me a photo of Nigel on the front porch. You know when a dog like splays their back legs out equally. So the hind is like, peuwww,',\n",
              "  ' you know what I mean? I better do it. Sorta like, when the dog is like fully flat, just like you know what I mean, it’s like penis to pavement, just like cooling his dick off on the cement. My mom sent me a photo of Nigel like this on the front porch, in the caption she wrote, it’s pretty hot here. I was like, ew. Is this a sext? Is this Nigel? My mom… Can you just imagine the dog, like ticka-ticka-tick… My mom has been out of the game for a while. I took her on a retirement trip and we were out to eat, we must have run out of things to talk about ’cause at the end of the meal I asked my mom, have you ever gotten a dick pic? She goes a nickel? I was like, what? Never mind, I don’t know why I even asked you that. Is anybody here with their mom? Oh you, good, I love it when people come with their mom, especially if I talk about something sexual, it’s so fun to look at you guys, because you’re usually like, I don’t know, are we laughing? Which I chalk up to like a sexual spectrum of mother, how moms raise their kid in regard to sex. ‘Cause on one side of the sexual spectrum, some moms are like, sex does not exist. And then their kids go away to college and they’re like, yes it does. And then there are moms on the opposite side of the sexual spectrum who say things like, hi honey, how was your orgasm? And you’re like, ew. I will not be coming home for Thanksgiving. Thankfully I didn’t have to deal with that. My mom is 100% a virgin. When she does start dating, I’m going to have to ask her like, how was your date? And then she’ll say, I don’t know, we were kissing, and then his penis got sharp. I don’t have to explain it to my mom. My sisters, on the other hand, love to bone. They like to have sex, get fertilized, wait for it to go from embryo, to fetus, to baby. And then they birth the baby. It’s like their thing. Whenever my oldest sister’s pregnant, her husband likes to announce it, and he’ll always say, “We’re pregnant!” Which has historically irked some people because they feel like the woman is doing a lot of the heavy lifting. I, however, have turned a corner and I like it, I do. ‘Cause it did, it took two people to do that thing, which is why I like to practice with all th',\n",
              "  'e men in my crowd before we go. I just like to practice saying we’re pregnant on three. So all the men in the crowd on three, we’ll say, “we’re pregnant.” One, two, three. We’re pregnant. Okay, you’re also drunk. Not everybody did it. If that didn’t resonate with you, I guess you could just go home and practice. We’re aborting. That’s honestly where we could use your help the most. For some reason, the stigma of abortion is just fully on a woman, it’s bonkers. Back where I’m from in Ohio, they were talking about putting a woman in prison if she gets an abortion and I’m like, eh, she had an accomplice. We haven’t had a Mary since that first one. And even then you’re telling me that God stopped at one kid. The self-restraint there is admirable. Like God just had Jesus and then we lost him. You think he’d try again. I just feel like mortal men, sometimes it feels like mortal men, you’re more careful pouring a beer than you are with your jizz. Just like, ooh, ooh, not too much head. It is like the only time you say that. And then privately you’re just spreading biomedical hazard, like…gooogggg I don’t blame you. Nobody teaches enough about this stuff. Some people don’t even like hearing the word abortion. But as long as birth control is hard for a lot of people to get and boners are hard to keep in condoms, they’re going to happen. I think we just got to stop looking at abortion like leftovers. Hear me out, keep breathing through the joke. Imagine it like this. Like a couple goes out for a big meal and they over-order, they’re reckless, they’re probably wasted. And at the end of the meal, there’s a bunch of leftovers and the dude says, you take them. And the woman says, oh, I don’t want them, you take them. And the dude says I can’t, I don’t have a fridge. And she asks then why did you put it in the box? You shouldn’t have put it in the box. Now we’re going to have to throw it away. And the dude says, “Okay, do you want me to like walk you to a trash can?” And then for some reason on the way to the trash can, there’s only random people yelling at her, like, “You wasteful bitch!” She’s like, what, he paid for half? I’m just saying abortion is not really the time to go Dutch, maybe ',\n",
              "  'treat her. And of course there’s a lot of good men out there. I was living in Bloomington, Indiana, and I saw a man praying in front of the Planned Parenthood. And I imagined that he was just saying like, dear God, please make sure that Brenda came here on Wednesday when she said she would. So there’s some good ones. Whenever my sisters are pregnant at the same time– like that’s happened simultaneously a couple times– people can’t help themselves, they always ask me like, did they plan it? I’m just like what does that look like for you? Do you think one of my sisters called the other and said, hey, what’s up, what are you doing? And the other was like, I don’t know, what are you doing? No. I don’t know what the season is for unprotected sex, but I think it’s always in Ohio. I have so many nieces and nephews running around, I can’t keep track. Sometimes I just have to wait for them to like play in a group, and then I shout out a name like, “Charlotte” and wait for one to turn. Get over here, let’s connect. I don’t even know what I would name kids if I had them. Obviously Jeremy, your parents struggled. I had a friend who actually named their daughter Harbor because she and her husband conceived her in this beautiful hotel in a harbor, which is truly disturbing. If my family did that, we would have so many Alleys and Sofas. Maybe like one The Woods, I’m from Ohio. And then what, they’re just supposed to call me mom? There’s already so many. I didn’t even know my mom had a first name until recently. I’d just been calling her mom for so long. And then she phoned me up and asked why haven’t you followed me back on Instagram? I was like, who’s Diane? I don’t even know if I would respond to mom. I’ve been called a female comic Ss many times I’d respond better to girl daddy. Just imagine my future imaginary son, like the last to get picked up, at probably afternoon kindergarten. And his teacher walks over to him and asks, Van, is your mother coming? And then he’ll be like, no, my girl dad is, she’s just always late. She’s probably picking up my sister, Shallow Grave. You guys have been so great. Thank you for listening.

But a pandemic is what we ultimately got. Which was rock and roll, normal and cool. The last year was absolutely exquisite. I gained a lot of weight over the last year, which isn’t good or bad.

But I can officially titty fuck my… Don’t you sometimes wish there were different words for things? But now my tits are big enough that I can wrap ’em ’round my boyfriend’s cock. Did you think… Be honest. Did you think you’d hear “cock” this early in the show? Cock is such a porny word. I famously love porn, if my boyfriend tells me the girl looks like me. Otherwise, it is bad for women. And that’s just where I stand on that issue. So, I was, for the last time, titty fucking my boyfriend. Humble brag. And… when he came… [clicks tongue] Yeah.

I have a rare disease where if I read a book, the whole time I’m looking at it, I’m like, [chuckles] “Look at you. Reading a book.” “You stupid, stupid slut.” Just ’cause I don’t like to read, write, argue or be alone, doesn’t mean I’m not an intellectual. [cheering] That’s my crowd work. I actually won a very prestigious award lately. Hold for applause. I won an award for leaving my home without my phone for 42 minutes. Yeah. Thank you. And, no, and that’s not why I do it. And that’s not why I do it. When I did that, I had what critics and fans alike are calling “a lady in a movie moment.” “What’s that? What’s that? What could that possibly be? What is that?” So, “a lady in a movie moment” is when something happens to you that might happen to a lady in a movie. So, for example, if you, um… if you check the mail with your little key… Lady in a movie. [laughter] If you hold a baguette… If you’re even near a baguette… Lady in a movie. And if you, say it with me, run into your ex on the street, that is full-blown, hundy p, lady in a… [audience] Lady in a movie. Thank you. Oh! It feels good to be at home. So, I did recently, like a cartoon, have a lady in a movie moment. I ran into my ex on the street. [scoffs] And he was wearing a suit. He looked incredible. Which is, as we know, illegal. And I was wearing… What’s it called when you, like, don’t shave your legs for three months and then you shave ’em really quick and there’s blood everywhere? [audience laughs] So, I was wearing that. And we ran into each other, and he’s one of these people who uses your name in a sentence. It’s like… Whoa. [chuckles] If you use my name in a sentence, you need to either fuck me or kill me. There’s no in-between. On this occasion, he kind of chose to do neither, which was, of course, a power move and not at all related to how he feels about me. I’m sorry. I just choked on my own human tongue. Breakups are cool. Right? I’m a guy’s girl. Breakups are cool. Breakups are freaking sick. Breakups are cool because it’s like you have a best friend and then they die.

And all I think is, “I am so glad that’s not my job.” So, thankfully, I live by myself now. When I first moved into my own apartment, I fully developed a, say it with me, new personality. I have a lot of new traits now. I recently went to a Chipotle at 10:45 a.m. Doctor’s orders. And when I walked in, I was like… ‘Cause I’m cool. When I walk into Chipotle… Up here, I’m all… At Chipotle, I get it. I’m like… [audience laughing] [smacks lips] I walk into a Chipotle and the guy working there… Yes, a man. Important for the story. He’s like, “What do you want?” And I’m like, “Okay. He wants to have raw dog sex with me.” No. I say, “Hello. I would like a chicken burrito bowl.” “I know guac is extra and I’ll take the hottest sauce.” He goes, “[scoffs] You sure?” [moans] I was like, “Oh, my God.” [in young girl voice] “Am I sure?” Mmm… “I don’t know.” “I never thought about that before.” [smacks lips] “I don’t think about big boy questions like that.” “I’m just a little girly.” “I think about little girly things like earrings.” “And shoes. I don’t know about big boy stuff like that.” “I’m just a little baby with titties.” [in normal voice] Oh, I’m sorry. I just completely blacked out. Did I do something? Wait, did I say something annoying? I don’t think we should kill all the men. Hold for applause.',\n",

I don’t care about movies that are about, like, sand… or rope, or space. The only kind of movies I want to watch are where a woman looks at herself in her medicine cabinet mirror and says… [in deep voice] “Hello, stranger.” [in normal voice] That’s kind of the genre that works for me. That being said, I do wanna be the first person in a Marvel movie who’s never seen a Marvel movie. So, DM me. You know, it’s sad. I do have a hard time with men, but even I… Even I can’t resist.

I think ’cause I’m conventionally attractive and… [audience laughs] I didn’t love it because Critter was shortened to “Crit.” To me, that sounded a lot like “Clit.” And I was like, “What’s happening with my one life?” But… Honestly, now, like, I am a lot like a clit. I’m extremely sensitive, I love to be touched, and straight guys just don’t know what to do with me. Sometimes they want to fuck me, and sometimes they think I’m like a fun aunt ’cause my energy is like… [hums] And I’m always at restaurants moaning along when the waiter tells me the specials. I’m always like, “Mmm, risotto.” Mmm. ‘Cause it’s always a mushroom risotto. Fuck yes! [audience] Whoo! Wow! That mushroom risotto joke is an absolute banger. Um… Thank you so much. Have a great night. No. You wish. You sick fucks. But I got more to give. I actually was supposed to go to my ten-year high school reunion recently. But I couldn’t go because I was, um, jerking off on the floor of my apartment. “Why the floor? Why the floor? Why the floor?” I was too lazy to close the window curtain that looks into the bed. So, I was like, “Floor it is.” And I think everyone here knows, but I do actually have a mirrored armoire in my bedroom. If you don’t know what an armoire is, now would be an awesome time to leave the show. [audience laughs] Thank you. Bye. So I’m jerking off on the floor. And the way I do it is beached-whale style, which means I just lay on my hand and [trills] away. And when I looked up into my mirrored armoire, I saw something I really wouldn’t wish on anyone. I saw… [chuckles] in its organic, hardy, grass-fed, natural state… my O face. Without the performance of sex, the pressure of another, I saw what I looked like when I cum, which is… [audience laughing] So, when I cum, this is actually my O face. I don’t want to be like this. By the way, if my face was symmetrical, I would not be up here doing this shit. Goes without saying, I don’t want to be this way. I want to be the kind of girl who just wears jeans. I wish I could do… You know when people do that? I can’t jump even a little. This is literally me jumping as high as I can.

[sighs] Just clutch it and stare at it and be like, “I get this.” [audience laughs] I want to be the kind of woman who’s out to lunch with friends, she’s draped in silks, draped in silks, draped in silks. The restaurant, of course, white tablecloth, white tablecloth. And she starts to laugh because she remembers something funny, a memory maybe. But before she does, she stops herself. She says… [laughing] “I was in love once.” So that’s the kind of girl I want to be. But I have career goals too. [woman] Whoo! Girl boss. Um, I really, really… And this is serious. This is off the record. I really want to wear a bonnet on screen. Does anyone have one? I have such a face for hats. I have the world’s roundest face. Thank you. No. Don’t all stand up at once. I really want to wear a bonnet on screen. Um… And then my second career goal is I want to be in a film where I’m going on a first date, and as I’m kissing my suitor goodnight, I close the door shut to my apartment, and then I turn around and I just… Yes. I slide against that door. I hooked up with a guy I met on a first date once ’cause I’m a slut. Take back the word. And mid-moment, he was like, “Oh, yeah. I love that fat, fat ass.” And I was like… “Maybe one fat was enough.” [audience laughs] I do. I do. I… I know. I gravely want to be thin because of society. [playing piano] Because thin privilege is real. If you’re thin… This is my ideal body type. If you’re thin, you can be famous for smoking a cigarette and looking sad. If you’re fat and there’s a photo of you smoking a cigarette and looking sad, it’s a campaign for something. It’s some D.A.R.E. shit. You know what I mean?

And it read, “Couple fucks themselves off side of cliff.” Where were you? When you found out? How you were going to die? Because for me, I was like, “Oh, that’s an option.” [audience laughs] I love fuck. I have some sexual fantasies I want to share with you all. My first sexual fantasy is that I’m in a mahogany room. Built-in bookcases. Built-in bookcases. Built-in bookcases. And I’m sitting in a velvet wingback chair. And I put my ring finger to my temple and I just say, “Ugh. I worry. I do.” [audience laughs] And then my other sexual fantasy is that he makes me cum, damn it. Am I right, ladies? Is that a lot to ask? Honey, I’m looking for a guy tall enough that I don’t have to get on my knees when I want to blow him. That’s right. I want to stand up, dick should be here. [audience laughs] I hooked up with… [chuckles] I hooked up with this guy I met at a bar because I’m brave, and he was like, “I actually biked to this bar. I can bike us back to my place.” “You can ride on my pegs.” And I was like, [in British accent] “Absolutely not.” [smacks lips] [audience laughs] [in normal voice] He was like, “No. it’s okay. It can hold 120 pounds.” And I was like, “Okay, you don’t know what math is. You are my type.” [audience laughs] I just feel like it’s like every chubby girl’s nightmare to be carried in a playful way. Like, I’m pretty sure when I was born, the nurse, like, picked me up and handed me to my mom, and I was like, “It’s okay. You can put me down.” [audience laughs] It’s sad. After I slept with him, I woke up with a, say it with me, bump on my pussy. Just lucky, I guess. Foot pop, j’adore. And I was like, “Great. I need to reach out to my gynecologist about this.” So, I had to access her through, say it with me, The Portal. [audience laughs] I’m s… Why are doctors absolutely, clinically addicted to making you enter through a portal? It’s like… “I’m here.” It’s like, “Can I just get an email or…” They want you to be like… [audience laughs] They want you to be full Narnia vibes to talk to them abo\",\n",

We don’t have to… We don’t have to… I don’t need anything with wings. Bitch, I have ’em. Oh, my God. So, I was like, “I need to take a picture of this to send to my gynecologist.” So, I went into my studio, which is obviously an empty room with a full-size mattress on the floor. And I took out my camera, which is obviously an iPhone rose gold Plus with a cracked screen, ’cause I’m fun. Spread my lips and I took an image. I wish that were the end of the story. I’m going to do a lap. When I looked at that image, um… Are you okay to hear this? Ally. [audience laughs] Feminist ally. When I looked at the image, it was one of the most harrowing things I’ve ever seen. One, I used flash. Rookie mistake. Two, I didn’t understand the reach of my camera. So, when I looked at the picture, I didn’t only see my spread pussy lips, which I expected. But, in the background, I saw what can only be described as my dead-eyed face. [audience laughs] No expression. Just a corpse’s head, really. So, I had to crop that out for legal reasons. And when I sent it to my gyne, she was like, “There’s nothing wrong with you.” I know there’s a long history of doctors not believing women, but in my case, doctors shouldn’t believe me because I’m what many medical professionals have called a dumbass bitch.

Two, you are losing hair on your head, but, three, you have hair on your face, and four, you have acne.

Especially as women. Especially in this industry. We have to learn to stop apologizing and just say, “Yeah.

Stan Lathan, who directed Chappelle’s six other specials for the streamer, returns to direct “The Dreamer.” Chappelle’s previous Netflix specials include “The Age of Spin” (2017), “Deep in the Heart of Texas” (2017), “Equanimity” (2017), “The Bird Revelation” (2017), “Sticks & Stones” (2019) and “The Closer” (2021). “Dave Chappelle: The Dreamer” premiered globally on Netflix December 31, 2023 \\xa0The trailer, published by Netflix on December 25, 2023, is narrated by Morgan Freeman, who also makes an appearance alongside Chappelle. “What do you dream about? Not the dreams you have in your sleep: the ones you hold in your heart. Don’t be intimidated by the audacity of your dream — be inspired by it,” Freeman says in the trailer. “What happens to a dream deferred? Lucky for Dave, he doesn’t know.” Unchanged: “What do you dream about? Not the dreams you have in your sleep: the ones you hold in your heart. Don’t be intimidated by the audacity of your dream — be inspired by it,” Freeman says in the trailer. “What happens to a dream deferred? Lucky for Dave, he doesn’t know.” Watch the trailer below. * * * In a deeply reflective and often humorous monologue, Dave Chappelle recounts his journey from a struggling comedian handing out tickets on the avenue to a celebrated artist returning to the stage 24 years after his first HBO special, Killin’ Them Softly. He shares personal anecdotes, including the influence of his late artistic father and comedian Norm MacDonald, and his encounter with Jim Carrey. Chappelle addresses the controversies surrounding his jokes about the transgender community, asserting his decision to pivot from such material while wryly introducing a new target: the handicapped. He recounts an assault at the Hollywood Bowl, weaving in a narrative about his friend and fellow comedian Chris Rock, who experienced a similar public altercation. Chappelle draws parallels between their ',\n",

He shares insights into his marriage, the surreal aspects of fame, and the complex interplay of identity and public persona.

He leaves the audience with a reminder of the fluidity and shared nature of dreams, asserting his place in the world with a sense of both humility and command. * * * “IF ONE ADVANCES CONFIDENTLY IN THE DIRECTION OF HIS DREAMS,\\nAND ENDEAVORS TO LIVE THE LIFE WHICH HE HAS IMAGINED,\\nHE WILL MEET WITH A SUCCESS UNEXPECTED IN COMMON HOURS.” – Henry David Thoreau DAVE CHAPPELLE LIVE FROM WASHINGTON, D.C. THE\\nDREAMER [audience cheering and applauding] [audience cheering] [Dave] All right. Almost 24 years ago… it was the last time I was on the stage in this room. [audience cheering] I was taping my first one-hour special. It was called Killin’ Them Softly. My girlfriend was sitting in that row, pregnant. She’s now my wife. The baby that she was carrying, my first child… I smoke weed with that n*gga now… And what I remember most about that night was the pressure. Before the show, I had to run out on the avenue and hand out tickets to anybody who would take ’em ’cause I couldn’t even fill the fucking room. And, boy, what a difference 24 short years makes. And right before that time, my father had died. He never lived to see me do it. And when he died, I was inconsolable. I thought I’d never smile or laugh again. And the only thing that got me out of that space was a comedian friend of mine, the late, great Norm MacDonald. That’s right, shout out for Norm. And what Norm did, which I’ll never forget, as he knew that I was the biggest Jim Carrey fan in the world. I’m not gonna go into it, but Jim Carrey is talented in a way that you can’t practice or rehearse. What a God-given talent. I was fascinated with him. And Norm knew that. He called me up, and he goes, “Dave, I’m…” He says, “I',\n",
              "  '’m doing a movie with Jim Carrey…” “Do you want to meet him?” And I said, “Fuck, yes, I do.” It was the first time I could remember, since my father died, being excited. And the movie was called Man on the Moon. I didn’t know any of this. In this movie, Jim Carrey was playing another comedian I admired. The late, great Andy Kaufman. Yes, and Jim Carrey was so immersed in that role, that from the moment he woke up, to the time he went to bed at night, he would live his life as Andy Kaufman. I didn’t know that. When they said, “Cut,” this n*gga was still… Andy Kaufman. So much so that everybody on the crew called him Andy. I didn’t know that. I just went to meet him. When he walked into the room we were to meet, I screamed, “Jim Carrey!” And everyone said, “No!” “Call him Andy.” And I didn’t understand. He came over and was acting weird. I didn’t know he was acting like Kaufman. Just like, “Hey, how you doing?” And I was like, “Hello… Andy?” Now… in hindsight, how fucking lucky am I that I got to see one of the greatest artists of my time immersed in one of his most challenging processes ever? Very lucky to have seen that. But as it was happening… I was very disappointed. Because I wanted to meet Jim Carrey, and I had to pretend this n*gga was Andy Kaufman… all afternoon. It was clearly Jim Carrey. I could look at him and I could see he was Jim Carrey. Anyway, I say all that to say… that’s how trans people make me feel. Here we go. Now, if you guys came here to this show tonight… thinking that I’m gonna make fun of those people again, you’ve come to the wrong show. I’m not fucking with those people anymore. It wasn’t worth the trouble. I ain’t saying shit about trans people. Maybe three or four times tonight, but that is it. Tired of talking about them. You wanna know why I’m tired of talking about ’em? Because these people acted like I needed them to be funny. Well, that’s ridiculous. I don’t need you. I’ve got a whole new angle. You guys will never see this shit coming. I ain’t doing trans jokes no more. Know what I’mma do tonigh',\n",
              "  't? Tonight… I’m doing all handicapped jokes. Well, they’re not as organized as the gays. And I love punching down. There’s probably a handicap in the back right now ’cause that’s where they make them sit. “I came here to laugh at transgender people.” “I didn’t know this n*gga was gonna make jokes about us.” “Come on, y’all, let’s get the fuck up out of here.” Yeah, it’s about time somebody let these handicaps have it. N*gga met their match tonight. Fuck ’em. One time I was on Capitol Hill, and I seen a handicapped congressman. Madison Cawthorn, that’s his name. [woman] Oh! He’s a Republican from North Carolina. And he was shocked ’cause I saw him and I go, “Hello, Congressman.” He didn’t even know I knew who he was. He turned… Then I just walked away. I wanted him to see me do something he couldn’t do. I skipped. That n*gga was mad. He’s no longer a congressman. I don’t know if you follow politics. I’m not trying to be funny, but he lost his seat… He ran a bad race. Oh, buddy, yes, he did. You know what he did wrong? He was running for Congress again, and this motherfucker tried to be controversial. He was on all them right wing podcast talking all that shit. He was like, “Washington is worse than Hollywood.” I was at home, like, “What?” He said, “These people are disgusting. They have orgies and sex parties and drug parties.” And I was thinking, “This n*gga sounds like Juicy Smoo-yay.” He’s lying! Now, I don’t doubt that they do this kind of shit in Washington, but I doubt he’s seen it with his own eyes. Because who the fuck invites a paraplegic to an orgy? So this n*gga can roll around and snitch on everybody? [mouthing] I said there’s only one reason you gonna invite him to an orgy. And you know what that is. “Have at it, guys, I can’t feel anything. Let’s get this bill passed for America. One at a time, folks! Oh, buddy. Yep, yep, yep. The other handicaps are the new people I punch down on. To be honest with you, I’ve been trying to repair my relationship with the transgender community. ‘Cause I don’t want them to think that ',\n",
              "  \"I don’t like them. You know how I’ve been repairing it? I wrote a play. I did. ‘Cause I know that gays love plays. It’s a very sad play, but it’s moving. It’s about a Black transgender woman whose pronoun is, sadly, n*gga… It’s a tear-jerker. At the end of the play, she dies of loneliness ’cause white liberals don’t know how to speak to her. Sad… Speaking of n*gga… I’ve also been working on a book, and this is true. I’m rewriting the American Classic, Huckleberry Finn, from N*gger Jim’s perspective. It’s called The Adventures of N*gger Jim. That’s how the book starts. Huckleberry Finn walks up to him and goes, “You’re N*gger Jim.” And he’s like, “Yo, I just said ‘Jim.'” “What’s your name, little buddy?” “Huckleberry Finn is my name.” “What? Huckleberry? That’s your real name?” “God-given.” [exhales] “You know what? Just call me N*gger Jim, it’s fine.” I don’t care if you are Black or White or whatever. If you ever meet a white person named Huckleberry, he has less money than you. That is the white trashiest name I’ve ever heard in my fucking life. If you have a name like Huckleberry, you’re doomed to fail. If I was in court and my lawyer came up like, “I am your attorney, Huckleberry Finn.” I’d be like, “Uh-oh, I’m going to jail.” God forbid I ever go to jail. But if I do, I hope it’s in California. ‘Cause soon as the judge sentence me, I’ll be like, “Before you sentence me, I want the court to know… I identify as a woman. Send me… to a woman’s jail.” As soon I get in there, you know what I’mma be doing. “Give me your fruit cocktail, bitch, before I knock your motherf*cking teeth out. I’m a girl, just like you, bitch. Come here and suck this girl’s dick I got. Don’t make me explain myself. I’m a girl” You know, I have a great reputation in show business, but in comedy, I’m what’s known as a lazy comedian. Which is crazy ’cause I work all the time, but that’s not why they call me lazy. They call me lazy ’cause I do shows sometimes… Twenty thousand people be in the crowd, and I’ll tell a joke, and they’ll all look at me like I’m cr\",\n",
              "  'azy. But three or four people will laugh really hard. And I’ll be on stage like, “Yeah, that’s good enough.” Well, this next joke is one of those jokes that… You know what I mean? I like to tell it, but it never does good. But I’m gonna do it. Know what I don’t do good? I’m not good at impressions, but this is an impression. You ready? Okay. This is not gonna work. A’ight, this is my impression. It’s my impression… [exhales] of the dead people on the Titanic… You didn’t let me finish. This is my impression of the dead people on the Titanic, as the submersible was approaching their ship. That’s good enough. All right, here it goes. I… Okay, here it goes. [trilling voice] Come join us in our watery grave. [normal voice] Oh, buddy, that’s funny to me. Listen, that is a funny way to die. Twenty years from now, on my 70th birthday, I’m gonna take a submersible to see the submersible. Hopefully, by then it should work. My wife hates that joke. You know… Do you know there’s a strip club in D.C. called Camelot? [audience whooping] Is that still open? [audience] Yes! I know what I’m doing after the show. I gotta tell you… the other day, my wife called me creepy. You know, I frequent strip clubs. It’s something I like to do. And my wife said I was creepy ’cause I go to strip clubs by myself. Is that creepy? I think that’s better than going with the fellas. That’s creepy to me. “Hey, let’s all go to the strip club and get our dicks hard together as a group of friends. Drive home in a quiet car and not talk about any of the things we’ve seen or done.” No, n*gga, I go by myself. But my wife doesn’t understand why I go to the strip club. It has nothing to do with sex. I need a pinch of sexual energy in the room to relax, but it’s more about being out. I like the music. A few naked chicks in there makes me feel good, but I’m not trying to socialize or meet anybody. You know, sometimes I go to a strip club and I bring a book. I do, and I sit right by the stage ’cause the reading light is better. [mouthing] One time I went to a strip club, and th',\n",
              "  'is is weird, I don’t know why… The stripper, for some reason, told me her real name. I know. So I left. She didn’t understand. She’s like, “Where are you going?” I was like, “Good night, Deborah.” God bless her, but my wife is mistaken about my life. She told me once she thinks my job is fun. My job is a job. I’m fun. It’s too dangerous, man. You know, all last year… I was touring with, arguably one of the greatest, if not the greatest living comedian, Chris Rock. Me and him toured all year last year. And right before that tour started, Chris was involved in what we Blacks might even consider a goddamn 9/11. Chris got slapped in the face at the Oscars… by Will Smith, which was one of the craziest things I’d ever seen. In fact, if you watch it live on television, like I did, when it happened, I thought it was fake. I did, and I wasn’t sure. So, I waited ’cause unlike you, I know Chris. I waited 30, 40 minutes. As long as it’ll take him to get to another party. And I called him on FaceTime and he picked up. Soon as he picked up, he said, “Yous the only n*gga I’d answer the phone for.” Apparently, Obama and Oprah, everybody called this n*gga to see if everything’s all right… And I thought it was fake. I didn’t know. So I asked. I go, “Well, you know.” He said, “What?” I said, “Did it hurt?” He said, “Yes, n*gga, it hurt.” And then I knew that it was real. And then, and only then, was I offended. I wasn’t just offended he got slapped. That was only half of it. The offensive part was after he slapped him, Will just sat down and enjoyed the rest of his evening. It was crazy. He was… [mouthing] “Thank you.” What the fuck is this? And then all year we was touring, and I couldn’t wait to see what he was going to say in his special about this slap. I told him all year, but the night he taped his special… Chris is one of these guys who’s crafty. You never know what he’s gonna say until he says it. I went to see him tape his special. He taped it up the street, in Baltimore. Now, you guys are from D.C., so you know about Baltimore? We all kno',\n",
              "  'w that through the years, D.C. has been through some very, very tough times. Sadly, Baltimore is still in a very tough time. Not everybody in the world really can understand the depth of Baltimore. Baltimore is so desperate that… Tupac and his mother moved from Baltimore to Oakland for a better life. And Chris Rock went so hard on the paint. And I can’t believe he did this. He shocked a Baltimore crowd. I didn’t know that was possible. I started doing comedy here. Shocked ’em. And you know what he said that got ’em? He looked at the crowd… I didn’t expect him to say this. He looked the crowds. All Black. Baltimore Black… Even if you rich and Black in Baltimore, you know them n*ggas is traumatized about something. Chris shocked them. This is what he said. He went to that crowd. He said… “I refuse to be a victim.” The crowd said… [gasps] And I was backstage looking like, “N*gga watch the tape.” I know it’s fucked up, but I tell you the truth, you know, everything’s funny. Everything’s funny ’til it happens to you. Three months. A mere three months after that terrible attack that Chris Rock endured… I was on stage at the Hollywood Bowl. And a lunatic… jumped out of the crowd and attacked me. I got to tell you, if it happens to you, you don’t know what happened. It was like slow motion. I don’t know this n*gga… I just looked and said, “Oh, my God. I’m being attacked.” And this motherfucker was ragged. He jumped me like, “Aah!” I’m old, but I’m fast. I caught this motherfucker’s head with my hand and pulled his hoodie over his eyes. I can still feel his head in my hand. It was spongy. He had been growing dreadlocks. Not the beautiful dreads that Rastafarians grow. These were accidental L.A. homeless dreads. This shit had leaves and sticks and bottle caps and shit in it. Some kind of grease. I was like, “Ugh!” Like this. And then I fell down. He knocked me all the way on the ground. I was like, “Man, this is a bad situation. I don’t know if I’m going to die or what’s gonna happen.” But in that moment of vulnerability, you know what occ',\n",
              "  'urred to me that it never occurred to me before in my life? In that moment, it occurred to me that bodyguards… should not wear dress shoes to work! Travis! This n*gga, Travis, came out slipping and sliding in some kind of beautiful loafer and fell flat on the back. I said, “Oh, my God. Now both of us are down. I gotta handle this shit myself.” I popped right back… And the kid that knocked me down, he popped up. And we looked at each other and realized, same time, I was bigger than him. And that motherfucker took off running. I started to chase him, and I said, “Eh, fuck him.” I picked the microphone up. Said, “I’m gonna finish this show now.” That’s right. For three months before that, I had been making fun of Chris Rock. And people would ask me all the time. They say, “Dave, what would you do if you were Chris Rock and Will Smith slapped you in the face?” And to this day, the answer is the same. “I don’t know what I would have done.” I’ve never been in a situation that extreme. But I do know now what Will Smith would not have done. And that is, enjoy the rest of his evening. Man, listen. We gave that kid a good wallop. We was whooping his ass. Not “we.” I was on stage trying to think of a joke to tell, but they was beating this n*gga up right behind me. Everybody could see it. Everybody could see it. I’m sitting up there trying to think of what to say. I’m tongue tied. Me, of all people, can’t think of anything to say. Look at my karma. Just that moment, of all the people in the world, Chris Rock walks from backstage. Walks up to me in front of 20,000 people, grabs the mic out of my hands and looks at the crowd and goes, “Was that Will Smith?” Man, motherfuckers fell out of their chairs, laughing. I was standing there looking stupid. I was fucking furious. ‘Cause I’m thinking in my mind, “N*gga, this is my attack. You got attacked three months ago. Now you have jokes?” So, I snatched the mic back from Chris and tried to get one off, but my shit did not go good at all. I didn’t know… I was like, “It was a trans man.” And the crow',\n",
              "  'd was like… “Boo. This is L.A., we like trans people. Boo.” I know, I felt so bad. I felt so bad. But I know why he did it. You’d have to be there to understand, but, man, when that guy tackled me, it was like a movie or something. You gotta picture this. Picture a famous person you like. Every famous person you could imagine was at that show. It was, like, the biggest night that Hollywood had ever seen. And when that guy tackled me, he cleared the bleachers. I had to watch the tape afterwards to know this happened, but as soon as he tackled me, Jamie Foxx was the first motherfucker that jumped out of the crowd. He was wearing a white cowboy hat, like, he knew this shit was going to happen. Never seen this n*gga in a cowboy hat before. And Jamie started chasing that motherfucker around like Any Given Sunday. And that kid was fast. His shit was juking and shaking. And it broke Jamie’s ankles, and he just kept running. Then Jon Stewart, from the Daily Show, ran from backstage and jumped at this motherfucker like Super Jew. He was, like… The kid’s seen Jon coming, so he jumped back and Jon went flying that way. This kid was fast. Then he turned around, he sees the emergency exit, he starts running for the emergency exit. Just before he got to the door, motherfucking Puff Daddy from Bad Boy Records jumped in front of the door. That n*gga was like, “Eh-eh, eh-eh.” Boy… Puffy got that motherfucker. Then every celebrity ran out ’cause every celebrity saw themselves in me, and they started beating the fuck out of that kid. And I know Chris was backstage looking like, “Nobody helped me.” ♪ Everybody Hates Chris! ♪ Look, it was way more intense than what you guys might have read. I don’t know what you read, but the kid, while we was beating on him, reached in his waistband, pulled out 22-caliber pistol. That shit was mayhem. Everybody started screaming, “Oh, my God, he’s got a gun.” And then I got scared. I was in the back, but I was scared. ‘Cause I knew that everybody that was with me, was armed. Yes, if they had shot and killed this kid',\n",
              "  ' on stage at the Hollywood Bowl… like I pay you to do, Travis… But Travis G-ed up. Travis wrestled the gun out of the kid’s hand. Then he took it like this and tried to chamber the round and he couldn’t. So he pulled the trigger and it wasn’t a gun. A knife blade popped out of the front. I guess this kid was going to stab me. That’s some scary shit. So the next night, even though I didn’t have a show, I said, “I got to get back on stage.” I went and did a show. And someone in the audience screamed out, “Dave, what happened with the attack?” And I didn’t know there was a journalist in the room. All I said was that this n*gga had a knife that identified as a gun. I got six more weeks of bad press for that joke. I didn’t even do nothing to this n*gga. That’s not right. That was not right. And then the New York Post went to the jail and interviewed my attacker like he was some kind of hero. And I read that interview. It turns out the entire attack was my fault. Yes, I triggered him. I didn’t mean to. I had done jokes about the homeless. It turns out… this young man was homeless. And, I mean, there’s no way I could’ve known this. But I will say… for a homeless guy, this n*gga had incredible seats… Oh, and they said I triggered them because I had done LBGTQ jokes. And it turns out this fellow was a B. That was the headline in the article that said, “Dave Chappelle’s alleged attacker is bisexual.” I said, “alleged attacker”? This motherfucker definitely attacked me. I’ll show you the tape. He’s allegedly bisexual. I’ll need to see him suck somebody’s dick before I believe the rest of this article… I read that shit in the paper. I was horrified. I was like, “Bisexual? I could have been raped!” No. You know what, though? It’s not funny because… Because after all that madness ensued, I went to the hotel room. I was by myself, and I opened the door, and my wife was in there alone. She was sobbing. Like sobbing. I said, “My God, what’s wrong with you? Bitch, did you get attacked, too?” And she’s crying. She said, “Oh, my God, Dave.” She said',\n",
              "  \", “If you had died tonight… me and the kids would have nothing.” Then I knew it was serious. So I sat down on the bed next to her. I reached in my pocket, I pulled some keys out that she’d never seen before. She’s like, “Oh!” “What are those keys?” And I gently placed them in her hands. I said, “Sweetheart, those are the keys to my safe deposit box. God forbid anything ever happen to me. But if it does, don’t even worry about it. You and the kids have everything you need in that box. I’ve already taken care of it.” And she was looking at them keys. And I could see her mind realize what we were actually talking about. And then she just started crying harder. And to be honest with you, that made me cry a little bit, too. And we hugged each other real tight. Do you know this bitch looked in the box while I’m alive and well? Who does that? Oh, my God. And then she was mad at me. She said, “Goddamn it, David. I opened that box.” I said, “You did?” She said, “Yes, I did, and there was nothing in there.” I said, “Nothing?” She said, “Nothing except your stupid joke book.” I was like, “Phew.” I said, “Well, sweetie, look. If you tell those jokes exactly how they’re written, you and the kids should be fine. They’re really good jokes.” She’s like, “Good jokes? What is this shit?” “‘Come join me in my watery grave.'” No. You gotta roll your throat. [trilling voice] Come join me in my watery grave. Oh, boy. Oh, boy. I have been married a long time. I have. You know, I talk a lot of shit about my wife, but I love her very much. In fact, you know, you guys wouldn’t believe this about me. I’m a jealous husband. It’s true. Let me tell you something. One time I thought my wife was cheating on me. Yes, n*gga. Yes. That was one of the worst days of my fucking life. I couldn’t take it. And I’m embarrassed about it now, but I can talk about it. You know what I did? It’s fucked up. But I did do this. I waited. I waited for her to fall asleep. And I waited a long time. She’s Asian. I couldn’t tell if she was asleep or not. I was looking at her… And whe\",\n",
              "  'n I was sure she was asleep, you know what I did? I stole the iPhone. Took it downstairs, started trying out passwords to see if I could open it. I couldn’t figure out the password. Then I remembered, it’s an iPhone. This shit has facial recognition. I was just like… And that shit opened right up… And I saw a text message in there from a fellow named Earl. I don’t know anybody named Earl. I woke her up out of her sleep. I said, “Wake the fuck up! Who the fuck is Earl?” She said, “What are you talking about?” “Don’t you play dumb with me, bitch!” “I done open your phone. Who is Earl?” She’s like, “Oh, my God, David.” “That’s gay Earl from the hair salon.” I said, “Word. What am I, a dummy? How am I supposed to know this n*gga is gay?” And she was calm. She said, “Read his texts and look at his pictures.” I started reading them texts. Hmm. “This fellow sure does spell girl with a ‘u’ a lot.” And I switched over and looked at his pictures and I couldn’t believe it. This fellow looked gay in still pictures. His mouth was open in every shot. And then I knew she was telling the truth. And then I felt, like, dumb. I said, “I’m sorry. I’m sorry. Okay? I’m sorry. Here. Take your phone. I’m sorry. Just go back to sleep. I am sorry. I just… I guess I’ve just been insecure ’cause of all this cheating I’ve been doing. Good night.” She didn’t let me leave. Said, “Since you wanna wake a bitch up…” Then she pulled my phone from under her pillow. I said, “What the fuck?” She said, “Who is this bitch in this picture?” I said, “How’d you open that phone?” She said, “Easy. All I had to do was mash my nose and go like this, and it opened right up.” I said, “What the fuck?” She said, “Who is this bitch?” I said, “Give me that. Girl, relax. That ain’t no bitch. This is my friend. Deborah.” I’m gonna close the night with a long story. Do you mind? All right. It’s a long one. So pretend that I’ve finished. ‘Cause I gotta go get a cigarette. All right? I’m not done, but just act like it. I’d prefer standing ovations since we’re acting. Thank you very much',\n",
              "  '. Good night. Thanks for not giving me a standing O, motherfuckers. This is the worst. It’s all right. I just wanted to smoke. You like that, don’t you? Okay. Before I did Killin’ Them Softly, when I was 22, HBO gave me the biggest opportunity of my life at that time. They gave me a half-hour special, but this shit was not like a special, you know what I mean? It was like, generic. It didn’t even have a title. It just says “Dave Chappelle.” And I shot it in San Francisco, at a place called Broadway Studios, which is on the second floor of a building. And beneath Broadway Studios is a nightclub. And the special was only supposed to be 30 minutes. And I got ready. I practiced. I did all the shit I was supposed to do. And the night that I taped, 20 minutes into my 30-minute set, I’ll never forget this music. Music started blasting from the nightclub underneath. You could hear it real loud and it fucked my whole show up, and I was devastated. I was a young man. I really believed in what I was doing. And I thought that my dream had been killed. So when I got off stage, I ran down the steps to the alley behind Broadway Studios, where the control trucks are parked, and I kicked that motherfucking door open. And I started yelling at all the producers. I was nobody in show business. Just a guy that believed in myself. I said, “Man, you fucked everything up.” “That fucking music. What the fuck were you thinking?” And there was a guy who was a big-time producer. I ain’t saying no names. He stood up and he said, “Hey, kid, sit the fuck down.” He said, “We didn’t ruin anything.” He said, “We made a deal with that nightclub to not play music, and they didn’t honor the deal.” And I said, “Who didn’t honor the deal?” And he pointed to a guy. I’ll never forget it. It was an old white man sitting in a Ford Taurus by himself. And he said, “That guy right there.” I didn’t waste no time or ask no questions. I went to that Ford Taurus and I beat on that window, I said, “Open the door, motherfucker. I want to talk to you.” That old man looked at me for',\n",
              "  ' one second and wisely drove the fuck off. And left me in the alley cussing at anybody who would listen. And two minutes later, literally 120 seconds later, it couldn’t have been any more than that, the doors of the kitchen in the alley of that nightclub underneath Broadway Studios swung open. And that old man was standing there, that same old man with reinforcements. He had two big goons with him, and he looked at me… He was calm as a cucumber. He said, “You, come here. I want to talk to you.” I didn’t know anything about streets at this age. But I found out later in my life that these men were Russian mobsters. I don’t know what you guys know about the Russian mob, but these are the n*ggas that killed Denzel in Training Day. All the producers knew what I was up against. They said, “Dave, do not go in there.” And I said, “Fuck y’all.” And I walked right into that kitchen and they closed the doors behind me, and it got the dark as fuck in there, and I knew. I’m not dumb. I knew I was in a bad situation. But you have to understand, I believed in what I was doing, and I didn’t give a fuck. Just kept cussing at these motherfuckers. Tell them how they ruined my life. And that old man couldn’t believe that I was talking all of this shit. And as soon as I took a breath, he stopped me gently. He said, “Hey, kid, listen. Your friends lied to you.” He said. “We made a deal. But your friends never paid me.” And when he said that, I realized I was locked in a kitchen. I realized he was telling the truth, which would make me wrong. And the moment, the very moment that I realized I was wrong, for the first time, I was afraid. You see, it’s a funny thing if you believe you’re absolutely right. You can get drunk off the feeling of how right you are. That’s why gay people are so mean… But I didn’t buckle. You guys would’ve been very proud of me. I was scared, but I didn’t buckle. I said, “Well, then, sir, I owe you an apology. But I believe that no matter what reason that music was playing, it ruined my life.” And that old man looked at me with ',\n",
              "  \"sympathy in his eyes. And he walked over to me and he gently placed his hand on my cheek. Which I gotta tell you, it is a very emasculating thing to do. I was standing there looking at this n*gga’s hand on my cheek, like… And he said, “You are a real man.” And he tapped me on my cheek. Real soft. And just like that, the doors open back up. The light from the alley flooded into the kitchen, and I just walked out alive. I lived to fight… another day. And in that moment, I learned one of the most valuable lessons of my life, and I have to share it with you. And that lesson is this. In your life, at any given moment, the strongest dream in that moment wins that moment. I am a very powerful dreamer. Yeah, I’m not lying. I dreamed tonight, this very night, as a 14-year-old boy, and I am living it as a 50-year-old man. My dreams are very strong. Today, I walked all around Washington. I used to be poor in this city, and all day, people just said, “Hey, Dave. Hey, Dave.” Like they knew me personally, and I felt like I knew them. And I say to myself, “My God, Dave, what a powerful dream.” But then, sometimes… Sometimes… I feel regular. I just feel like myself. Maybe I’ll smoke some weed and be at some nightclub and feel shy. But I’ll look across the nightclub, see some guy that no one’s ever heard of. But this n*gga worked all week and got bottle service, and this bitch is bringing Moët and sparklers to ’em. I picture, in my mind, he’s Persian. He’s doing some kind of weird Persian dance. He got six bitches at his table because he got so much liquor. And they all just saying, “Go Cena! Go Cena!” And I was looking across the room like, “Oh, my God. I’m in that guy’s dream.” I can hear him telling his friends. “Hey, how was the club last night?” “That shit was fantastic. I had bottle service. I seen Dave Chappelle across the club, looking at me like, ‘Who is that?'” And that’s the trick to life. You have to be wise enough to know when you were living in your dream. And you have to be humble enough to accept when you’re in someone else’s. Tha\",\n",
              "  't’s why… That’s why I don’t judge between Will Smith, and Chris Rock. Because you guys look at them as big ideas, but I look at them as fellow dreamers. I can’t judge between them because I see myself in both of them. I am Will Smith. I am the man that cannot take it anymore and will slap the shit out of the next person that says a cross word to me or somebody that I love. And I am Chris Rock. I am the man that can get slapped in front of the whole world and keep my composure so I don’t fuck anything up. T hat… is what… men do. Men make boundaries. Men enforce boundaries. And men tests boundaries. And no man test more boundaries than a trans man… When I see a fellow dreamer, I give them my utmost respect, even if I don’t understand what their dream is. I know a dreamer when I see one. And I’ve met many powerful dreamers in my life. None more powerful than a man who calls himself… Lil Nas X. I met this n*gga at a party. I had no idea who he was. But the minute he walked in that party, I knew I was in his dream. Everybody in the party was another dreamer. Everyone was famous. But when that n*gga walked in, he was dressed like C-3PO. He was shining. And everyone was like, “Oh, my God, there he is. That’s Lil Nas X!” I didn’t know who he was. For some reason, out of all of them dreamers, he walked right up to me. And he said, “I tried to get you in my video.” I didn’t know what the fuck he was talking about. I said, “What?” “What video?” And he was just looking at me like… “You know what video,” and walked away. And I watched him walk away. I said, “Man.” I said… “This n*gga’s having a very powerful dream.” You know what it reminded me of? It remind me of when we was in grade school. Remember, the teacher would ask everybody what they want to be. “Timmy. Timmy, what do you want to be when you grow up?” Timmy acted like he had an idea. He’d stand up and he’d say, “I want to be a fireman.” And the teacher would say, “Timmy, that is a beautiful dream.” But Timmy didn’t mean it. Timmy said he wanted to be a fireman because deep down, Tim',\n",
              "  'my is attracted to fire. And by the time he’s 14 years old, this n*gga is a full-blown pyromaniac, playing with kerosene and matches like a goddamn expert. Then one night he goes downtown with his buddies fucking around with fire, burns a warehouse down. He doesn’t know it, but there’s 13 migrant workers from El Salvador in that motherfucker. They get trapped and then they die in the fire. Isn’t that a tragedy? Well, it was an accident. He’s only 14 years old. But he’s Black. So they try him as an adult. Timmy ends up spending the rest of his life in jail. Dream deferred. [mimics buzzer sound] “What about you, Billy? Billy? Billy, What do you want to be when you grow up?” Billy stands up and he says, “I want to be president of the United States.” And the teacher says, “Oh, my God, Billy. Billy, that is a wonderful dream.” And Billy means that shit. Billy does everything right. That motherfucker gets his grades up, he joins student government. He even does extracurricular activities like show choir just to make his resume look good. He’s on track to be president. But junior year, he wipes. When he’s 16, he gets his girlfriend pregnant, and has to drop out of high school to make ends meet. But lucky for him, the local Walmart’s hiring. By the time he’s 20 years old, this motherfucker makes assistant manager at Walmart. He’s the youngest one in the district. He says, “Oh, my God, if I can keep this up for four more years, I could be a manager. If I can keep this up for six more years after that, I could even be a regional manager and have as many as three Walmarts under my control.” And he’s a big-picture guy. He sees where this path is going. So he kills himself. [mimics buzzer sound] “What about you? What do you want to be when you grow up?” “I don’t wanna say. Because I don’t want the other kids to laugh at me.” “Who cares if they laugh? Your dream is yours. Own your dreams so they can come true. Say it loud and proud. What do you want to be when you grow up, Lil Nas X?” That n*gga stood up in front of the whole class. “I want to',\n",
              "  ' be the gayest n*gga that ever lived. I want to do a music video, slide down a stripper pole, all the way to the depths of hell, and suck the devil’s dick at ten o’clock on BET while all the kids are awake and can see me.” Shockingly, that was the only dream that worked out. That’s why I’m here. Tonight. In the city where I built the dreams that I live. ‘Cause I wanted to tell you all that they came true. And I wanted to thank you all for making the man that I am today. Yes, I am living a very powerful dream. Every time I come to this city and I stand in front of you, I realize that, “My God, man, this is not my dream at all. It’s yours, and I am honored to be in it.” Thank you very much, Washington D.C.

(AUDIENCE CHUCKLING) Well, it’s always been hard for me to connect with people throughout my whole life, and I think there’s, you know, a lot of reasons for that. Um, I have a hearing loss that I’ve had since I was a kid. When I was three years old… I failed a hearing test. I took a hearing test and the doctor said, “You failed the hearing test.” Well, I didn’t know what he said, but… (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING) …he said something, and my parents got upset, so I assumed I didn’t nail it, and… So he told my parents, he said, “This kid needs hearing aids.” And so instead of doing that, they didn’t. So we just… (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING) …coasted until I was 21. I didn’t wear them till I was 21. I wore them for like a week when I was in fifth grade, but then this girl I had a crush on asked about them. She’s like, “What’s in your ear?” I was like, “Well, that’s the end of that forever.” (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING) “So I’ll figure… I’ll figure it out.” It instilled this kinda sense of shame in me. You know, I took it as something was wrong with me. I put it on myself. I go, “I must be fucked up.” And then I’m like, “No, my doctor fucked up.” And then my friends were like, “No, dude, your parents, your parents fucked up.” And it’s like, “Oh, cool, well, add it to their tab.” Like, I don’t know… (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING) They got a long tab running, you know. Also, they got divorced when I was 12, which is, like, the most “fuck you” age you could possibly… (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING) Like, you guys weren’t, like, killing it when I was five. You couldn’t have done it then? You had to wait until I was 12? They did do the thing where they… This is a common thing I think parents do when they get divorced, they tell their kids… They told me, “It’s not your fault. Don’t worry, it’s not your fault.” It’s like, “Yeah, first of all, I wasn’t thinking that. Uh… I don’t know why you thought I thought it was on me. Have you seen you guys? Mom is cripplingly insecure, and Dad’s addicted to prostitutes. On what fucking world is this on me?” (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING) I didn’t have a good blueprint… for what a relationship should look like, so, you know, I’ve struggled accordingly. I’ve had issues in relationships. There’s other reasons for that, too. Like it can’t be a good thing… (CHUCKLES) It can’t be a good thing that the first… 2,000… sexual experiences of my life… (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING) …were with a Dell computer. Like that can’t be… (AUDIENCE LAUGHING',\n",
              "  ') It can’t be helping. It can’t be pushing me in the right direction on this pursuit of love and happiness that I’m on. Two thousand. That’s the number, by the way. I didn’t, like, write down a funny number for you. I counted. (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING) It’s literally 2,000, age 12 to 19 was exclusively that every single day. I bought a computer for my family with my bar mitzvah money, and then I fucked it for seven years straight. (AUDIENCE LAUGHING, APPLAUDING) That’s how I began. That is the origin story to my sexual identity, just downloading sexist shit into my head. Then waltzing out into the world like, “Oh, yeah, I totally respect people.” How? How is that even possible? It’s so corrosive. That shit will rot your brain. And it’s certainly, for a young boy, like, it’s insane. Even now, it’s like… We like to pretend like it’s fine, but that’s only because we don’t have to acknowledge what it is that we’re doing. It’s like this virtual, wordless escapade. You never have to be accountable for what it is you’re doing. I think before… you’re allowed to click on a video… you should have to say the title out loud. (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) How badly do you want this? I feel like most people are like, “I’m just gonna call my mom and reconnect… the person I need to be.” (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING) And it’s bled in. Yeah, my relationship dynamics have always been somewhat turbulent. A lot of back and forth, break up, get back together kind of things. A lot of things that start really quickly. It’s like immediate intensity, you know? Because usually I feel like shit about myself and they feel like shit about themselves, and we come together and we’re like, “Well, we have each other. And we can do all this stuff! We can do all this stuff together now that we’re both here. We can rub each other’s heads. We can take naps together. We can, like, slow dance in the kitchen while we’re waiting for our cookies to finish baking.” How specific do you want me to get? (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING) But then when I have all that stuff, I’m able to see, I’m like, “Oh, this is a very codependent relationship, this isn’t healthy. This isn’t the kind of thing I wanna be in long term. You’re not the person that’s right for me.” So I’ll be like, “Maybe we should break up.” But then they leave, they take all the stuff! I’m like, “I wanna break up with you, but you should love me still. Like, you should still give me all the things, just don’t ask me for anything.” (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING) Like, “I need you. Like, this is all built off of the back of you. Like, your love for me gav',\n",
              "  'e me the confidence to even feel like I could break up with you.” (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) “I never would’ve broken up with you if I was by myself.” (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) But it’s a self-esteem thing. I don’t feel… I don’t feel, like, good enough for the person that I… that would be right for me, you know? So, what if… I play this in my head. What it feels like I need to do is I need to find a girlfriend, uh, in order to be confident enough to be the type of person that I would need to be in order to attract the girl that I actually want to be with. (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING) On my own, I’m nothing, but in a relationship, I’m kind of a catch. (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) (CHUCKLES) I feel like this is a common phenomenon, that love at first sight, that idea, it gets propagated. We all know what you mean by it, “love at first sight.” And it’s something that’s a really enchanting idea, you know? ‘Cause you’re like, you know, one minute you’re alone, the next minute you’ve found the one. It’s like, “What a… What a day.” (CHUCKLES) (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING) What a day that would be. And so it’s so enticing, but I’ve seen… I’ve gone that route so many times, I know what’s on the back end of it, so it’s hard for me not to be cynical about it. Now when I hear people like, “We knew right away…” Did you? ‘Cause now anytime I hear someone say about their own relationship, “We knew right away,” all I hear is, “We were both abandoned as children.” (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) You knew right away? Your threshold for loving a person is you saw them once? That seems like a low bar to clear. (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING) I feel like maybe you can’t handle the anxiety of uncertainty, so you went from zero to 100 right away to skip over that prospect of rejection and the risk that they might not be who you imagine them to be. Am I close? Am I fucking close? -Like, I feel like that… (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) …is a more accurate characterization of what we’re talking about. If you’re drawn to somebody that quickly, that strongly, that intensely, that immediately, that’s not love. You probably have unresolved trauma. (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING) And the other person probably represents an embodiment of the trigger of that trauma, so you’re drawn to them in this misguided attempt to retroactively fix a fucked-up period in your past. That’s not love! Don’t call that love. Don’t rebrand that as love and make the rest of us feel bad. Don’t be out in the world like, “It was love at first sight.” Say something honest like, “It was ‘I felt the way I did when my dad left’ at first sight.” (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) I’',\n",
              "  'll believe that. I’ll believe that, yeah. “My husband’s face looks just like the back of my father’s head, so I chased it…” (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) “…to now.” (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING) You should not be chasing. Don’t chase. Love should not be chased. (GASPS) You shouldn’t have that, like, “Are we gonna make it?” (CHUCKLES) No! (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) If you’re wondering, no. You should not be chasing. Like in movies, like, to propagate this idea, “chase them,” and that rom-com fantasy of chasing someone to an airport. Chase a therapist to an airport. Like, don’t… Like, “Don’t leave, we have so much work to do!” Like, that’s… (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING) (CHUCKLES) No, ’cause movies have to show you… They can’t show you what love actually is. We don’t wanna see it. Love isn’t entertaining. They have to show some dramatic, conflicted version of love. They don’t… We don’t wanna see love, actual love. It’s beautiful. I’m not shitting on the sentiment. It’s an amazing thing between the two people. It’s not fun to watch. Think about a couple you know, maybe you are that couple, who are truly in love, in love, like, together, good, healthy. We don’t wanna watch that. Like, if you wanna… If you… (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING) If you watched a movie about a couple in love, you would just be on your couch watching a couple on their couch, watching a better movie. (AUDIENCE LAUGHING, APPLAUDING) You’re like, “Why… What are they watching? I’ll just watch that. Why don’t we cut out… cut out the middleman? I don’t need…” (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING) AUDIENCE MEMBER: Oh, my God. That’s not what they show you. ‘Cause we don’t wanna see… We don’t wanna see healthy, good love. We wanna see, like, a manifestation of, like, our own internal dramas played out… for entertainment value. The problem is there are people out there, like when I was a kid, who are like empty canvases, who internalized that. And so it starts to skew their view of what love could be. Like, people who don’t have a healthy blueprint are gonna absorb that and take that in. You know, I was 12 years old when the movie Titanic came out, and that was, like, iconic love story. Like, here it is, epic love, cruelly interrupted by fate. And I look at that movie now, I’m like, “Wait, what were we rooting for here? What did we want to happen? For them to get to New York? They weren’t gonna make it as a couple.” What did we think? They’re 20 years old, they’ve known each other two days. I don’t know everything about relationships, but like, hey, maybe don’t marry the artist you fucked on a cruise. (AUDIENCE LAUGHING, APPL',\n",
              "  'AUDING) Maybe that’s not the move. Five minutes after you tried to kill yourself. Do you remember that’s how they met? She was trying to kill herself by jumping off the boat, and he was like, “Hey, I’m pretty hot. What if you didn’t do that?” And so… (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) That’s how they started. They knew right away. Like, that’s the thing, is like, what happens? How is that gonna play out? Even if they get to New York, what? -They have nothing in common. (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING) You know what I mean? Like, all they have is the excitement that they made it. That lasts, what? Six months, a year… two years, maybe? What happens five, ten years down the road? Just sittin’ there. He’s like, “So… you want me to draw you?” She’s like, “Fuck you!” (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) “I was engaged to a billionaire. I had to sell that necklace to pay the heating bill. You haven’t sold a sketch in years, Jack. How’s that art gallery going, Jack?” He’s like, “Oh, come on. Remember when we danced -with the common folk?” (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) Terrible. It would’ve been terrible. People are like, “Oh, it’s so sad what happened. If they didn’t hit the iceberg…” Fuck that! The iceberg is the hero of that movie. (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) It might’ve killed Jack, but it saved the rest of Rose’s life. (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) I like movies, I do. I do. I don’t like movie culture, though, like Hollywood… like the culture surrounding it. And every time I get roped into watching an award show, I’m always reminded, like, who the fuck makes these things. It’s like, “Oh, my God.” You ever watch an award show? It’s like this shouldn’t be on television. This should be, like… like, in an underground cave at Bohemian Grove. Like, why is this in front of the public? ‘Cause they try to act like they’re down-to-earth. Every time an actor wins an award, they always give some… It’s not some, like, normal speech, it’s like a lofty, sociopolitical response to the moment. It’s like, “We need to find a way. There’s a lot of problems in the world. We need to find a way to come together and not let it divide us.” Like Meryl Streep, “We need to come together.” (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING) “Find unity and strength, and break down the barriers that keep us apart. -And find strength and unity.” (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING) “Come together as a globe, as a nation, as a people.” I’m always like, “Yeah, uh, you’re wearing a diamond dress from Givenchy.” Like, on what fucking planet are you part of “the people”? (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING) Like, what do you think? Like, if there was a true people’s revolution, like a people’s up',\n",

They’re gonna rip your fucking head off, stick it on a stake, and sell that diamond dress to a cartel for machine guns. (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) They’re not gonna be like, “Oh, get in the bunker. We love the nuance of your artistic choices. It was so brave of you, how you dared, oh, how you dared to be a middle-class character.” Like, “Oh, how you pretended to be a thing people are their entire lives. How did you do it? How did you prepare for the role?” And they’re always like, “Oh, I lived amongst plumbers -for eight months.” (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) “I lived how they lived. I ate how they ate.” (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING) No, that’s it, you can’t. You can’t preach togetherness and unity when you’re that rich. You just can’t do it. You’re rich. You’re super rich. That’s why you got rich, is to get the fuck away from everybody. (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING) That’s what money is. Money is just an escape from people. That’s why we want it. Everything money does for you. Doesn’t even have to be a lot of money. You’d be like, “Ooh, I can afford an Uber.” What’s an Uber? That is a bus for one person. (AUDIENCE LAUGHING, APPLAUDING) It’s like, “Yeah, I like the bus. I just wish there were no people on it and it only went where I want it to go.” (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) Yeah, you can do that. You gotta pay for it. You wanna join a gym, there’s different kinds of gyms, right? There’s a whole spectrum of gym options. There’s a ten-dollar-a-month gym on one end. Two-hundred-dollar-a-month gym on the other end. What’s the difference? Two-hundred-dollar-a-month gym, it’s nicer. It’s not 20 times nicer. It’s not like the ten-dollar-a-month gym, the walls are falling off, and you pick up the ten-pound weight and it’s 100 pounds. You’re like, “Oh, fuck this gym! The dumbbells are Gatorade bottles filled with rocks, this gym sucks.” (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) No, there’s still equipment there. The 200-dollar-a-month gym, you pay 200 dollars a month so you don’t have to look at people who can only afford ten dollars a month. (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) That’s what you’re paying for. You wanna be able to do a pull-up without being reminded of the dark underbelly of capitalism. (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING) It’s a 190-dollar surcharge to not have to make eye contact with the consolation prize in this fucked-up game we’re all playing here. That’s what you’re paying for. That’s the premium. Everything money does for you just pushes you further and furth',\n",

They’ll be like, “No, you get more space.” It’s like, yeah, motherfucker, space is just the absence of people. (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) It’s not a new entity. Space is a euphemism for not anybody. “No, you get all this legroom.” Yeah, ’cause they’re no people in the way of where my legs are trying to go. We could all have legroom back here if we weren’t all back here. (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) Now, could you imagine if two people in economy class were, like, fighting over the armrest, and some asshole from first class came back and was like, “Hey! We need to all work together. We need to find unity and strength as a flight. We’re all flight 348, after all.” Then they swoosh the curtain and go back to their apartment in the sky. How quickly before the back rows start bundling their plastic silverware together to storm the front? (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) Like, “No, no, we’re not trying to hijack the plane, we’re just trying to kill rows one through five. Take their hot towels and orange juice and spread it around.” (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING) That’s the fantasy. Everyone fantasizes about what they would do when they get rich. You wanna get away from everybody. Nobody fantasizes about togetherness. Nobody’s like, “Oh, dude, if I got rich… (CHUCKLES) I would get so many roommates.” (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) “Oh, it’d be sick, we’d have like a dishes schedule.” (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING) No, the fantasy is, “I’m gonna build a moat around my house. People aren’t gonna be able to ring my doorbell without swimming across a crocodile-laden river.” (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING) Fuck everybody. And I got nothing against rich people. You just can’t have it both ways. You can’t bridge class with a speech. You can’t have it all and then have this, like, faux empathy. Like, “Aww… it’s so sad, people don’t have any money.” It’s like, “Well, you seem to have it.” (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING) “Try giving it away. You don’t have to have it.” And these phony causes, every Thanksgiving, one of them comes out with, like, “It’s so terrible what happened to the Native Americans.” It’s like, “Fucking, I don’t know, give ’em the land back.” (AUDIENCE APPLAUDING, CHEERING) (CHUCKLES SARCASTICALLY) “No.” (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) “We can’t do that.

And I’ll try to find another place to do, “My thoughts.” (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING) “Soon I’ll be full.” (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING) So you have to consider the source, right? I think about that with all media. Social media, for example, like, you know… You look at like Twitter or something like that, it’s like… Like Twitter… Who’s on Twitter? It’s just… It’s only people who think it’s like a good idea -to be on Twitter. Like… (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING) It’s not everybody. It pretends to be everybody, like, “Ooh, everyone’s mad.” You look at the trending topics, “Ooh, what’s everyone talking about?” It’s not. Most people aren’t on it. Eighty percent of the public doesn’t use it. Ninety percent, I think, doesn’t use it regularly. So, like, what’s trending? Like… Most people aren’t there, so what’s really trending is shutting the fuck up. Like, most people… (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING) Most people are doing that, but you can’t register that. You can’t show somebody not tweeting. Like you can’t… They should show how much we don’t tweet also. They should show like a tweet, and then you scroll through blank space for like seven hours.

I want you to cut open your heart and dump it into my brain. Intimacy is what I’m looking for. Which is not… I shouldn’t go to social media for intimacy, you can’t get it. You ever see someone try to be intimate on social media? -It’s fucking terrible. (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING) It doesn’t work. It never works, ’cause it doesn’t have the language for intimacy. ‘Cause intimacy is amorphous. It doesn’t come with a character limit, or a soundtrack, or filter, it’s just… (GRUNTS) The language of social media, is like, snark and division and attacks and clapbacks and, “Oh, that?

It’s like very confusing, and there’s a big market right now for certainty. Anyone who has an answer, even if it’s the wrong one, is in demand. That’s why you get this whole rash of people who garner these followings, ’cause they’re giving people a narrative.

What do I have to do to get there?” But then you look at Venmo and it’s like, “Oh, no, dude, they split that pizza.” (AUDIENCE CHEERING) (APPLAUSE) “I’m doing just fine.” (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) “I don’t need medication.” (CHUCKLES) It’s not a referendum on splitting stuff in a relationship. I think if you’re gonna split stuff, just don’t split the items. Go every other. Does that make sense? I’ll see that on Venmo. I go on Venmo, I’ll see, “Boyfriend sends girlfriend money for tacos.” I’m just, like, how the fuck do you go down on someone after you just sent them eight bucks? (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) (SCOFFS) “You’re just bitter, Drew, that you have no one to split stuff with.” (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) Yeah, I’m single. I’m 36… and single. I’m single and 36, which is fine. Uh, but it is almost not. (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING) Like, it’s not bad yet, but bad is next. (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) Bad is the next stop on this… train. A lot of my friends are married. And it’s cool to see. A lot of them are in, like, really great relationships, really healthy, good, loving relationships. And it’s really amazing to see. I go to their weddings, I really enjoy it. Seeing them come together, it’s a beautiful thing. And I hear a lot of the same things in the vows. There’s a common refrain in the vows, which is something about, like, you know, “I get to marry my best friend.” “I’m so lucky to have found my best friend.” “I never thought I would spend the rest of my life with my best friend.” And I hear that, I’m like, “That’s such a beautiful sentiment.” Like, the person you marry should feel… like your best friend. I’m in the back, I’m like, “Well, I’m 36, so who the fuck meets their best friend in their late thirties?” (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING) Who’s out there like, “This is my best friend! We met when were 38!” (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) “Tell him, Doug!” (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING) No, it doesn’t h',\n",
              "  'appen. They’re all having kids, too, starting families. My friends starting families, it’s beautiful to see. I don’t have my own family. I have, like, a family from which I’ve come. I don’t have… (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING) …the next line on that. Like on a family tree, I’m just a node that ends. (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING) It’s just like, “Who’s that?” “That’s your great Uncle Drew, nobody loved him.” (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) Just a leaf on a twig. Just a Styrofoam ball with no toothpicks, if we’re using school project lingo. (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING) “Oh, cool, you got me a PlayStation for my birthday. I love you, Dad.” I just beat God of War for the fourth time. (AUDIENCE MEMBER CHEERING) It’s a good game. (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING) It’s not “hugging my smiling child” good. (AUDIENCE LAUGH) But the gameplay mechanics are pretty tight. (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING) I think part of the reason I don’t… have a family, well, at least what I used to tell myself, is that I do this. It’s something that I chose. I chose a different path. I remember I started doing stand-up when I was 22. I dropped out of school, and… at the time, my mother warned me. She said, “You know, it’s not very stable. You’re gonna be living hand-to-mouth, traveling a lot. You’re not gonna be able to settle down.” And she was right to an extent. But the problem was, she was telling this to a 22-year-old dude. Like the least likely candidate on Earth to settle down. I don’t know if you know any 22-year-old dudes, but they’re not technically people. (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) Just unprocessed pain and skin. Like, that’s pretty much the identity there. So, 22, I’m hearing this, I’m like, “Settle down? What are you, a hundred? I don’t give a fuck. I’m going on the road, Mom. I’ma follow my dreams! Nobody is gonna stop me!” That was my attitude. Now I’m 36. Now I see the punchline. Now it’s like… (LAUGHS SARCASTICALLY) “Nobody is going to hug me as I die.” (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING) (CHUCKLES SARCASTICALLY) Is that funny? I don’t know. I structured it as a joke. Does that make it funny? I don’t know. Does comedy have the ability to transform the emotional constitution of reality, or is it just adding a layer to an unfortunate event? I don’t know how the physics of comedy work. I used to tell myself that it was a sacrifice I was making. I was leaving that on the side to pursue this. And I used to look… It was very easy to make that argument, ’cause I used to look around and there were a lot of men who accomplished things that I considered to be great, whose personal life was kind of left by the wayside. And so it ',\n",
              "  'seemed to me as a necessary component. I remember in high school I learned about Isaac Newton. And Isaac Newton invented calculus. He also died a virgin. (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING) Which begs the question, can you invent calculus while fucking people? (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) I don’t know. It’s never been done. (AUDIENCE LAUGHING, APPLAUDING) A more modern example, Steve Jobs. Steve Jobs was an incredible innovator… uh, terrible father… right, which we know, it’s documented, but we also just knew. (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING) We knew. Every time we’d go into our pocket, if Steve Jobs were a good dad, we’d pull out a Samsung or a Motorola. (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING) Every time you text someone and it shows up blue, that’s Steve Jobs not going to a piano recital -or a softball game. (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) And I don’t think we have the right to judge him. Like, we are all glad he did it. Like, we encouraged that. As a society, we would all rather one girl grow up with a shitty dad than have to all of us use Windows. Are you out of your fucking mind? You want us all to click a Start button and run clunky .exe files just so one girl can open her gifts next to the guy who paid for them? Fuck that! She can get them from a nanny while the rest of us enjoy our… technological ecosystem seamlessly integrated. (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING) That’s what we encourage. We encourage it. True happiness has no societal value. We want productivity. Give us… Make something or shut up! Like, we don’t care. So there’s this incentive to do it. And it gets even more fucked up. Someone like Michael Jackson, who was this incredible popstar and a horrendous babysitter, you know, where it’s just like… (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) Yeah, it’s an easy one, but it’s fun. It’s fun, though. It’s so easy, but it’s so fun. (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING) No, but even that, like there’s such an instinct to defend these guys. Like my first instinct is to be like… see it from their side, because I think we’re such… we’re conditioned to like them on that level. So even with Michael, I was like… you know, there was a part of me… I watched that documentary about him, I was like, “Oh, that’s fucked up.” But there was a part of me that was like, “Yeah, but if not an eight-year-old boy, who was Michael Jackson supposed to date?” (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING) You know what I mean? What is he looking at, options-wise, that makes any sense at all? Somebody his age? He did that. He was married to Lisa Marie Presley, a grown woman, and that was weirder somehow. (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) That was weirder. They made out on television. It was fucki',\n",
              "  'ng weird. There was like an awards show presentation and at the end, they like did this kiss, it was just awful. Like, “Oh!” The whole world was just like, “Oh, my God.” (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING) “Jesus, will somebody get this guy a kid?” -Like, “This is horrible.” (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) Because Michael Jackson with a kid, it upsets us morally, but it looks right. (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING) Michael can’t date an adult. You wouldn’t set your friend up with him. (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING) Who’s he supposed to… What is he gonna do, go on like a blind date with a 35-year-old software developer? How’s that gonna go? “Hey, nice to meet you, Michael.” He’s like, “You wanna play tag? You’re it.” Like, come on. (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) “Where are your…” “Tag? I thought we’d go to dinner.” “Dinner’s for dumb-dumbs. We can eat candy at my house and stay up as late as we want. Tee-hee!” (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING) Michael can’t date an adult. I don’t even know what kind of adult would be into Michael. Like you wanna… you wanna fuck him? Listen to him sure, but, like, you wanna… (IMITATES MICHAEL JACKSON) You wanna fuck that guy? (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING) You wanna fuck him? “Here, doo-doo head.” You’re gonna fuck him? Dude, if you’re an adult and you wanna fuck Michael Jackson… you’re a pedophile. (AUDIENCE LAUGHING, APPLAUDING) But you look at all these guys, you know, Michael Jackson, Isaac Newton, Steve Jobs, they were adored by the world but hated by the people closest to them. And I would imagine that you’d tell yourself that that’s a sacrifice… that you make, but… as I get older, I look at it differently. I don’t know if I look at it as a sacrifice anymore. Maybe… maybe not. Maybe… they just ran from responsibility into the arms of ambition. You know, maybe Apple and Pixar… are just built off the back of one man’s inability to be intimate with the people closest to him. Or with himself. And so it recasts my own path, where I’m like, maybe this isn’t a sacrifice. I’m not comparing myself to… Steve Jobs and… Isaac Newton, you know. It’s a matter of scale. (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING) But even in the comedy world, even the people that I looked up to… When I started, all the people that I looked up to, they’re all either, like, prematurely dead, utterly miserable, or, like, sex criminals. So… where is this headed? (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING) Where is this path going? Their greatness is predicated on their accomplishments, but we fail to recognize how they failed in their private moments. And I think that’s a masculine definition of greatness. Because, like, I don’t look at that as grea',\n",
              "  't anymore because they couldn’t confront who they were as a person. They couldn’t confront the emotional reality of their experience. That is greatness to me. To do that, that is a much greater thing. How great can something be if it’s built on avoidance? I think you have to… confront. And it’s scary. It’s a scary fucking thing to do. Like, I get it. It’s like totally scary for a lot of reasons. One, you can find out that the story you’ve been telling yourself about yourself isn’t true. You can find out that what you thought was like the harsh, brutal reality of yourself, you’re just resting on an easier narrative that could be subverted by something else. Like I used to tell myself stories about myself that have shifted over time. I used to tell myself this was a sacrifice. I used to tell myself that what I was doing up here was important, that it was fearless. That I was fearless for doing this. I had the balls to say shit that nobody else did. Things like that Michael Jackson joke, I’d be like, “That’s fearless. That’s a fearless fucking thing. You can get mad at me. That’s fearless. I’m willing to stand that down.” But as I get older, I’m like, “That’s not… I think it’s funny, but it’s not fearless.” Because my emotional experience is nowhere in there. I’m nowhere in that joke. I wasn’t molested, and I’m not a pedophile. (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING) That would be fearless. (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) The most fearless pedophile joke you could tell is to be one and admit it publicly. (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING) No, worst-case scenario, worst-case scenario, the joke bombs and you don’t like it. You look at me, arms folded, shaking your head and say, “No.” Fortunately, that didn’t happen this evening, but it has happened. It could happen. You can get mad. You could think I suck. You could not like me. But, counterpoint… who are you? (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) I can barely see any of you, and I love none of you. So what is this power… that you hold over me? You’re not me. We are always our most terrifying audience. I believe that. That’s why it’s so funny when people say that, like, public speaking is the number one fear of people. They say, you hear that, “Public speaking is the number one fear of people.” It’s like, “Well, I’m sorry, was confronting yourself on an emotional level not on that questionnaire?” The fuck you talking about, public speaking? I’m public speaking right now. It’s fine. I’m public speaking as a way to avoid confronting myself on an emotional level. (AUDIENCE LAUGHING, APPLAUDING) This is all. Like, up here it’s, like, “Dopamine!”',\n",
              "  ' And if I were at home, it’d be like… (SCREECHES) (SCREECHES) I have used this to avoid so many… I can’t tell you how many relationships I’ve been in where I’ve been like, “Oh, sorry, I can’t hang out with you tonight. I have to go do a show.” Or more specifically, “Sorry, I can’t be there on your birthday. I need to go do this bit about how all my relationships fall apart.” (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING) It’s like just, “Do I need any of this?” And I think as men, we have this tendency to wanna process everything in our lives through, you know, intellect, or logic, or our thoughts, or our reason, things that we do, things that are tactile, and it’s like… you’re ignoring the entire emotional subset of your experience. And this idea that logic and emotions are separate, they’re not. Like your thoughts are not separate from how you feel. Your thoughts… Thoughts are just emotions in drag. (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING) It’s the same ecosystem. It’s hard to dive in… like that. Therapy’s a good way to do it. I think people… a lot of people need… They’re men… all men. (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING) Yeah, I’m comfortable saying that. All men need to go to therapy for… 20 years. Like… (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING, APPLAUDING) Roughly. (CHUCKLES) Sometimes guys get mad. They’re like, “Fuck you, I don’t need shit, you pandering pussy.” It’s like, “Hey. You do.” (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) “What was that?” (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING) Women need therapy too. But usually when a woman goes to therapy, it’s because a man in her life didn’t. (AUDIENCE LAUGHING, APPLAUDING) I started going four times a week. It’s a program, it’s called psychoanalysis, and it’s, uh… The reason you go so often is so that you don’t have time to close up. Like, if you go once a week, you have all week to just close back up, so you stay open throughout the week so you can access parts of yourself that are much harder to access normally. And so it’s very emotional. It’s very exhausting. It’s very trying. I cry a lot. I sob… The other day, I sobbed for, like, 20 minutes straight. And this is how fucked up I am. As soon as I collected myself, my first thought was, “That shouldn’t count toward my time.” (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING) But that’s me trying to get out of that moment. Like that moment was hard to swallow, and so… joke, out, now we’re out of it. But I don’t think that’s how progress gets made. I think if you wanna make progress, you can’t take that left turn at a punchline. You have to go… You have to sit there and process it there. You have to go down. You have to take that Miss Frizzle Magic School Bus all the way. ',\n",
              "  '“We’re going to your emotional core!” (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING) “Look out your left window. Is that Mom going on a date instead of hanging out with you? Yes, it is.” (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING) “Process it! Feel it!” You have to stay there, and leave it there. You can’t buy yourself out of the moment. Otherwise, the progress won’t get made. It’s very hard to do. And I’m up here and I, like, I want to bring you in. Like, that’s where this is going. Like I want… That’s the next step, is I want to bring you all to that place. But it’s hard because, like, I don’t know if there’s a show down there. But I wanna bring you in, but I feel conflicted. I feel like I can’t… I have to like… I feel like that’s how this works, is I go in, I mine my own life for sadness, and then I contort it into a balloon animal for you so you don’t feel ripped off. (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING) I tried… to do that. I wrote… I wrote a joke… that tries to do that. Why did the chicken… (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING) …cross the road? AUDIENCE: Why? Because… he grew up… with an untreated hearing loss… which deprived him of a major sensory connection to the people around him, and it isolated him to the point of chronic torture. And his parents were too caught up in their own drama and insecurities to attend to it, so he processed it as though there was something inherently wrong with him. And his feelings are a threat to his relationships, so he just suffered in silence, feeling like he was 100 feet underwater, wondering why nobody was coming to save him. And then, he finally started wearing hearing aids, which created this insane sensation of being able to participate in a world that he didn’t understand. But because his self-worth was predicated on how special he felt, he realized that the trodden path didn’t appeal to him. So he would get high and watch stand-up comedy as a way to numb the agony of how lost he felt. And in doing so, he found a lot of connection with their points of view, and he thought, “Wow, if I could do that, people could connect to me like that.” So he decided to drop out of school and pursue stand-up comedy, and doing comedy made him feel better for a moment, but it never forced him to address any of the reasons he actually felt like shit. He so badly wanted to feel special and powerful to make up for how worthless he felt, so he would say all sorts of fucked-up things, onstage and off, as a way to separate himself. And a lot of it he stands by, but there are a lot of things he said that were flagrant and unnecessary and hurtful and racist and sexist and homophobic,',\n",
              "  ' all of which he justified under the guise of pushing the envelope, which he thought was an act of justified rebellion against some arbitrary authority. But too late, he learned that a lot of those boundaries are derived from real people’s feelings and experiences and he was essentially exploiting their actual pain and using it as a traffic cone to satisfy this story he was telling himself where he was a genius. And just because people laugh at something doesn’t inherently make it good. They could be just as emotionally immature or ignorant as the perspective in the joke, or they could be responding to joke structure and timing more than content. And then, one day… (MELANCHOLY MUSIC PLAYING) …all the world’s stages boarded up, so he sat alone in a room for a year, and he did nothing but talk to the walls and a therapist. And with no emotion to escape into, he slowly started breaking down the paradigm he’d constructed and moved into the feelings he was running from. And he discovered how badly he had been hurting his entire life, and what it actually is to hurt so badly. And he realized that there was not a single period of his life in which he was truly happy. And through that, he started to realize how much pain he had caused other people. He instantly regretted all the ways in which he’s needlessly made people feel like shit in order to protect his own conception of himself as strong. Then he wanted to disappear from the world entirely because he felt like such an incredibly bad person for having done these things. So his instinct was to beat himself up about it and tell himself what a horrible person he is, but he’s been shaming himself his entire life, and all these things he did were just ways to push people away and deprive himself of any meaningful connection, because of how badly he felt about himself, because it was too scary and painful to be open enough to connect to anyone else. So, while he hurt people, he was hurting no one more than himself, and he doesn’t want to do that anymore. He has worked so hard to clear out space within himself and feel safer in his own body and treat himself like a friend he loves as opposed to an enemy he hates, which means he no longer tolerates dynamics based on his own self-destruction, which has changed numerous relationships in his life, including the one with the art form that he loves. The fear has always been that if he makes peace with the subterranean feelings that drive all of this, he’d lose this piece of himself which has helped him survive and get to this point, a fear ',\n",
              "  'that he won’t be funny anymore, he won’t be special, he’ll just be, which has been an intolerable notion because he doesn’t feel like enough on his own. He’s only known how to exist by chasing, or thinking, or running, or fighting, or straining, or suffering, or striving, or analyzing, anxious energy which ultimately manifests the very same emptiness it’s borne out of. And it keeps him locked into one side of himself, but he’s making every effort to find a way to not give in to those anxieties and sit with the quiet inside of himself because he wants so badly to get to the other side.

              " ['Gary Gulman’s “Born on 3rd Base” transcends traditional observational comedy, offering an hour-long commentary on poverty and inequality with humor and unwavering candor. Set against the grandeur of Toronto’s Great Hall, Gulman transforms mundane experiences into poignant critiques of societal treatment of the poor, interweaving personal narratives with broader societal issues. His material, ranging from the trivialities of Pop-Tarts to the disparities in comedian earnings, is delivered with a confidence that challenges the audience to confront uncomfortable truths. Gulman’s approach is not only technically impressive but also deeply invested in pushing the boundaries of comedy to shed light on economic disparities, making the special a compelling blend of laughter and reflection. * * * Anyhow, a lot of comedians are starting that way, and I think it’s, I think it’s kinda jazzy. Alright. Gary, start the special. It’s… Alright, so I’m doing the special material, but also, I wanna give you a quick excerpt from my one-person show, which is… it’s a work in progress, but I, I have the title. It’s called “Mommy, Look.” And the title stems from my-my theory that… just about every one-person show could be called… “Mommy, Look.” I… I’ve said for a long time, you show me a 4-year-old on a diving board, screaming, “Mommy, look” to an unreceptive audience, in 14 years, I will show you a theater major. “Mommy, look! Mommy! Mommy!” “Mommy, look.” The subtext of my near 30-year comedy career is, “Mommy, look.” The same thing I’ve been screaming since I was 4 years old, just now, I’m doing it from the diaphragm. And with better posture, thanks to my theatrical training. Had my mother looked up once from her “People” magazine… …while I screamed, “Mommy!” I wouldn’t be here right now. I wouldn’t need this type of external validation. I– Some other maladjusted man-child would be here in my stead. I just wanna let the people in the front rows know that they are safe from me, asking what ',\n",
              "  'they do for work. I remember going to comedy shows when I was in high school, and later, and the comedian would ask somebody what they did for work, and then proceed to ridicule their profession. And I just remember thinking, if I am ever in the front row at a comedy show and a comedian asks me what I do for work, I will stand up and say, “What do you do for work?” I didn’t come here to be forcibly cast in your TikTok video. You lazy hack. But here’s the autobiography. I grew up in an oft-ignored sector of Jewish people called… poor. Which is kind of an O. Henry twist there. We were– We were poor Jews, but you laughed because it upset the status quo, but… A culture as big, about 12 million of us, as big as Jewish people, we have versions of you… within it. There are poor Jews, there are rich Jews, there are smart Jews, there are dumb Jews. There are athletic Jews. Yes, there are poor Jews. And we were proper poor. Food stamps, free lunch. Welfare. We were on it. We were on welfare. I got free lunch. The dirty little secret about the free lunch program is that it’s also free breakfast. If you could get to school by 6:15 a.m. for a school day that started at 8:50… The indignities they thrust upon poor kids never end, even in the timing of that, that you would be forced to get up at 5:45 to get some calories, it was almost– It had to have been planned. Let’s prepare these kids for their futures as migrant apple pickers… …and longshoremen… …by getting them up at 5:45 for breakfast. And if you got there by 6:15, you could get a half pint of milk, a Pop-Tart, and a variety pack-sized Kellogg’s cereal box. I-I’m sorry, I said “and.” Or a variety pack-sized… …cereal. And if you got there any later than 6:20, all the good variety pack cereals would be taken. So you would wind up with the Corn Flakes… …which I do not know why they included that in the variety pack. No kid wants Corn Flakes. I would sometimes play it off if I got there late. I would say, “Oh, no, no. I didn’t– “',\n",
              "  'I didn’t want Frosted Flakes. “I wanted, I wanted the Corn Flakes.” “I, I use it in my chicken recipe.” “My, my chicken recipe calls for “a variety pack-size of… …Corn Flakes.” Now, if I got there on time, I would always get the, get the Pop-Tart. But even in the Pop-Tart, the Pop-Tart… was just a complete F-you to the poor kids who were eating it. First of all, it was one Pop-Tart. I knew they came in packs of two. I’m poor. I am not stupid. And then, the other thing about the Pop-Tart, they had enough frosting to spread it all the way to the edge. I’m sure there was a person in the factory who said, “Hey, boss, we have, we have a lot of extra frosting today. “Do you wanna spread it all the way to the edge for this next batch?” And he said, “Do you want these kids to ever stop sucking at the government teat?” “That bitter crust will remind them of what their futures are going to look like.” “Frosting all the way to the edge? “Are you insane? Why don’t we put frosting on both sides while we’re at it?” “What are we, Toaster Strudel? Get back to work, Eugene V. Debs.” Everything about the Pop-Tart they did to screw with poor kids. First of all, the name. It’s not a real tart. And it brought about a cultural blind spot in all poor kids, where the first time we saw a real tart… …there was this cognitive dissonance, this disconnect. “Wait a minute. This…” The first time I ever saw it was at an Au Bon Pain. Au Bon Pain! It was a tart. It said tart, but it looked nothing like a Pop-Tart. The, the real tart has nothing in common with the Pop-Tart. Th-The real tart, first of all, it’s three-dimensional. The Pop-Tart is barely dimensional. You, you would have to be living in Flatland to consider that a dimension. Also, the real tart has chunks of fruit. Apples, pears, raspberries, blueberries in it. Whereas the Pop-Tart has a suggestion of a rumor of a whisper of fruit-flavored, artificially colored schmutz. It’s so fraudulent that the Pop-Tart calls itself… a-a tart. I’m gonna',\n",
              "  ' use an analogy… to clarify this. The– The tart is to the Pop-Tart, as the Grizzly bear is to the… gummy bear. Just… That’s a really strong analogy. And the irony of me coming up with such an apt analogy… is that… I flunked out of analogy school. And flunking out of analogy school is like… It’s as if… I used to think they called it a Pop-Tart because it popped out of the toaster. No. Pop is short for populist. It’s the poor man’s tart. Welfare saved my family, and I’m not ashamed to have been on it. It just has been demonized for decades, and unnecessarily so. It’s infuriating to me because they’ve been making the same argument. Even since I was a kid, they keep making this same argument, and it, and it goes usually like this. “Well, welfare doesn’t work. “That’s why we wanna, we wanna get rid of it. “We wanna strangle the welfare programs “because it just… Doggone it.” “Dagnabbit.” “It doesn’t work. Oh gosh, how I wish it worked!” “But what happens is the-the welfare recipients, “they lose their initiative, “and they become dependent on welfare for generation after generation.” And I remember even at 7 years old, I could see through that flimsy argument. Th-The one thing I will say about poor kids for us is that we’re much more astute about financial ideas and mechanisms than the average person. The-The rich kids have no idea how much we know about what things really cost. Like, at 7 years old, and I’m not exaggerating, I understood the tax ramifications of the alimony portion of my parent’s divorce decree, okay? Because every April, my mother would be crying on the phone with the IRS because it was taxable. The alimony part was taxable, and she owed. And they would, they would say, “We’re gonna put a lien on your house.” And I didn’t know how to spell that type of lien. No. I knew it wasn’t “lean” on our house. There were tears involved. So, I just, I understood these things at a level that most kids don’t understand because these were like traumatic moments in my l',\n",
              "  'ife. So that when I heard this argument, “Welfare doesn’t work. “The people lose their initiative. They become dependent for generation after generation,” I couldn’t have put this into words because I didn’t possess the words “breathtakingly” and “disingenuous.” But… I knew they were full of shit. And-And I would’ve said, “Oh, you’re looking out for my, oh, my initiative. Thank you.” “Thank you for looking out for my character. “I, I have to admit, I was being a little bit cynical. I, I thought you just didn’t wanna pay any taxes.” “But you were looking out for my character. “Thank you so much. “Can I just share a little concern I have? “You already have more money than you can spend. You’re just gonna leave it in a trust fund to your children.” A trust fund is this very expensive way to tell your children you don’t believe in them. “You’re gonna leave this money to your children “in a trust fund. And I just… “I worry your children are gonna lose their initiative “and become dependent for generation after generation, which…” “…is the more likely scenario, considering it’s a cliché.” It’s a cliché we’ve been playing for laughs for hundreds of years, so… Do you know how long the average family stays on welfare? Two years. Two years. Two years is not a generation. Unless you’re a bandicoot. That’s not generation after generation. My family, we were off welfare, all of us, by the time we got out of high school. A pittance of an investment in the Gulman boys. We’ve repaid over and over again in our own taxes. I’m doing fine. This is all Banana Republic. Now, full disclosure, I purchased this “ensemble”… …during one of Banana Republic’s thrice-weekly 40% off sales. If you put in any effort at all, if you show any initiative… …you can wear Banana Republic – for the price of Old Navy. – I am not exaggerating. Just wait until the next 40% off sale. Now. They should have to put a sign up when they’re not offering 40% off, and that sign should say, “closed.” “We’ll email you whe',\n",
              "  'n the next price break comes up.” Then go online, find yourself an additional 20% off promo code. I’ll give you what I used last week. “Summer savings.” Enjoy. Enjoy. Stock up on tees. Whenever I get the promo code, I always think to myself, “I coulda guessed that.” But, the truth is I couldn’t have. It’s always just clever enough. Okay, summer savings? Hm? They spelled summer with a dollar sign. Oh, Banana! You impish scamp! $30 for the shorts. How much for the whimsy? Free whimsy at Banana Republic. Half-off caprice. Capris? The short– No, no, no. Caprice. A synonym for whimsy. Okay, that’s just a little– I always– I pander to my base. Which… Which is librarians. Librarians right now, when they– I had them at O. Henry. And then… We never felt too poor, I will say, and there were, there were three reasons. The reasons were threefold. Imagine. Imagine if I used that suffix “-fold.” It is, without a doubt, the most pretentious suffix… …in the English language. Just say there were three. Threefold? The same type of people who say “threefold” also say, “For lack of a better term.” Whereas working class people like us, instead of saying, for lack of a better term, we go, “Uh…” For lack of a better term. Just think of a better term! The second– The second most pretentious suffix, I would say, is “-esque.” Unless you’re talking about something French, I think you– We’re “-ish” people. I feel comfortable around people who say “-ish.” I think one of the most pretentious things you can say is “Kafkaesque.” That’s just… you’re showing off. We’re working class. Just say “Kafkish.” Which has the benefit of also sounding like a kosher pastry. Can I get a pound of the Kafkish? And a dozen rugelachhh. And a raisin chhhallah. I don’t know if, if Jews are doing this everywhere, but in an attempt to assimilate, I’ve noticed a lot of Jewish people pulling back on the “chhh.” They’re saying challah and rugelah. And I say no. Embrace the “chhh.” Embrace it! What are they gonna do? Hate us',\n",
              "  \"? Alright, so the reasons are threefold. There are three reasons… …why we didn’t feel poor. One. For a poor family, we had pretty good electronics. We frequently had a good television set. Sometimes, we even had a good stereo. And this was all thanks to my Uncle Norman’s job. My mother’s twin brother, Uncle Norman. His job, he was… a burglar. What did I tell you about Jewish people? We have a version of every profession. Uncle Norman was a burglar. And you’re like, “Yeah, but he got out of it and moved on.” No, no, no, he died a burglar. He was, actually, a fence. He would receive stolen merchandise and then resell it. The man never made an honest dollar in his life, but… he got us incredible electronics. Poor people, you have to understand, we’re not very picky about warranties and… …serial numbers and receipts. We just wanna watch color TV. So, Uncle Norman would get us these things, and sometimes, he would store things in our house until the heat was off. Wh-Which took on this other meaning for the heat was off, ’cause sometimes, the heat was off in our house. But we’d have a pinball machine in our kitchen. We were warming our hands on The Who’s “Tommy.” So, that was the first reason we didn’t feel poor. The second reason we didn’t feel poor was that the income inequality was not as vast, as significant, in the ’70s. And up until 1983-ish… …it wasn’t as bad as it, as it is now. What we’re living in now, I would categorize it as “Tale of Two Cities-esque.” In fact, it’s-it’s worse than 18th-century France, In 18th-century France, according to “Tale of Two Cities,” and I’ll just do a little bit of the preamble. The overlapping is-is astonishing. “It was the best of times. It was the worst of times.” Check. “It was the age of wisdom. It was the age of foolishness.” Big check. “It was the epoch of belief. It was the epoch of incredulity.” But I could keep going. But, at no point did Dickens say, “Also, three or four times a week, there was a show called ‘Shark Tank.'” \",\n",
              "  'Even the 18th-century French aristocrats never made their “entrepreneurs” dance for a small investment in their life’s work. That is a cruelty… …that is just us. I– That show… I hate it! Please, if you have an idea, do not go on “Shark Tank.” There are… places that offer much better terms… …than the “Shark Tank” sharks. I happen to have an accounting and finance degree from Boston College. “It’s no Harvard”… was our motto. It sounds much nicer in Latin. Okay, so here’s a place where you can get better terms than the “Shark Tank” sharks, and this is where you should take it. A bank! They make reasonable investments in small businesses. You know who else offers better terms than the “Shark Tank” sharks? The Devil! He’ll take your soul. He will not take as much of your annual net income as the “Shark Tank” sharks. Also, Mr. Gazzo from “Rocky 1,” the loan shark, he offers better terms than the “Shark Tank” sharks. Do not go on “Shark Tank.” I wanna start a show to counter-program against “Shark Tank,” and I would call it… “Guillotine.” And what would happen on “Guillotine” is billionaires would sit in front of working class folks like ourselves, and they would have to convince us not to chop their heads off on live television. And we– “How much of it are you gonna give away? “Some of it? No, no. That’s not enough. – That’s not enough. – Bring the blade up.” “You’re gonna give all of it away? Okay. Alright. No blade.” The income inequality is just… it’s cartoonish. Even in my business, just the difference between me and– Do you remember the guy who played Jerry on “Seinfeld”? Okay. He’s in the same business, ostensibly, as I am, but he is worth over $1 billion. And now let’s say he’s a, he’s a better comedian, for argument’s sake, but then we’ll come back to this universe. Can you imagine? Is he $999,911,000 better than me? And now, you know my net worth. About $89,000, if you consider my security deposit to be an asset. The accounting is murky on that. I’m probably not go',\n",
              "  'nna get the entire… …security, ’cause I had, had dogs, and so… Here’s the thing. Jerry Seinfeld, okay? He owns a building in Manhattan where he houses his extensive Porsche collection. Okay? My wife and I, we don’t have enough room on our kitchen counter to keep the toaster on display at all times. And here’s what’s beautiful about this audience. You’re so generous. You are all picturing a four-slicer. It’s a deuce. My wife and I had to have an apartment-wide meeting… …in which we determined that we-we needed to keep the microwave oven on the counter because you can’t take it out every time you want popcorn. And we had to keep the coffee machine on the counter at all times because I want no delay in getting to the machine that makes the beverage that makes life tolerable. So, she said we should put the blender and the toaster in a cabinet. I’m sorry. The cabinet. And so why am I bitter? Because I can’t imagine that the Seinfelds have to rank their appliances. That’s why I’m jealous. The third reason. The third-fold… …why we never felt poor was my dad. Phil Gulman was what we call a mensch. He was a kind, thoughtful, generous man. A complete failure in terms of capitalism. He never made a great living, but he left us with such strong values. No valuables. I got– I’m not exaggerating. I got his copy of “Gone Girl.” But the values. I remember– This is why we didn’t feel poor. Because he had this policy. He would say, “If there’s something you really want, “just ask me. Don’t steal. Don’t go to Uncle Norman.” “Come to me. I’ll try to find the money.” And then sometimes, he would come through with the money. I remember for my 11th birthday, he got me all the books for “Dungeons and Dragons” and the expert playing set, which came with, like, nine different types of dice. But, unfortunately, and nobody could have foreseen this, it didn’t come with any friends. So he got me that. But then one year, I think it was, like, 1978, let’s say. I wanted to play– I wanted to keep play',\n",
              "  'ing hockey. But hockey, the price for a season of playing hockey was $50 in ’77. And then in 1978, they raised it to $500 because of a new tax policy in Massachusetts, where I grew up. It was called “Prop two-and-a-half.” And people would save 2.5% on their property taxes, and all they had to give up was children’s art, music, gym, afterschool sports, and tutoring. It sounded like a tax policy designed by a Roald Dahl villain. But I wanted to keep playing hockey, so I said to my dad, “I really wanna play hockey.” He said, “If you really wanna play hockey, “I’ll try to find the money “for you to play this sport you’ve shown no potential in.” “Not only have you shown no potential in hockey, but Jews…” “…have acquitted themselves with very little distinction, “to be honest with you, Gary. “Son, go grab the Sports Almanac. “We’re gonna look at the Hockey Hall of Fame. We will count the Jewish players in the Hockey Hall of Fame.” And we open up the book. He said, “Okay, ready? Done.” This was 1978. There were zero Jewish players in the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1978. Now, there are zero Jewish players in the Hockey Hall of Fame. My dad said, “Just for a point of comparison, son, “more Jews have been… the Messiah.” “Do you– “Do you understand that, Gary? That you… “are more likely to walk on water “than you are to skate on it, holding the Stanley Cup?” “But if you really wanna play, we’ll find the money. Yeah, we’ll find the money, Jesus.” One benefit, and I’m sure there are a number of benefits, to growing up poor, for one, it-it humbles you, but also, it makes you more compassionate, more empathetic. I think empathy is, is one of the most valuable things we can teach our kids and-and grow up with. It’s just– It’s almost automatic for poor people because we’ve struggled, and we feel bad seeing other people struggle or-or suffer. Now, that’s not 100% of poor people. Some people get money, and all of a sudden, they wanna pull up the ladder behind them and lock the door. But, fo',\n",
              "  'r most of us, we really go out of our way to try and help people and also be more thoughtful and-and kind to people. You’ll notice that people who have worked fast food jobs are much more polite to the fast food people. People who have waited tables and bartended are the best tippers you will ever be around because we know how much those tips mean to people. And, and we go into fast food restaurants, and we’re much more patient with the people. I think one of the best examples of the rudeness that people treat fast food workers and workers of-of that category is at any of these restaurants where you direct the assembly of your meal. Your Chipotles, your Subways, your Just Salads, your Chop-t. Like, going to Chipotle, you may not have noticed this before tonight, but I assure you you will never not notice it after tonight. The people in front of you at Chipotle, as they direct the assembly of their burrito– Uh, sorry. Or their bowl. I try to be inclusive because– Because people, they feel hurt, and then you get the message the next day. “I was at Gary Gulman’s early show “in Toronto, where he ignored those of us who opt for the bowl.” “Who eschew…” “…the tortilla… “in favor of the bowl for dietary, religious, or political reasons.” Alright. As you’re directing the assembly of the burrito, or the bowl, the people in front of you, notice this. They’ll… Corn. Corn. Corn. Corn. Black beans. Brown rice. You’re like, “What, they point?” Nah, pointing is, is bad, but forgivable. They wag their fingers… …at other humans. That is staggeringly condescending. Also completely unnecessary. They know where the corn is. You found it. You don’t even work here. How would they not know where the corn is by this point in their shift? Just people who’ve worked in this job, we would never, because we’ve had fingers wagged at us. We would always give the Chipotle worker the benefit of the doubt. We would say “corn.” And then, if they looked baffled… …we would subtly… …before we ever got to ',\n",
              "  'that point! I wouldn’t last a shift at Chipotle. I’m so sensitive. Like, earlier tonight, I didn’t say anything ’cause we’re taping a special, but earlier tonight, when I said “Jewish poor,” I felt like most of you laughed in the right way. But, some of you, I felt, um… I mean, I might be being overly sensitive, but did you feel a little bit of a Holocaust denial? Like-Like, there was a laugh, it was like, “ha ha ha ha.” And you, you just heard, “ha ha ha ha.” I heard, “The numbers were exaggerated!” But I’m overly sensitive. So, what I’m saying is… I would not last six seconds at Chipotle. Somebody would come in. “Corn.” And I would… Brenda, I found the corn! It was with the other toppings! Isn’t, isn’t it always the last place you look? She’s– – I sent her into the walk-in. – She must be freezing, and it was here all along. Thank you so much. Where is the brown rice? But make sure to jam your finger into the sneeze guard so I have something to Windex at the end of my shift. Just something to look forward to… …before I go home. How can you be that mean to people? Just that… dismissive of people who probably aren’t being paid a living wage. Might have health insurance. Definitely don’t have dental. I-I love my dentist, but I have… I have a history with dentists in that, I don’t know if you know this about poor people, but most people go to a dentist for their teeth. But poor people, my mother specifically, would go to a local university that had a dental school, and these hungover 23-year-olds would take their midterms in my mother’s mouth, basically, just– And fail again and again and again. Just these mediocre students, just mucking around in my mother’s incisors and bicuspids. And it just built in me kind of this-this antipathy towards dentistry because– I love my dentist, but dentistry, it’s organized crime. First of all, the hygienist does 99.985% of the work. It shouldn’t be called, “going to the dentist.” It should be called, “going to the hygienist featuring t',\n",
              "  'he dentist.” Like, the dentist shows up, has this Stan Lee-ish cameo. One line, which is always, “Oh, we don’t take any insurance.” Did you think you had insurance? You don’t have insurance. You have a free cleaning, which is like the loss leader of dentistry. It’s like the cheap grapes at the front of the grocery store. You’re– “We brought you in here “to find $8,000 worth of work we can do in your mouth. So, no, you don’t have, you don’t have insurance.” You know how you know you don’t have dental insurance? You need dental insurance. That’s how you know you don’t have it. Every other doctor takes insurance. Dr. Dre takes my insurance. Doctors Who, Seuss, Dolittle, Strange, and Doom all take my insurance. They take my insurance in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. “Doctor, doctor, give me the news.” “I’ve got a bad case of loving you.” He… …takes my insurance. It’s unfathomable. A heart surgeon will open up your chest, replace a valve, put in four stents, save and extend your life, $45 co-pay. A… dentist mostly fills miniature potholes. Cash only today. We’ll work out a payment plan like any other strip mall retailer, but you’re gonna pay. And what’s so surprising is that dentists have all come together to deny my insurance. And yet, they are a profession notorious for not being able to reach a consensus on even the simplest of propositions. In a study… …a very serious, important, groundbreaking study, only four out of five dentists… …felt comfortable recommending Trident… …to their patients who chew gum! Now, you-you have to be around my age or older to understand why I stress “chew” gum. There was this commercial in which the narrator would say, “Four out of five dentists recommend Trident to their patients who ‘chew’ gum.” And I remember as a kid, I would say to my mother, “Why are they saying it like that?” “Why are they saying ‘chew’ gum? It should be chew gum.” And my mother by this point had developed Stockholm syndrome. And so, she would side with the dentists.',\n",
              "  ' And a lot of poor people, we have this pathology where we convey wisdom on rich people that they just don’t have. So, I would say to my mother, I said, “Why would they say their patients who ‘chew’ gum?” And my mother, always defending the rich, “I think they know what they’re doing, Gar.” Not in this case! By saying they’re patients who “chew” gum, they’re making it sound like there are alternatives… …to how we ingest gum. Oh, you recommend Trident to your patients who “chew” gum? What do you recommend to your patients who… snort gum? What do you recommend to your IV gum users? What do you recommend they…? Fruit Stripe gum? Okay, yeah. ‘Cause it starts off very strong, and then it, it doesn’t linger. What do you recommend to your patients who absorb gum through a semi-permeable membrane using a process known as osmosis? In other words, what do you tell your amoeba patients? Sorry, or your paramecium. I just don’t wanna get that… “I’m a paramecia. “A zillion of us came to Gary Gulman’s early show, “and we were so disappointed “that he acknowledged the amoebas, “but ignored almost half of the unicellular organism community.” “This was a slight I felt deep in my ribosome…” “…and mitochondria. My husband was literally pulling his cilia out.” Many of you sat in science class in eighth grade and thought, “When are we gonna need this?” June 22nd… 2020… I’m gonna dub in whatever year it is. Every year, I’m gonna… “Four,” so it’ll be, “This guy, he’s unbelievable.” ’24. But I have, I have a strong empathy. It might be– Sometimes, it gets in the way of enjoying things, and I, I think, “Well, I can’t enjoy certain things.” Like, I don’t– I’ve been upgraded to first class sometimes because I have all these miles from traveling, and I just don’t enjoy a moment of it because I feel like kind of a traitor to my class. And I’m-I’m incredibly insecure, and I’ve spent so much time walking through first class and just judging and, and making up stories in my head. And I don’t mean to ',\n",

For an extra $135, usually, I can get the legroom that prevents me from having my legs amputated because of blood clots. I cannot sit in-in the coach class. It just doesn’t work for me. So, I’m going to my Comfort Plus seat. I get so anxious and embittered. I always say, “Honey, don’t be impressed with these people. “If they had their shit together, they’d be in a private jet right now.” “They all have bosses. They all have bosses. “Don’t be dazzled by their Tommy Bahama polo shirts. These are not people to be impressed with.” The sad part is I’m almost always traveling alone when I do that. I can’t because of the empathy. I’m always boycotting things because I feel bad for enjoying things because of what they represent. I-I won’t drive a Mercedes-Benz. Even if I could afford one, I would not drive a Mercedes-Benz. Just so we’re all on the same page, Mercedes-Benz was not neutral during the Holocaust. They chose a side, and I, and I’m not going to– If you’re a Jew and you drive a Mercedes-Benz, please just tell me you won it in a raffle. I cannot… abide… Jews driving Mercedes-Benzes. I’m always boycotting things. I used to watch the NFL every Sunday from between four and 14 hours and… And then, they banned Colin Kaepernick from making a very reasonable protest by taking a knee. And I said, well, I’m done with that group. And the thing that’s aggravating is my boycotts never work. They’re having another Super Bowl. It’s already been given a date. I became vegan after seeing this documentary called “Food, Inc.” I saw how they were treating the chickens, and I said, “Well, that’s the end of that.” And I– Oh, man, I loved, I loved those foods. But then, I said, “I can’t. I can’t be a part of that.” Then, I saw a picture of a sea turtle in “National Geographic,” and it had a plastic straw stuck in its, in its cute little nostril, and they had to use a pliers to take it out. And I thought',\n",
              "  ', “Oh, that could have been my plastic straw from a…” Right? It could’ve been any of our… …plastic straws. And I made a vow that day. I say, “From here on out, it will not be one of my plastic straws.” And people, when I told them I’m off plastic straws, they go, “What do you do about smoothies?” And I said, “Well, I-I put a moratorium on smoothies until I– until I could figure it out.” And what I figured out was that this, this stainless steel straw is the answer. It’s a a really good suck. By the way, I have no dog in the sea turtle fight. None of my ancestors are sea turtles. But the empathy, oy. So, I use this, and I-I love it. For $14.99, I got four of these, and it comes with a free pipe cleaner which answers your question, “How do you keep it clean?” Free pipe cleaner. So, look at me. I’m not only saving the majestic sea turtle, but also the near defunct… …the moribund pipe cleaner industry. The– The pipe cleaner industry was on its last legs. And here’s what’s so precious about the pipe cleaner industry’s last legs. It’s made out of a pipe cleaner. It’s made out of a pipe cleaner. And what they did was they took the points, and they, they folded it up so it looks like feet. Empathy. The thing with empathy is that… certain things, they hit you so hard, you feel it, and it can limit you. Like, because of my empathy, I can’t watch… close-up magic anymore. Which sounds like a non-sequitur, but it’s a sequitur. Okay, I have been a fan of magic as long as I’ve been… coherent, and I used to be a-a magician when I was a kid. Like a lotta kids, I had tricks, and I had a magic set, and I would make tricks from books and things like that, and I would practice all the time. And then one Passover, on, I think, night two at a seder, I asked my dad if I could put on a little magic show after the– Of course, I would do my job. I would ask the four questions, but then after the seder, after Dayenu say… “Gulman got really Jewy.” “I thought his base was librarians.” “It’s middle',\n",
              "  '-aged Jews.” I asked my father if I could do a magic show, and he said, “I, I don’t know, son. It might be a sacrilege to do magic on Passover.” And my argument was, I said, “Dad, “what was Moses’ splitting of the Red Sea but the greatest ta-da…” “…in Jewish history?” And he, and he laughed, and he said, “Keep it tight.” Okay, so I was doing the magic tricks, and my brothers were sitting there and just calling out every single trick. “What’s in your other hand? Roll up your sleeve. What did you just drop?” And I was 7. You’re picturing them being 10 or 11, which is obnoxious, but forgivable. They were 20 and 23. The gift you have given me tonight, that I can be myself. Like, you enjoy my jokes, but you also enjoy me, which is just– I don’t know if you know what goes on… I don’t know if you know what goes on before the show, but I, I say a little prayer of gratitude. And then, then I remind myself of something my therapist always tells me, which is, um, “The audience, Gary, they’re not your family.” “These people are rooting for you.” So, this was why I stopped doing magic, I couldn’t, I couldn’t handle the heckling. I still loved magic all my years. And I-I remember the last time I went to a magic show. I was so moved. I went to this show at the Magic Castle in Hollywood. And the young man did this trick. And it sounds basic, but it was very complicated, and I knew how much effort must have gone into perfecting it. So, he does this thing. He says, “Pick a card, any card.” I pick the queen of diamonds. And then he handed me the queen of diamonds and a Sharpie and asked me to sign the back of the card. And so, I did that. Then he took the card with my signature and the Sharpie, put it into the deck, and did a series of elaborate shuffles, culminating in the cascading bridge. The… My sound effects are so poor. Cascading bridge, which I can’t do and makes me less of a man. Sometimes, people will ask me, they’ll say, “Gary, do you wanna play poker with us?” And I’ll say, “',\n",
              "  'Oh, I don’t, I don’t gamble.” But the truth is I don’t shuffle. But, this guy, his cascading bridge, it was just perfection. So, he takes the deck, and then he put it into the pocket. This pocket in his blazer. From this pocket, he removed an orange. And I screamed, “How?!” “I just saw you put the deck into this pocket. I watched every moment of it from here to here. Now, you’re implying it’s in the middle of that orange?” When I told my mom this story, she said, “Gar, honey, how’d you know the card was in the orange?” And I said, “Oh, that’s because I– I’ve seen magic before, you dingbat.” He didn’t pull out the orange ’cause he was concerned I had scurvy. “Bullocks to Gulman, who so blithely mentioned scurvy.” “A vitamin C deficiency that ravaged the British Royal Navy “in the 17th and 18th centuries. “First, he went after ‘Seinfeld,’ and I said nothin’.” “‘Cause I weren’t ‘Seinfeld.’ “Then, he went after dentists, and I said nothin’ ’cause I don’t care for them blokes neither. Then, he came for me.” “Also, I thought it was a low blow and petty and spiteful that he mocked those of us who still sent our emails using a manual typewriter.” “And while I don’t wanna stoop to his level and pick nits, but ‘is mime work is rubbish!” “He would have his audience of librarians and middle-aged Jewish women believe that we return the carriage after every bloody letta!” “And that we only type words that could be typed entirely with the left ‘and, such as west and steward and abracadabra.” So, he hands me the orange. And he says, “Inspect it, make sure it hasn’t been doctored or manipulated in any way.” I said, “What can I prove?” “Without… “Without an MRI, “I got nothing.

It’s– I know it sounds counterintuitive, but when you don’t believe in yourself, you’re so shocked when you come through, you’re like, “Yeah, in your face!” Like, I’ve been obnoxious about that. Like, when I was in high school, if I– uh, playing basketball, if I made a shot over you, and I, I would have… …and your coach called timeout to staunch the bleeding… …I wouldn’t go over to my huddle. I would go over to your huddle, stick my beak in, and say, “I’d bring in someone who can guard me.” And sometimes, the referee would come over and say, “Son, you pull that again, I’m gonna tee you up.” And I would say, “Pull what? Offer sage defensive counsel?” Sometimes, I’d go to the free throw line, I’d make the first one, and then, I’d turn to whoever fouled me and say, “Regrets?” “We could all be playing basketball right now if you’d shown a little self-control.” “I’m gonna make this next one, “even though your fans and cheerleaders are screaming, “Miss!” Lemme tell you something, kids. While you were all at prom and semi-formal and the Enchantment Under the Sea dance, I was keeping my elbow in… …and following through. I’m not gonna miss. You know what I consider a miss? If it hits any part of the rim before falling through the net. That’s my miss. It has to be esthetically pleasing as well as go through the points. If it hits, if it goes “g-g-g-g-g, I’ll cover my ears and scream, “Too loud!” Now, that’s high school basketball. The stakes are very low. If I pulled your card out of citrus fruit in front of an audience, I’m not, “Is this your card?” I’d whip it out with a flourish. Look familiar, fuckface? How did I do it? I’m magic! Now, you’re wondering where, where does the empathy come in? He said, “Is this your card?” And I felt it. I, I wanted to say, “Not only is that my card, “this is the greatest trick I’ve ev',\n",

You said, “Is this your card?” I heard, “Mommy, look! Mommy!” “Mommy! Mommy!” So, I’m, I’m gonna start this special, but what I’ve noticed with some of the-the specials I’ve seen of, of comedians that I really admire, they-they kinda start in medias res. So you don’t even hear the-the, the– In ninth grade, I learned in medias res. I think it means in the middle of things, but sounds much nicer. Anyhow, a lot of comedians are starting that way, and I think it’s, I think it’s kinda jazzy. So, like, the special might start with me going, “It’s kinda jazzy.” And then, there’s like mystery of the people who weren’t here, thinking, “I wonder– I wonder what I missed?” ♪ Into tomorrows and ♪ ♪ Take it as it goes… ♪ Your email address will not be published.

I want you guys to feel that. This only works if we feel like family. I know the camera’s here and it’s a whole thing. It’s a big night, it’s a lot of pressure. That kinda thing, you know? I want you guys to feel as comfortable as I hope to be. We got a lot of shit to talk about. I’m happy you’re here. I need you. I wanna talk about secrets! Secrets! I should whisper it, right? I carried a lot of secrets my whole life. I feel like I was birthed into them. One of my biggest, one of my last held secrets is my name. My name is not Jerrod. Welcome to the show, everybody. I thought we were being honest tonight. Jerrod’s my middle name. I was given the name Jerrod by my brother, Joe. He’s, like, seven years older than me. They just trusted a kid to name a kid, but whatever. I’m thankful for that. Without him I’d have to go by my real name, my first name, which we don’t talk about. It is not good. I don’t like it. I’ve always hated that name, no one calls me that except for my mom. My dad named me… He combined his dad’s first name and my mom’s dad’s first name and mushed them together. Not to make something elegant, like William Edward or something like that. It’s more like Toyotathon. I hate t',\n",
              "  'hat name. I’ve hidden that name my whole life. I used to get it removed from the yearbook. Every year in high school I would bribe somebody. It’d cost me 20 dollars to get my first name taken out of it. I never let people see my driver’s license. I had it taken off my bank cards. I’ve always been ashamed of it. I’ve always hidden it. And it’s funny because it’s a name given to me to honor two people. It’s supposed to be this gift to both my granddads. And it almost seemed kind of fucked up that I hide that, that I like tuck it away, but that’s because you don’t know my grandfathers. If you knew them, you’d know keeping a secret is the only way to honor them. That’s kind of who they were. They were granddads. I’m named after two men who most of their lives, most of their sex lives at least were secrets. My mom’s dad had four kids with my mom’s mom, his wife, and four kids outside of that marriage, just kind of scattered about. My dad’s dad had five kids with his wife and about 23 outside of the marriage. Yeah. I come from a long line of cool n*ggers. 23. Dillon, South Carolina. Jim Gowens is his name. We don’t have the same last name because my dad was an outside kid. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. There’s no easy way to say your grandma was a side piece. I wanna say it was something else. They’d prefer I used terms like “affair” and whatever, but n',\n",
              "  'ah, that’s not what it was. She was fuckin’ a married n*gger and that’s just… So my grandma had three kids by a married man, my uncle Pete, my dad, my aunt Nell, and his wife found out and confronted my grandma about it. I like to think it was on some “Color Purple” shit, like she crossed the field or whatever. But she confronted my grandma and demanded that she stop sleeping with her man, and my grandma fucked him again and had my Aunt Cat. I think she’s where I get my ambition from. My aunt Cat is proud of that, by the way. She’ll tell everybody her origin story. She’s like: “Don’t nobody tell me who to sleep with.” “And then she fucked him again and had me out of spite.” “That’s me, I’m the spite baby.” She loves that shit. But we don’t really talk about it. We don’t really talk about it. My dad doesn’t really know his dad, but he still felt enough pride to name me after him. My mom’s dad was also like a cheater, but she lived in the house that he was cheating from. And so when you’re that family, you learn not to say shit. My mom, I guess, learned from her mom. I’m trying to paint a picture of a world before Destiny’s Child, where women got cheated on and it didn’t play out like a Terry McMillan novel. It was much more quiet than that. They just kind of existed with the secret. They knew, but they didn’t know. It’s weird, it’s like gener',\n",

I came home from school early. I would watch my dad… If you got a dad or an older brother, they might’ve had a porn stash. This was the ’90s. My dad kept his tapes in a Nike box in the bedroom closet on the top shelf, beside a gun and a jar of nickels. And I remember putting this tape in, and it was about 15 seconds before I started recognizing the bedroom. I know those sheets, they got lemons on them. But that’s the thing, I never told my family. I never told my parents that I’d seen that. It’s odd because it’s one of those things… You can’t talk about sex with your parents, not that anybody really wants to, but you just can’t. And you’re only here because your parents fucked, isn’t that kinda funny? Your dad came in your mom and you’re here. Have you ever been watching a movie with your parents and a sex scene came on and you just gotta be, like, “nope, no it’s not”. Things that exist, but don’t exist. It’s things that are right there, hiding in plain sight. My father had me and my brother with my mom, and then he had four kids with a bitch named Raneta. It’s not that I hate her name. It’s just that it sounds like a villain in a Tyler Perry movie. And other kids, he had other kids. ',\n",
              "  'My dad was, he was really out there, man. He was really, really out there. And I knew about it since I was a kid. It was a small town, and it’s a secret that he thought he was keeping from the family. He thought he was doing a good job keeping the secret. But I found out. I never told him that I knew. My brother found out. He didn’t tell him. It’s funny to live in a house with someone knowing who they are, knowing that they’re cheating on your mom and not saying anything to him. He used to go out on Friday nights, he would say he was going to work. My dad is a truck driver, which by the way, if you’re cheating on your wife and you’re looking for a profession that allows just long blackout dates, get your CDLs and hit the road. I really recommend it. He would say he was going to a second job on Friday nights, but he would get dressed up, and I mean dressed up by North Carolina dad standards. He tucked his t-shirt into his jeans. He would say he was going to work with cologne on. Do you understand what I’m saying? It’s just, like, a liar. And it would just leave me as a kid knowing that… It’s weird to know it, to know, to really, really know, and not say anything. I was scared. I didn’t know what to say. I don’t know what I could’ve done. I don’t know if I would’ve said anything if I had the courage, because I only saw this secret as something',\n",
              "  ' that could’ve torn our family apart. If my mom found out, I thought it would be over. He was fucking my homeboy TJ’s aunt. This was this story TJ told me about, and that’s hard because TJ, he didn’t want to snitch. In the hood… I didn’t wanna snitch! He told me, he was like: “Man, I came home from school the other day” “and I went to my aunt’s house” “and your pop was just there on the couch.” What? He’s like: “Yeah, yeah, yeah, he was just on the couch.” He saw my dad sitting on the couch. He walks in, he’s excited to see my dad. He knows my dad very well, they used to play Madden together. He knows him. He’s like: “Mr. Carmichael, what are you doing here?” And my dad, being caught, under pressure, you know what he did? He just squinted his eyes and pretended he was somebody else. I don’t know how that was supposed to work. He literally was just like: “Mr. Carmichael? I don’t know who you’re talking about.” He just grabbed his shit and got the fuck outta there. My father. And TJ was there with his aunt and he said: “Do you know who that was?” “That’s my best friend’s dad. That’s Joe Carmichael.” And she said: “Joe Carmichael?” “He told me his name was Jerry Rice.” That’s right, that’s right. My father was telling bitches his name was Hall of Fame wide receiver Jerry Rice. Do you know how absurd that is? And I got so many questions, things ',\n",
              "  'he won’t talk about. Did you say it? Did you act surprised? “Did you go: What? There’s another Jerry Rice?” Was it all part of the game? Did he go: “Yeah, my name is Jerry Rice. I know. I get it all the time.” How did he react? He was a wild man, he was really out there, really, really out there, just holding it in, just holding it all in. He had a double or triple bypass surgery, I guess that’s where it went. It’s fine. I’m paying for his health insurance. Don’t groan for the man. I’m keeping him alive right now. I made him tell my mom. It became too much. It’s a secret that I think I was happy keeping as a child because I thought it made sense for the family, but then it was embarrassing, first of all. Because people knew. It seems like everyone knew, but my mom, and that’s really tough because my mom is a very sweet, loving, trusting, Christian, God-fearing woman, who was just standing by her man, trusting her husband. And my dad was just, you know, he was really out there. I got really drunk in London and I was like: “It’s time.” “I’m gonna confront him about it.” And it’s hard. This was hard because this is a tough man. Again, he kept a sawed-off shotgun in the closet by the porn, and it’s not easy. It’s not easy. I was really afraid, but I remember starting the call saying: “Listen, this will all go well as long as you don’t lie to me.',\n",
              "  '” And I was just almost in tears and just so emotional. “I know about everything, man. I know about Renita,” “and the kids, and the blah blah blah,.” You know what he said? He actually said: “I always knew you’d be the one.” That’s what he said. He knew. So I made him tell my mom. He waited until I was back home in North Carolina to tell her, fucking pussy. I know, that’s a pussy thing to do, right? He waited. He needed the support. He waited until I was home. And this was his big plan to tell my mom. He was like: “Okay, so you and your brother, you take her out to dinner.” “I’m gonna stay home. And then you bring her back from dinner.” “You drop her off, she’ll come in the house, and then I’m gonna tell her.” And I was like: “Okay, you want me to hide a gun behind the toilet, too?” “What kinda Godfather plan is this?” But I went along with it. It took a lot for him. That dinner was the worst dinner I’ve ever had in my entire life. I took my mom to a hibachi restaurant. Earlier that day, I had taken my nieces to see the “Trolls” movie. I love going to the movies with my nieces. It’s the best. They’re not my kids so I can just get high and do fun shit with them, it’s the best. And we’d seen the “Trolls” movie, and I don’t know if you’ve seen it, spoiler alert. The premise is that these are these colorful trolls that are singing and all types ',\n",
              "  'of shit, and if something devastating happens to them, they lose all of their color. I remember thinking that the whole dinner, that whole night is just looking at my mom, just looking in her eyes going: “She’s going to lose her color.” It was really, really scary. Mind you, all of this happened at a hibachi grill, so I’m looking in her eyes, but there’s a flame and we gotta clap every couple minutes. He’s juggling salt and pepper shakers. “Yay, okay. My mom is about to be fucking destroyed,” “but this is a great trick.” I get mad when I don’t get a Japanese chef. Sometimes they’re Mexican and they’re just passing them off as… Anyway. How many Japanese chefs are there in North Carolina? I’m piecing this together now. I brought her home. I dropped her off. I went to my brother’s house, and we waited by the phone very, very anxiously, me, my brother, and sister-in-law just waited, very nervous. And then my mom called. I could hear in her voice that she’d been crying. And I’ll never forget, her first words were: “I’m okay.” And he told her, begged for her forgiveness. She forgave him, she stayed. It’s kinda anti-climactic, I know. She actually made him breakfast the next morning. I’ll never forget that fact. And mostly because it’s an embarrassing fact to admit. It’s not how I thought the story would play out. It’s somehow worse. But it was out',\n",
              "  ' in the open. And once that was done, I was left alone feeling like a liar because I had a secret, one that I kept from my mother, and my father, and my family, my friends, and you, all of you, professionally, personally. And the secret is that I’m gay. Thank you for that. We love you. That’s very sweet. I really appreciate that. It means a lot. And I’m accepting the love, I really appreciate the love. My, kind of, ego wants to rebel against it, you clap and you’re very sweet and you’re very kind, and I appreciate it. Part of me wants to be like: “I’m fucking gay.” “I’m not fucking retarded.” Because I can feel it, bro. I can feel it. There’s a lot that happens coming out. I’m telling you guys and I see the Yankee fitteds. Some of y’all are just like: “Shit, we at a gay show, bro?” This is for HBO. You know how many n*ggers just turned the TV off saying to their girl right now “we gotta watch something else”? Like, y’all clapped. A lot of you clapped and you felt it. Some of you didn’t really wanna clap. You were just like: “We gotta do that shit. We’re in New York and there’s cameras.” That’s okay, I get it. I came out to my friends. We love you. I wanna accept that, you know? It feels like I didn’t earn it. It’s like, what did I do, suck a Dominican dude’s dick? And then y’all clapped for that, you know? Because I rebelled against that. I ',\n",
              "  'really did, bro, I rebelled against it my whole life. I never thought I’d come out. I didn’t think I’d ever, ever, ever come out. Probably at many points in my life I thought I’d rather die than confront the truth of that. I didn’t actually say it to people, because I know it changes people’s, some people, it changes their perception of me. I can’t control that. I’m from an environment where I was, kind of, raised to be a man, whatever that means. Didn’t expect gay babies, you know what I’m saying? You don’t see old ladies looking at a toddler being, like: “Look at his cheeks. I bet he’s gonna be a top.” “Get that baby some prep now.” I feel you, bro. I’m with you. I’m from the hood. Sometimes I’ll be in the shower like: “N*gger, I’m really gay. Fuck, dude!” You know? Shit is shocking to me, too. I didn’t know. It’s fucked up all my relationships. I had a boyfriend, me and that n*gga talked to each other like men. We’d say shit like: “I wanna suck your dick, bro.” None of that gay shit over here. Sometimes we’re making out and just whispering “no homo” to each other. Just tonguing that n*gger down being, like, “pause”. I feel you. I got mostly straight friends. Them n*ggers didn’t wanna hear that shit. My homeboy, Jamar, said… This is one of my best friends. I let him sleep on my couch when he needed it. I was always there for him. He told m',\n",

He said: “I would’ve never signed up for this.” And I said: “N*gger, you owe me 85000 dollars.” Gotta accept the love, man. I need the love. I need it. I was really out here lying, though. That’s the thing, I came out too late, a little too late. That “it gets better shit is for the kids”. That’s not for an adult man figuring himself out. They don’t want that. Nobody wants that shit. All my friends felt like I was just duplicitous, like I was just lying to them. They didn’t know who I was. They all reacted like Sally Field in Mrs. Doubtfire. They were like: “The whole time?” They were very mad about that shit. It cleared up my relationship with all my black homegirls. My friend Ashley told me before I came out she could sense it. She was like: “Please just tell me you’re gay so this all makes sense.” I guess there are only so many times you can Facetime a woman to see if your outfit looks okay before they start having some questions. They were the toughest. Black women were the toughest people to come out to, but also the most supportive. I’m very, very thankful for all of the black ladies in my life who have supported me through that, through all of it, all of it. They’re not homophobic at all. They’re racist as a motherfucker. They don’t like that I had a white boyfriend. See? Yo',\n",
              "  'u see what I’m saying? You see that change? You can be gay, but n*gger, what? You date white boys, really? Is that a shock? Surprise, surprise. No more secrets. I’m gonna tell you all. You heard her say “wow”? That’s the sound of a Black woman that feels doubly betrayed. My sister is on that shit, too. Listen, I’m used to it. I grew up just in the hood on some real strong masculine shit. It plays out. Look, I’ll say this, I actually think that it is important to say this, I believe in the black family. I think that black men should marry black women, and have black babies and raise them to be smart, just good citizens, educated. I think that’s very, very important. A hundred percent. I think gay black men should be able to fuck whoever the fuck we want. What is the consequence? There are no black babies coming from the kind of sex I have, okay? It’s all getting flushed. It doesn’t matter. Doesn’t matter. The black girls, they try. I would send them pictures of my boyfriend and they would ignore that he’s white. They would just be like… I remember I sent a picture to my homegirl Tiffany and she was like: “He got some pretty glasses.” I was like: “Nah, bitch, it’s not the glasses.” “Look at the skin of my vanilla king.” I didn’t call him that. I’m hiding nothing from you guys. But your name. Now you guys are too much like my family. Let’s go b',\n",

He’s there for me as much as he can be. He tries. He tries and I love him. I love him a lot. I love Joe so much. He’s all I got in a lot of this. I wish he’d try harder. I’m probably a little mad at him, a little bit mad. He’s my big brother, he’s supposed to protect me. He loves me despite, that’s the thing. It’s a little condescending, you know? It’s love with an asterisk. “I don’t really fuck with the gay shit, but I still love you.” That’s that masculine shit. I could feel the distance between us. And I hate that because no one would want that. It makes me feel unwanted. It makes me feel like something is wrong with me. It’s like he’s looking down on me and accepting me despite. It’s especially hurtful just because I make so much more money than this n*gger. It’s not even close. I don’t wanna be gross and talk about money, but the difference is millions and millions of dollars. I love my brother a lot. He’s a nice guy. Nice as… I’m saying that.

I like spending time with them because I’m not hiding anything when I’m with them, I’m just with them. We’re just there playing. We’re just eating ice cream or they’re trying to braid my hair. They are easy to talk about it with, you know? Joliette, there’s no pre-tense. It’s harder with the older ones. I came out to my dad again. I say again, cause he forgets. It’s cognitive dissonance. I have to remind him. I have to re-up every so often. There’s a part of him that likes that I came out. I don’t think he necessarily wants a gay son, but he likes that me coming out takes some of the heat off him. Like when he first found out he was like “no, it’s cool”, “I fucked up, you fucked up”. “You gay, I did what I did… Que sera…” My father’s dream is that I’m bi. That’s all he wants. That’s all he wants, the hope, somewhere on the horizon, that I’m still getting pussy. That’s all he wants. He’s probably actually disappointed in both of me and my brother. He’s probably looking at us like: “Wait, so you gay and you only fuck your wife?” “What kinda nerds am I raising here?” I told my dad, I said: “I know two things for a fact.” “I will never be an astronaut and I’m a gay man.” And',\n",

I love her a lot. I love her dearly. And I’m trying to describe her without sounding cliché and describe the love that I have for her. I really feel like I was one of her closest friends. I feel like I have always looked out for her. I remember on the call, the last time I talked about being gay with my Mom, she said: “I can’t go against Jesus.” And it just bothers me. I get it, cause she’s… She’s doing the best she can. I think. She’s trying to accept. I don’t know what she’s trying to do. I think she’s trying to accept it. Part of me knows she’s at home trying to pray the gay away. I get a little mad sometimes. Any time I don’t match with a dude on RIA I’m like: “I bet that bitch over there praying to God.” I feel it too. It fucks with me because this is a religion that I still believe in. I’m still a Christian and it’s taken a lot, it’s taken a whole lot because I’ve had to reconfigure God and what God is and what he means in order to accept myself. I had to kind of rebuild. And with my mom… I’m sorry. A lot of it is not really… It’s kinda happening in real time, so it’s not totally worked out. Forgive me. I think she’s… She thinks not reacting is the best reac',\n",

It’s not just nice. It’s not pleasant, it’s real and that feels… I think that would feel better. I wish she would yell at me. I wish she would tell me to not come home. I wish she’d call me a f*ggot like my Uncle June Bug did. Yeah. It hurt my feelings, but I was like: “N*gga, your name June Bug.” I’d rather get called a f*ggot than June Bug. Anything, anything, anything. She’s nice. She’s sweet. She ignores it. The worst of her is cold, like really, really cold. I mean she’s a nice lady, but like, there’s a part of her that’s really… She can shut people out. She can ignore, she can block and like, go inside. But you gave yourself so many years. Why don’t you give her that time? I’d love to give her all the time in the world, you know? I don’t know how much time it would take. I don’t know how much time we have left. Just in general, one of my biggest fears is my parents funeral, just the thought of one them dying without saying everything, without contending, without expressing it all. And my mom’s in her early sixties and she has time and she’s… I also just don’t know if that’s when people change. They do. Maybe. I don’t know. It sounds like a joke, but like part ',\n",

On the news… And you’re like: “Bitch, now?” “Good luck in the fucking job market.” It’s not that I don’t find hope for change, but I think even if she was young, there’s a part of my mom that’s very, very cold. I know it because I have it, I can be that. That’s why my last real secret is that I’m… People think I’m nice. Nah, I’m like my Mom. Fuck everybody. Very selfish. Very, very, very, very selfish. I smile. Very polite about it. I lie to everybody face. “Yeah, we should get dinner!” You know, lies. How you lie to people? I’m afraid of not… Man, just like my Mom, is that performance of like who you’re supposed to be. Like I’m afraid of not smiling. I smile a lot. I feel like if I don’t smile, I look like the n*ggers that shot Malcom X. I know. I’m afraid of things getting awkward. Like weird. Like even this moment, I’m like “man, I should probably think of a joke”. Shit is falling apart out here. Do you wish you didn’t tell her? No, no. I stayed in the closet for a long time. I think because of my mom I felt like… It’s not like I could bring a dude home to her, so what’s the point? But as much as she believes in God, I believe in personal growth and feeling free. I feel freer. We say things like: “Sometimes you grow and',\n",
              "  ' you gotta leave people behind.” “People are in your life for a reason or a season.” Or these kinds of cliché sayings. It’s hard when that person is your mom. You think a lot of the guilt is your dad’s guilt? I carry some guilt. I think because I was complicit in the lie, I guess. I thought I was protecting her. I always felt like my mom’s protector. I always felt like… I’m trying to explain this concept. I always felt like… I always felt like the result of her prayers. My mom, one of her favorite Bible verses is, I think it’s Jeremiah Chapter 33: “Ask me and I will tell you things you don’t know and can’t find out.” Do you think without your mom’s approval you’ll be okay? That eventually this will be something that you’ll be okay with? I think without my mom’s approval… I’d like to believe I will be okay. I think I’ve spent a lot of time trying to supplement that love and I’m very thankful because I have some very, very good friends. Really, really good people who are there… I think it’s something that I kind of search for. When there’s distance between me and my mom, it’s the times I feel the most like an orphan. I feel abandoned. I’m sorry, that laugh was fake. I’m trying to make jokes. I wish this moment weren’t so weird, man. I think like, what do I want from her? I know she’ll see this. I don’t know what will happen. You guys got any i',\n",
              "  'deas? I don’t know what else to… I’ve been trying to be very honest because my whole life was shrouded in secrets. And I figured the only route I haven’t tried was the truth, so I’m saying everything. Here’s everything. I feel okay. I’m very thankful for tonight. Rothaniel. My name’s Rothaniel.

And– Another hand for the most overqualified opening act, Mr. Lewis Black. [cheering] And another hand for Jann Arden, who couldn’t be here to sing that in real life but was nice enough to send that to me in the computer. And a big hand for you people that are borderline alcoholics. You’ve made it out tonight. [cheering] You’ve– [cheering continues] I do feel a kinship. This is a beer town. I’m from a beer town. I’m actually from St. Louis, Missouri. [cheering] Thank you. You like that. Specifically, I’m from very near Ferguson. Maybe you saw our travel brochure. People are like, “Really? Are you really from there?” Yeah, I am. They’re like, “Can you believe all that happened?” Yeah, I can. I can’t believe we kept a lid on that shit for 25 years. Every day I felt the tension. Every day. Even In high school, I came home and I said, “I don’t really know if our school’s that safe anymore, Dad. A girl got stabbed to death in the third-floor bathroom.” He didn’t stop doing the crossword puzzle. He goes, “Well, don’t use that bathroom. What are you, a goddamn idiot, Kathleen? Jesus Christ. Use your mind.” It’s not a very exciting state, Missouri. It’s really just in the middle– Clearly, though, to Southerners it’s not. I was in Birmingham, Alabama. I get done with the show, and this guy at the bar goes, “Ma’am, I could tell by the way you talk you’re a Yankee.” I’m like, “Sir, I’m from Missouri. And let me tell you this little piece of history. I don’t even know if we were in the war. I think we were half and half and just beat the crap out of one another. We never even left our own property, sir.” “Fight Local.” That was our bumper sticker. “Fight Local.” ’Cause we couldn’t decide. We were half Confederate and half Union. We still can’t decide. CNN had a map of the Syrian refugee crisis, a map of the United States, and who would take them and who wouldn’t. The South, yellow. No. The Northeast said yes, we’ll take ’em. Blue. For no reason explained till the very end of the show, Missouri was purple. The only state. And then at the end, they go, “Oh, the purple signifies no decision. They can’t make up their minds.” Of course we can’t make up our minds. I don’t really consider, um– I don’t know what I consider. I don’t know if it’s north or south. But I know sometimes when I’m in the South, I see things on bumper stickers, I read things in their newspaper where I think to myself, seriously, I think we m',\n",
              "  'ay need to have this Civil War again. I’m not sure they got it. I feel like it’s beating up a drunk in an alley and then wake up and be like, “That was bullshit. I wasn’t ready. Come back.” No. No, drunky. We’re not coming back. I was in Louisiana, and you can google this. ’Cause I couldn’t believe this was true. It is true. They are teaching children in schools in Louisiana that will accept vouchers. So that’s tax money. They’re private schools, but they accept vouchers. This is in science class. Now, put on your science hat and try to follow this syllogism. They’re teaching the kids that the Loch Ness Monster is real. Now, as an aside, I agree with that. But nobody taught me that. I had to stay up really late watching the Discovery Channel, drinking a lot of wine and weeding through a lot of crap to make my decision. Anyway, they’re teaching the children that the Loch Ness Monster is real. Therefore, evolution is not real ’cause the Loch Ness Monster is a dinosaur. I don’t even have a joke for that. I just want you to know that. Those are fellow Americans that I think should be airlifted out. I– Someone needs to get the children. Leave the adults. Take the children. My state is not a state that you really wanna brag about. We just try to lay low. That’s our best outcome: if we’re not noticed. Because every time– Like Ferguson, that whole thing. That was not exactly something that you feel proud of. Uh, two summers ago, I turned on CNN somewhere on the road, and it said, “Missouri State Senate debates–” Now, you think the next word would be “health care” or “right-to-work clause.” No. “Noodling.” Yeah. We spent two weeks, eight hours a day, the senate. For those of you who don’t know what noodling is, congratulations. You have led a very classy life. But I’m gonna tell you what it is. Noodling is when hillbilly people get in muddy rivers, like the Mississippi or the Missouri River, and they get into water about chest high and then they go along the riverbank with their hands underneath the water searching for catfish breeding holes. Then when they find one, they shove their arm in the hole. They wait for the catfish to bite it. Then they yank it out and they’ve caught a fish. I was not aware that this is illegal in my home state of Missouri. I was also not aware that it is legal in our neighboring state of Oklahoma. I certainly was not aware that we have a Missouri Noodlers Association. CNN sent a young reporter to interview the president of the Missouri Noodlers Association, who immediately became my new hero because for his interview on CNN, he chose not to wear a shirt. [audience cheering] She was clearly petrified of the guy. I have never seen anyone hold a microphone further away from another human being. She said, “Sir, I understand you’re the president of the Missouri Noodlers Association. Could you please tell us your position on noodling?” He goes, “Yeah. Yea',\n",
              "  'h. I’ll tell you my position. If I wanna shove my arm in a hole and get a fish, you tell my why I can’t.” So that was the argument for it. Then I thought, what is the problem? I don’t know. Well, they go interview the people against it. It was, like, basically an environmental group, and they go, “Well, our problem with it is two-fold. Number one, every time they do this, they’re destroying the catfish breeding holes. And number two, and more importantly, sometimes these catfish, especially if near a dam, can grow to be 150 to 250 pounds.” Yes. I swear. Google it. “So sometimes when the hillbilly shoves his arm in the hole, the hillbilly does not come back up.” But I was like, “Yeah, but let’s think that through. What have we gained and what have we lost?” Everything– [applause] “We might have lost Billy Bob, but somebody just got his brand-new truck full of Busch light.” What? I don’t expect people to know much about Missouri. I do expect people to know it’s a state. That I do. And there are people– I was in California, in a Macy’s, trying to buy jeans. And the girl was young, I’ll give her that. [imitating valley girl] She was one of the girls who talk like that, and she just couldn’t be bothered with anything, okay? [normal voice] I go to check out and I give her my credit card. She goes, “I’m gonna need to see your license.” I go, “Okay, that’s not a problem.” And I– I’m still not sure exactly what happened. I’m gonna show you what happened. I gave her my license, and she went, “Missouri.” [clicks teeth] “Uh… no.” “No? Did you just do a search in your brain and your hard drive came back with nothing, so you negated my whole state?” “Uh, no.” Missouri is a very special place to one group of people, and it’s the Mormons. Not the ones that went to Utah. Joseph Smith, the leader, had a son, Joseph Smith, Jr. That man believed that the original Garden of Eden was 35 miles north of Kansas City. Not in Mesopotamia. No, no, no, no, no. Missouri. They also believe that when Christ comes back, that’s where he’s going. First stop, Kansas City. He’s not gonna go to Bethlehem or Jerusalem. He’s getting a Southwest flight and he’s going straight to Kansas City. Look, I am from Missouri. And if you think Jesus is going back to Kansas City, 35 miles outside of it, by the way, then you must believe that Jesus is a big fan of barbecue and crystal meth, because that is what’s happening 35 miles outside of Kansas City. My whole family lives there. Well, my parents are in Florida in the winter right now. As most Midwest old people with a car, they leave on December 26. They’re like geese. They just leave. Flocks of ’em leave from the Midwest. My parents bought a new car. They haven’t had a new car in ten years. They bought a black Lincoln Town Car. Little did they know that that’s one of the more expensive rides on the Uber app. So I, unbeknownst to them, have signed them up to be Uber',\n",
              "  ' drivers… so they can pick up other old people on the way to Florida, make a little spending cash. ’Cause my mom will do whatever the phone says, I’m telling you. “Jack, we have to pull over. We’re the blue dot, and it’s saying pull over. There are people that need a ride for some reason. I don’t know why the phone is doing this. It’s never done this before. But I’m afraid if we don’t, there’s gonna be a problem, Jack.” They go to Sarasota now, on that side. But for about three years in a row, they went to a place called the Villages. I don’t know if any of you’ve seen it advertised on TV. Go to their Web site. There’s nothing like it in the world. It’s the largest retirement community in the nation. Well, the world, probably. It’s 35 minutes, or if my mom’s driving, eight and a half hours away from the Orlando airport. Some guy thought of it. He thought, “I’m gonna buy all of this crappy swampland, and I’m gonna make nirvana for old people. I’ll build it. They will come.” And they came. There’s 350,000 of ’em. They have their own zip code. They have their own post office. They’ve got golf courses, swimming pools. I mean, it’s really something. It really is something. And my parents were there, and I go, “Oh, good. You’re gonna be at the Villages. That’s great, ’cause I have shows in Florida, and I have nowhere to go in between shows.” My mom goes, “You can come over here, but you can’t spend the night on the property.” I said, “Why not?” She goes, “The law at the Villages, Kathleen, is no one under the age of 55 is allowed to spend the night on the property.” I said, “Really? Fifty-five? So you’re telling me at age 48, I’m gonna have to again go get a fake ID– [audience laughing] so that I can spend the night with you freaks. Mom, where would I even go? To, like, a bingo game and roll an old redheaded lady and go, ‘Sorry. I’ll have this back in two days. I just need it to get into the Villages.’” I said, “Mom, how are they gonna know if I’m there? Seriously. Does an old man come in a golf cart and do bed check every night?” She goes, “Yes. That’s what I’ve heard. Yes. That’s what I think happens.” I said, “Well, I’m going to come there and I am gonna spend the night. But I will meet you halfway so you’re not nervous. I’m gonna sleep in my tennis shoes, sports bra and T-shirt and shorts. And if I hear the golf cart, I’m gonna get up, and I’m gonna run into the family room, and I’m gonna hide behind the La-Z-Boy. ’Cause in my own mind, Mom, I’m gonna pretend like I’m in the last scene of The Sound of Music and we’re the Von Trapps on top of the convent hiding behind tombstones… from the Nazis. And then when the golf cart guy shines his flashlight, just for my own amusement, I’m gonna pop out from behind it and go, ‘Don’t do it, Ralph. You’re not one of them. Don’t take us. Come with us.’ And then I’m gonna laugh and laugh. He won’t laugh, but I don’t care. It’s not the ',\n",
              "  'point. I’m gonna laugh. And then I’m gonna run by him, Mom, and I’m gonna run away, and I’m gonna make it over the whole border of the Villages. I’m gonna make it to freedom, and– Do you know how I know I’m confident I can do that? Because I’m the only person out of 350,000 that has both of their real knees, Mom. I am the Usain Bolt of this community. I don’t think you’re respecting my powers.” Prepared to getting older, there’s moments where you’re hanging out with them and you’re like, “Wow. Are you actually going crazy in front of me? Like, should I call someone? I don’t know what to do.” I was in Target with my mom. She opened her wallet and all her credit cards were individually wrapped in tin foil. She unwraps one and hands it to me as if that’s a completely normal exchange of information. I go, “We’re not gonna talk about that?” She goes, “Talk about what, Kathleen?” I go, “The tin foil, Mom. The tin foil.” She goes, “Well, obviously, you have not been keeping up with the news.” I said, “No, I actually thought I had been.” “Well, then you must have missed the story about the raygun people.” “Who are the raygun people?” She said, “Well, your father and I saw it on ‘20-40’ or ‘60-80’ or ‘100 Minutes,’ whatever those serious– It was a very serious program. There are people now, Kathleen, with computer rayguns, and they can shoot that raygun through my purse, through my wallet, and they gather all of your personal information off of that strip on the back of your debit card. They can shoot through your father’s ass at a gas station, right through his ass, into his wallet.” I went, “Okay.” My mom’s not stupid. She was a nurse for a million years. So I called my friend in Boston who’s been a cop forever, and I asked him about the raygun people and told him about the tin foil. He said, “Two things, Kathleen. Number one, no. I have not heard about the raygun people. But in fairness to your mom, I haven’t checked my work e-mail in three days. Now– Number two, and more importantly, what I do know from being a cop for 20 years is that crazy people love tin foil. You don’t need to tell your mother. I’m just telling you so you know that is a fact. An old cop told me that. Always carry tin foil in your squad car. If you come across someone who’s mentally ill and having a psychotic break or maybe someone in a drug frenzy, you just tear off a piece of tin foil, you calmly walk over and go, ‘Make a hat,’ and the whole situation–” They drive to Florida ’cause my mom won’t fly anymore. The fear of flying has literally gone over the edge with her. It started years ago. And I do feel sorry for people who have that fear, ’cause it is real. And you see people at airports. You can always tell. ’Cause their hands, their palms are real sweaty. They’ll talk to anyone. God forbid the time of departure changes. Then they completely unravel. They’re like, “This is it. I think this plane’s br',\n",
              "  'oken, and they’re gonna fly it. Don’t you?” “Yeah, I do. Today is the day. American Airlines is gonna go, ‘Fuck it. Give it a whirl. I don’t care.’ Wha– Every part can’t be that important.” But it’s weird to me that strangers– There will always be a stranger who will say to another stranger, “Oh, you shouldn’t have a fear of flying, because I’ll tell you what, you have a better chance of being in a car crash than you do of being in a plane crash.” And I wanna say, but I won’t ’cause it would be mean, “Yeah, but you have a much better chance of getting in a forgettable car crash than you do of being in a forgettable plane crash.” There’s no way you’re gonna be in a plane crash, go to work on Monday, and then Wednesday look at somebody you work with and go, “Oh, shit, did I forget to tell you? On the way home from Milwaukee, my plane crashed. I don’t know if you saw that on CNN. I was the lady running through the cornfield. My hair had caught on fire because I’m near-sighted and I’d lost my glasses in the turbulence. I actually ran towards the explosion versus away from the explosion. That’s why I called in sick yesterday ’cause… my head hurt ’cause it had been on fire.” I fly every week, and I’ve never even thought about what if something happened to the plane until missing Malaysian Flight 370, which I am admittedly obsessed with. My youngest brother, who I talk to almost every day, has banned me from speaking about it. He goes, “Seriously, Kathleen, if you bring it up, I’m gonna hang up. It’s been almost two years. I don’t wanna hear anything that you’ve read on the Internet. I don’t wanna hear what you and your drunk friends decided happened to it. I–” He goes, “You’ve never been obsessed with a plane crash.” “Ah, ah, ah. What is the problem with that sentence, Pat? You just said ‘plane crash.’ We don’t know if this plane crashed, do we?” That’s– That’s why I’m obsessed with it. About seven months ago, they found a wing of a Triple Seven in the Indian Ocean. That’s what that plane was, a Triple Seven. And they sent that wing to the French. I do not know why the French are in charge of science. I’d have given it to the Germans. But whatever. They actually came out and said, “Well, yeah, um, this definitely is the wing of a Triple Seven, but we cannot confirm it’s missing Malaysian Flight 370.” “Well, has anyone else called… Lost and Found… looking for a wing?” They found another little piece, like, three days ago. But all it says is that– It just says, “Do not step here.” So it could be that or a ladder. Who kno– Nobody– Nobody knows. I watched every minute of the coverage, and my brother goes, “I don’t get it.” I go, “Because it’s the biggest news story of our lifetime, Patrick.” I’m sorry. I’ve assumed my entire life that when we bought a ticket in an airplane to go over a large body of water, I thought the whole time we were up here, someone smarter than us on the ',\n",
              "  'ground at all times knew where the fuck we were. I did. I believed that. Yeah, well, that’s certainly not the case. Cat is out of the bag. They got nothing. Boston to Dublin, Texas, when you get there, man. It gets a little weird after Nova Scotia. They don’t tell people that. As soon as you get a Guinness, give us a holler and let us know everything’s all right. They covered it on CNN for 72 days, and people were complaining it’s too much coverage. I’m like, “No, it’s not. This is wonderful.” ’Cause they have no new information, so now they just have to make up conversation. It got to the point where the experts were, like, building paper airplanes, going, “Okay, here’s what I think happened, all right? It was windy. Come on. Turn on the fan. Stay with me, Bob. Somebody put water in the trash can. That’s my ocean. Come on.” But I watched it, because every day they would go live to the city of Kuala Lumpur to a Hilton hotel for a press conference from the Malaysian Airlines spokesman. I have never felt so sorry for any individual in their job. Because every day he had no new information. And he had to face a ballroom full of Chinese people. ’Cause there were 239 missing people. Most were Chinese. Their families have been flown in. He couldn’t even make eye contact. He would just come out and go, “Brrrr. Ah, ha, yeah. Well, uh, once again, I have new no information on Flight 370. It’s a very bad situation. We cannot find our airplane. We have called Australia. They’re gonna help us look for our airplane. Sometimes you lose something. You can’t find it, and you have to ask for help. ‘Hey, have you seen my keys?’ That’s the kind of situation. Sorry.” Then he would leave. I’m like, “This is a real airline. They’re open. Today. I check every day. I google. This is a real working airline.” And the Chinese people were so kind, I thought. Like in patient. He would come out day after day. There’s nothing. There was very little reaction. Week three he came out. “Ah, brrrr. Ah, yeah, once again, I have no new information on flight. We still cannot find our airplane. It’s a really, really, really bad situation. We do know this now though. We have been looking in the wrong ocean. Ha ha!” What? What? What? What? “Ah, yeah, that ocean wrong. Maybe now over here. We’re gonna look over here in this ocean.” What? The wrong ocean? That is an acceptable statement in the year 1492 regarding a boat. “I don’t know where it went, man. I told you the world was flat. Maybe it just fell off. I don’t know.” That is not an acceptable statement in the year 2014. Unbelievable. And once again, the Chinese people, they just didn’t really react. And I thought, “Oh, my God. That’s– That’s the day where my Irish temper– Every– Every single valve would have burst.” I could’ve had a can of Aqua Net and a lighter, and that man would have burst into a pillar of fire. A biblical pillar of fire on CNN Internat',\n",
              "  'ional. And I would’ve done it knowing full well I’m gonna be arrested and tried for murder, which would’ve been fine. And I would say, “Yes, please let me take the witness stand.” ’Cause I don’t care what question I’m asked. I have a two-word answer. “Miss Madigan, is it true that you took Aqua Net and a lighter into the ballroom?” “Huh. Wrong ocean. Ha!” “Wrong ocean.” Unbelievable. The Chinese people, though, are still pretty kind. Day 72, for those of you who are not obsessed with missing airplanes, um, that’s the last day of hope because the ping device can no longer possibly operate. There’s the black box and then there’s a ping thing that emits a sonar sound. Now, this is assuming one had put batteries in their ping device. Yeah. Google this. About five months ago, they had a little secret announcement ’cause they thought everybody forgot. “Ah, yeah, one more thing. Ha ha. About that airplane. Um, we never had batteries in that. Yeah. Sorry. Well, you know, sometimes at home your remote control, your batteries go dead, and you go to a different remote control, and you take those batteries and you put ’em in this remote control. And then later on, you go for the other old one. You go, ‘Uh-oh. I forgot.’ That’s what happened. Sorry.” They are open. So day 72. At the time the Chinese people don’t know that there’s– They don’t know there’s no batteries. They believe there were batteries in it. He comes out, and I thought, “Whatever you do, just don’t say it the same way. Phrase it differently.” No. No. He came out, “Brrrr. Ah, ha, yeah, once again, I have no new information on Flight 370.” And finally, the Chinese people lost their minds. An old man, like, rolls back, flicked a lit cigarette at that man’s head, live on TV. Sadly, my first thought was, “Wow. You can still smoke inside… in a Hilton in Malaysia.” Note to self: Vacation in Kuala Lumpur. Take different airline. Check Southwest. That airline’s ridiculous. And then the older women started losing it. Like, literally, having heart attacks. 911 is being called. It’s bedlam. They have finally reached their maximum potential of patience. They’re out of it. I happen to be home watching it with my parents. My dad, who does not like public displays of emotion, was like, “Oh, my God. Jesus Christ. They got to get it together. They got to get it together. Do they know they’re on television? Are they aware that people can see?” My mom interrupts with– And I have six siblings. “Well, Jack, you have to understand it’s extra sad for the Chinese people because they only have one child.” I go, “Hold on a second. So are you saying, Mom, it would only be a seventh as sad if I went missing forever?” “Yes, that’s what I’m saying. Yes. You may not wanna hear that, but that’s the truth. I mean, we have six other children. They have children. Your father and I have casino buffet tickets. We are leading a full life.” Yes, you are.',\n",
              "  ' Seven kids. It’s too many. Nobody notices though. That’s a good thing. If you’re one of seven, no one notices anything. Like, I’m surprised– I have friends who have one or two kids. They speak to them about their feelings and their thoughts, and they address them individually. ’Cause my friends are like, “Oh, you guys didn’t?” “No.” No. Not with seven kids. There were just announcements made. That’s all. “We’re moving.” “Oh, fuck. What? What? What? When?” “Your mother’s already in the car. I don’t know what’s going on with you people.” Nobody notices when you’re one of seven. Which was fine with me. I didn’t mind that. I would still choose that. But sometimes to the point of, “Really, guys?” I do not watch myself on TV. I was 35 years old, and I walked into my parents’ house, and they somehow had me on their TV, and I looked at it and I go, “Ah. What is wrong with my eye?” My dad goes, “You mean your lazy one?” “What? What?” “Yeah, your right eye. When you get tired or nervous, it twitches and kind of jumps around. You– You don’t feel that happening?” “No. No, I didn’t know. I didn’t know that was happening. How long has that been going on?” “I mean, since you were a baby. I mean, they, uh… told us to put a patch on you, but you can’t have a baby girl pirate. That’s crazy. So, uh… we thought you’d grow out of it, quite frankly, and clearly you have not, Kathleen. So if I were you, before you go on television, I would get a nap or calm down, ’cause it’s–” I didn’t really know how small families worked till I got to go over to other friends’ houses. When you’re in second grade or whatever, my friend across the street, Bob, he would say, “That’s my mom and that’s my sister.” And I’m like, “Well, where is everyone?” Like, I don’t wanna say anything. Maybe there was a house fire or, you know, some sort of tragedy. But this is weird. I think smaller families are kinder. They say kinder things. I don’t know if they mean them, but I heard “I love you” a lot. “I love you.” “love you too.” “Love you more than yesterday.” “Ha! Love you more than tomorrow.” And it’s not even today. I would just stand there paralyzed and uncomfortable. “You guys don’t say ‘I love you’?” “No.” There are nine people in my house. Saying “I love you” would be a sign of weakness. They need to wake up and wonder how I feel about their ass. I’m not giving them that. And at this age if I walked into a room and all my siblings were sitting there and they started to say “I love you,” I’d run out because I would know this is some sort of intervention, and I’m not falling for that. I’m not listening to your dumb-ass sad letter. “Dear Kathleen.” We went to Catholic schools. Uh, yeah, I didn’t mind. [man] Whoo! If I had kids, I would make them go to a Catholic school, ’cause I’ll tell you, the one thing I guarantee you, if you send your kids to a Catholic school, they will never join ISIS. Somebody would’ve sai',\n",
              "  'd to me at age 18 after all that Catholicism, “Hey, could we talk to you about our religion for a minute?” Ha ha ha ha ha ha! “No, you may not. You are 18 years late to this party, Muhammad. You–” [Kathleen chuckling] I think being Catholic is Christian, but it’s been pointed out to me many times in the South that they’re not the same. ’Cause in the South, they’ll go, “Oh, are you Christian?” I’ll go, “Yeah, I’m Catholic.” “Oh, well, we’re Christian.” “Oh, okay. I thought we said the same thing, but I guess not.” There are differences. The Christians have a direct relationship with Jesus. They speak of it like that. “You know what? Me and my relationship with Jesus. I love Jesus. Jesus loves me.” It’s a direct, very solid relationship with Jesus. And I thought, “Wow. Really? You guys go straight to Jesus.” In a Catholic school, I was given a laundry list of people to contact… before, the nuns said, because otherwise I’m bothering Jesus. “You are gonna call these people, Kathleen, before you bother Jesus. You could start with your guardian angel. He’s got nothing to do 24 hours a day except tend to your needs. If he’s not available, you can speak to the saint in charge of the activity you’re upset about. Every single saint has been assigned an assignment. You can speak to Jesus’ mother if you’d like to. You can give Mary a shout. But you are not to bother Jesus.” Okeydokey. Even if I did something bad, I couldn’t tell Jesus. I had to go to confession. I had to get in a creepy closet with a guy in the dark. And then I had to tell him, and he’s gonna tell a guy. And I wasn’t good at confession because my dad, for many years, was a defense attorney. And starting in second grade, he would tell us all at the dinner table, “I want all of you kids to remember if the police capture you or anyone in a position of authority ask you questions, your response, no matter what, are ‘I do not recall, I need an attorney. I do not recall, I need an attorney.’ Ninety percent of people are in prison because they can’t keep their goddamn mouths shut. Never, ever snitch on yourself.” And then I would go to confession in the closet, and the priest would go, “Kathleen, have you done anything bad? Is there anything you’d like to tell me about?” [Kathleen chuckles] I’m not falling for this. My dad’s probably planted him here. I know– I know what I’m supposed to say. “I’m sorry, Father, but I do not recall and I need an attorney.” “Honey, you’re only in second grade.” “Well, maybe you don’t know this, Father Anthony, but 90% of people are in prison because they can’t keep their goddamn mouths shut. If you’d like some more information on that–” If you’re from a big family, you know you never say anything directly to the sibling that you intend on saying something till you say it to a different sibling. They’ll say it to another, and then eventually it’ll get back to the sibling you intended it to ',\n",
              "  'say. I, uh– This year at Christmas, my brother said, “You should be on time because last year you were late.” And he said that our other sister said I ruined Christmas. I go, “Really? Did she say that? I ruined it? I’m calling her.” I go, “Did you say I ruined Christmas?” [scoffs] “Well, I might’ve. I mean, you were late. Everybody knew to get there at 9:30. You didn’t get there until 10:00. The kids were all excited. Everyone was excited. We had to wait ’cause you had to stop–” I go, “Okay, I agree. I was late. I apologize for that. But I would like to point out for the future that I think you and I have very different definitions of what ruining Christmas would be.” To me, ruining Christmas would be if I would’ve walked into Mom and Dad’s house with a 12-gauge shotgun and shot them in the face. I think that ruins Christmas. It ruins the rest of the Christmases after that, ’cause you can’t ever have another Christmas without going, “Oh, my God. Remember that one Christmas when Kathleen went crazy and shot Mom and Dad in the face? It was horrible.” My siblings have tons of kids. They’re everywhere. I don’t have any, and I’m glad I don’t. I don’t have the pressure of naming the kids. That’s awful. My youngest brother, his name is John Patrick Madigan. That’s my dad’s name, and that name has been in our family since 1853, circa Ireland, as far as we can count back. And then my youngest brother knew that they were having a boy, and he called and said, “You know what? I’m not gonna do it.” I go, “You’re not gonna name him John Patrick Madigan?” He goes, “No.” I go, “Well, I’ve never asked you for anything, but I would like to know when and where you’re going to be telling Dad this information, because I’m gonna bring a cooler of beer ’cause that’s how long his answer’s gonna be, Pat, and it’s gonna involve the whole history of Ireland and what’s wrong with English people and they were actually potatoes, but they never gave ’em to the people and Henry VIII. Wha– Why– Why would you pick this fight? Your name is John Patrick Madigan. We call you Patrick. His is John Patrick Madigan. We call him Jack. Grandpa was John Patrick Madigan. We call him– You can call him Fuck Nut. Just name him. This is a crazy fight, in my mind. Don’t– You’d have a better time telling Dad you’re gonna become a woman. Seriously. ’Cause Mom would smooth it over ’cause you’re the baby. Everyone in LA’s doing it. Bruce Jenner. Cher’s son.” I said, “Why? Why, Patrick? Why?” He goes, “You don’t know what it’s like to live with somebody else’s name. Exact same name.” He goes, “You know, I cannot get Direct TV because Dad won’t pay their bill.” What? I go, “They don’t even have Direct TV.” “Oh, no, not anymore. They did. Four years ago.” That’s how long the standoff’s been going on. It’s over a movie that Dad claims he didn’t rent. They’ve paid everything but that charge, but that charge has penalties. So i',\n",
              "  't’s now $287. And I said, “Well, just pay the bill. I’ll pay it.” He goes, “No, I could pay it too. But I can’t pay it ’cause he won’t give me the account information. Because he doesn’t wanna pay it.” I go, “What was the movie, just out of curiosity?” He goes, “Lincoln, starring Daniel Day-Lewis. And if you like to hear that speech, call him, Kathleen.” “Why would I rent Abraham Lincoln? Has something new happened? Do we have new information? Did John Wilkes Booth not shoot Abraham Lincoln? I never ordered goddamn Lincoln . I know it.” I said, “All right. Well, if you’re not gonna do that, what other names were you guys thinking of?” He goes, “Well, a lot. But here’s a little left-field one. Maybe Seamus.” And I went, “Seamus Madigan?” He goes, “Why is that funny to you?” I go, “I don’t know. But we should pay attention to that.” I just laughed for no reason. I go, “I think names have power. If you’re gonna name him Seamus Madigan, I think you should lower all expectations.” Seamus Madigan is a bartender. He always was a bartender. He will always be a bartender. I don’t think he’s gonna be a heart surgeon. And if he was, I wouldn’t let him operate on me, even if he was my nephew. If I was in some emergency room, they came out and said, “Your surgeon, Dr. Seamus Madigan, will be out in a minute,” I would be like, “No, he will not.” And I would wheel my ass down to the Jewish hospital, where there was a nice young man named Sam whose family took education more seriously than beer pong and football. That’s what I would do. I have no kids. I don’t– I don’t want them. I’ve seen what it’s done to some of my siblings. Oh, they’re so tired and cranky. My sister’s normally very happy. Has twins. She looks so tired. I go, “You look really tired.” “You don’t have to say that. I know I look tired. I am tired. I have four-year-olds. Did you know– I thought it was gonna get easier. It doesn’t. The average four-year-old asks 436 questions in a day. Did you know that? And I have two of ’em. And I’m too tired to add 436 plus 436. It’s a lot of questions, Kathleen.” I said, “Do you know why they ask 436? ’Cause you were dumb enough to answer the first question. That’s what led to that line of questioning. You got to shut it down.” If I have ’em, I’d throw ’em in the van in the morning. They’ll ask a random question. “Hey, Aunt Kat, how come their dog gets to be out front and ours doesn’t?” “Fuck if I know.” That’s the answer. Ask Siri. Siri has answers. Aunt Kat, no answers. [Kathleen chuckles] Here’s the biggest reason I would never wanna have a kid. ’Cause I will never again on my own or even assist on installing a car seat. I don’t know how many of you ever had to do this, but if you’re gonna, here’s a few helpful hints. Take the whole day off work, because that’s how long it’s gonna take you. Whatever your favorite alcohol is, have a bucket of it next to that minivan, ’cause you’re',\n",
              "  ' gonna stop and have to take drinks and re-read things. If you’re over the age of, oh, I’d say 30, at some point you’re going to become infuriated with Ralph Nader, ’cause he’s the one who started it all. I remember being in grade school and he was on 60 Minutes . “Seat belts. Everybody must have a seat belt. Car seat, seat belts, safety is for life. Head injuries are also for life. I have statistics.” Well, maybe you do, Ralph. I’m sure you do. But so do I. There were seven of us, Ralph. For 16 years, we rode around in the back of a station wagon completely untethered. Completely. And we were in accidents. A lot of them. Especially if my mom was driving. We– Sometimes we got hit so hard, I actually flew to a better seat than I’d originally secured. “Who’s got the window now, jackass?” That’s right. And that was with my parents chain-smoking in the car. Both of ’em. It was so smoky in that car. You could barely see other passengers. Seriously. They way, way back was like Studio 54, because the sun would hit the smoke and create patterns, and then I would draw patterns within the pattern because I didn’t have an iPad, so that’s what I would do to entertain myself. If you’re a woman and you’re gonna install a car seat, I would highly suggest you put on a sports bra, ’cause you’re gonna get hot. You’re gonna be so hot, you’re gonna start inadvertently just tearing off pieces of clothing. And if you’re not careful, you’ll end up like I did, in my sister’s driveway in my regular bra just drinking a beer, staring off into space. And the normally, very friendly neighbors came home. I’m trying to talk to ’em. I don’t know why they’re being so weird. And I’m like, “How you guys doing? Yeah, I know. I just came home. She had twins. I need two of these. I can’t– can’t figure it out. I’m so hot. I’m so hot. I would offer you a beer, but I only have three left. And I’ve made no progress.” So– I just found notes on the back– There’s factory notes that say if you don’t know how to do this, you can take it to the police or the fire department and they’ll install it for you. But unfortunately, I didn’t find those notes till after I already started drinking. So I don’t think it would be a good idea to drive to law enforcement, shit-faced, and two car seats and I don’t have any babies. I mean, It’s just too much to explain, right? Crazy. So this was what I was thinking. I was thinking I might set her car on fire. No, call the fire department, and then after they put the car out, I go, “Hey, since you’re all here, do you think you can give me a hook-up?” [man] Yeah! [chuckles] They’re a pain in the ass, to put kids in them, especially in winter with the coats and 70,000 buckles and the whole thing. And my brother’s kid I thought was big enough to not go in a car seat, and I said, “Do I do him too?” She’s just disgusted with my lack of any parenting knowledge. She goes, “Ugh. 4-foot-10, 80',\n",
              "  ' pounds.” What? “That’s a Missouri state law, Kathleen. If you’re 4-foot-10 or shorter, 80 pounds or less, your ass is in a car seat versus a ticket from the Missouri State Highway Patrol.” I go, “Really, 4’10”? That is excellent news because right now I’m only 5-foot-1. The average woman, due to osteoporosis… in your life, you would have shrunk anywhere from two to five inches. I am not certain. I am bad at math. But I’m pretty sure that puts me back in a car seat. I can’t wait to be back in a car seat. All these nieces and nephews I have will be old enough to drive. I’m gonna do exactly what they do. I’ll call and say I need a ride. Then I’m gonna pack a big bag full of unnecessary, unrelated items that I have to have, or there is going to be a meltdown. Then, like the five and six-year-olds, I’m gonna get in the van and walk, on my own accord, to the very backseat, and I’m just gonna hop up in it like they do and wait for the great buckling. Just sit there. [mouthing words] Then I’m gonna let ’em buckle me in. Then I’m gonna let them pull away. And I’m gonna wait till they drive where it’s somewhere terribly inconvenient to pull over. And I’m gonna start screaming from the back like they do. “My buckle’s too tight!” [gasping] “I’m choking!” [gasping] [chuckles] “I dropped my wine.” [gasping] “I can’t reach my wine.” [chuckling] That’s what I want to do when I’m retired. I just want to drink red wine and watch House Hunters over and over. I love that show. I do. I don’t know why. I don’t even care what houses these people are buying. I’m more interested in their relationships because at least 50 percent of the people shouldn’t even be married, more or less purchasing property together. I saw one in Atlanta. It was a man and a woman. They walked into the house. And the first thing out of the man’s mouth, he goes, “Ah! I can’t live with this backsplash.” Oh, my God, ma’am. You have a much bigger problem than what house you’re gonna buy. You have accidentally married a gay guy. And his boyfriend is not gonna approve of this ugly backsplash when he comes over here while you’re at yoga, aka drinking with your girlfriends on a Thursday. I’m just amazed to, like– In my whole life I’ve never punched anybody, but if I was the Realtors on this show, I would punch at least half of these people– my own clients right in the face. They are so demanding, and they naysay a house right out of the gate. They just walk in and go, “Pah! I can’t live here. There’s no granite countertops.” I’m sorry. Maybe you forgot. You have a budget of $8.00. Maybe… you should be grateful that I’m not showing you a mobile home right now and bragging about the porch that JoJo put on before he went back to prison. What in Christ’s name would make you think you can have granite countertops? And it’s always the meanest lady of any episode who at some point would go, “I don’t know if I want to live here. I ',\n",
              "  'don’t see any room for entertaining.” Well, don’t worry, ma’am. No one’s fucking coming over here. You’re the meanest person I’ve ever heard speak English on television. Seriously. But I think over the age of 40, if that’s what I wanna do with my time– Over 40 you can kind of give up. If I just want to drink wine, why not? The dream catcher didn’t catch anything. It’s the third quarter. I’m losing. Just– I do understand– Over 40– I don’t understand young people that kind of give up so early where you can tell they’re just disgusted. They don’t want any more information. They have just had it. Early, like in their 20s. I flew to Norfolk, Virginia. I’ve never been there. I got off the plane. And their airport was themed. I’ve never seen that. And the theme they chose was mermaids. They were everywhere. They were, like, in the carpet, in baggage claim. They’re handing you the luggage. They’re just everywhere. And I went to the gift shop on the way out because I wanted to get water. There’s a girl working in the gift shop. She’s about 25 years old. I said, “Hey, I’m not from here. What’s going on with all this mermaid stuff?” And she said, and I quote, [raspy voice] “I don’t know. Somebody saw one once.” Wow. Wow. I thought, she truly doesn’t give a shit. She– Bigfoot could’ve been shopping in that gift shop. She’d be like, “I don’t know what your hairy ass is planning on buying, but I close in five minutes, all right? I ain’t scared of you, Mr. Monster Man.” “I don’t know. Somebody saw one once.” Just so disgusted that I even asked. But then after meeting the mermaid lady, for, like, the next three months no matter what question I was asked, that’s the only answer I would give. I’ll just go, “I don’t know. Somebody saw one once.” Because it is so confusing and dismissive to the recipient, but it’s so fun if you’re the one saying it. My– My youngest brother, the one who won’t let me speak about Malaysian Flight 370, he helps me with my taxes ’cause if I– Any state you work in you have to fill out their forms even if you don’t get money back. He called about six weeks after I’ve met the mermaid lady, and he goes, “Yeah, Kathleen, I’m trying to do your taxes. I’m trying to get all these states. I think you worked in Wisconsin two times. You should get– They have a state-withholding tax. You’ll be able to get a refund. It’s a 3.8 percent. Ah, da, da. When you got paid, you should’ve been given some forms. Do you know where those forms are?” “I don’t know. Somebody saw one once.” And I guarantee you, if you say that, the only thing a person will ever say back is, “What?” And then– [mouthing words] That’s what I wanna do. I wanna drink red wine and watch House Hunters . Uh, I don’t usually think I drink too much until you go to the doctor and they have those drinking questions on there. Yeah. Mine, it’s seven and eight. Question 7: Do you drink alcohol? A little tiny box says, ',\n",
              "  '“Yes.” Question 8: Do you drink two, four, six or eight drinks a week? “No.” [laughs] No. You are not even in the right ballpark. Jesus Christ. What is this, a Mormon practice? I thought the name said “Fitzgerald.” And I would not be judged on my deviant and abhorring drinking behavior. See other side, parenthesis, arrow. No. If I do feel bad about my drinking, I would come here. ’Cause you guys set a whole new bar. [audience cheering] Uh, or I go to Ireland. I try to go once a year to be with my people. To reset my priorities and my boundaries. I have friends that go to Hawaii every year. They’re like, “We love Hawaii, but you seem to really love Ireland. Do you think we would like it? Do you think they’re similar?” Oh. [scoffs] Well, they’re both an island. Um, Ireland, however, would have no vegetables or sun. I don’t know if those two things interest you, but they are fresh out. It is not a healthy place. That’s why I feel at home there, and that’s why I like it there. It’s sort of the gist. They just don’t really, truly give a shit. On a good level, in a healthy way, they’ve decided to not be healthy. I was in a pub. I ordered roast beef with mashed potatoes, ’cause I love that, and I thought, I’m going to ask, probably the answer is no, but I– The guy was like 80, the bartender. And I go, “Hey, do you guys, by any chance, have any corn?” You would’ve thought I asked for an eight-ball of cocaine. I– He goes, “Corn?” [Irish accent] “No, we wouldn’t have any corn here in the countryside. We probably don’t have any corn in the entire country at the moment.” I said, “Have you ever had corn?” “Yes. I’ve had corn. When I was nine, we traveled to Germany. And I had some corn and I didn’t care for it.” I was like, “Good for you.” He hasn’t had corn in 71 years. And he doesn’t give a shit. And he looks fine. And he’s bartending on a Thursday. The whole pace of Ireland is just slower. But I like it better. It just takes you a while in your American mind to slow down like that. I went– ’Cause they don’t– It’s very– Nobody’s really, you know, fired up on it. I went in a store that said “bagels,” in a little town in the country. I walked in. There’s a lady. And there’s a glass case, and there’s no bagels. And I thought, here we go. Right? I go, “You don’t have any–” I thought maybe they were in the back. “You don’t have any bagels?” “No, I’m afraid we wouldn’t have any bagels at the moment.” “Are you selling any other food right now?” “No. I wouldn’t be selling anything but the bagels, and I don’t have at the moment.” It’s at that point your American brain wants to go, “What the fuck is wrong with you people?” But I would never do that ’cause I’m Midwest polite. I– I said, “Uh, what– Can I ask you a question? Why are you still open? ’Cause you have nothing for sale.” She goes, “I left the door open. First of all, I don’t know where the bagels are. They’re supposed to be here h',\n",
              "  'alf past 7:00. It’s half past 10:00. I don’t know. Perhaps there’s been an accident on the road. You’ll say a rosary or perhaps a novena tonight for Johnny the bagel man. I left the door open in case I had a nice conversation with someone like yourself.” Oh, my God. I have to now go back to the other bar and order a Guinness in order to fix this conversation in my brain. I love Guinness. That is actually my favorite thing in the whole world. It’s the greatest drink. It’s like somebody had a beer, and then somebody threw a roast beef in the beer, and then somebody put mashed potatoes on top and handed it to you. [man] Whoo! It’s not healthy. But I really don’t care about health either. There comes a point in your life where you’re like, “I think it’s too late.” That’s why I don’t like to watch CNN because Sanjay Gupta, that doctor, comes on, and he is a buzzkill. Every single time he’s on, he’s got bad news about things that can kill us. But it’s things we’ve been doing our whole lives. I’m like, “Sanjay, people watching CNN are most likely over the age of 30. It is too late for us. You, sir, should be on Nickelodeon. Tell the children. Save the children.” It’s too late. I was watching it about two weeks before Thanksgiving. He came on. He’s like, “Uh-oh. Oh, God. Horrible news. Uh, World Health Organization just did a study. And as it turns out, they have decided that processed meats are raising the cancer rates by a much higher rate, specifically bacon.” [audience jeering] Yeah. Yeah, well, that’s right, Wisconsin. That’s– [chuckles] Whoa. I’m like, bacon? I’m sorry to hear that, Sanjay. ’Cause I love bacon. I’ve been eating it my whole life. Sometimes I put it in Bloody Marys. I’ve actually drank bacon. That’s how much– I added it up. In my life, give or take ten, I have eaten 311 pigs. I– I’ve eaten a farm, sir. You can’t fix that with a yoga class. You can’t back that damage up with a walk around the block. And I don’t even go looking for health stuff. I’m not that person where– No. Like the front page of Yahoo. I don’t know. Six months ago it said, “If you’re fair skin with freckles, uh, click here.” Why, I don’t want to click it. You know it’s not good news. They’re not gonna go, “Hey, guess what, freckle people. Y’all won $50. Run on down to the post office and pick up your government check.” No. But I feel like I have to click on it, ’cause it’s a meeting of my people. What if there’s an announcement and I don’t hear it, and I’m the only lady that didn’t know. Look like some sort of jackass. So I clicked on it. Google this. It’s unbelievable. They go, “Uh-oh. Pah, just found this out.” Incoming. Breaking news. If you’re white with freckles, fair skin, and you’ve been drinking orange juice– All of us, our whole lives– or eating grapefruit, they have figured out that when you go outside in the sun, because your skin– It’s so easy to penetrate your skin, that the ',\n",
              "  'sun is activating the acid from the grapefruits and the oranges, raising your chances of melanoma by, like, 27 percent. Yeah. So now, I can’t go outside to exercise in the sunshine. Or I will become activated which forces me back into the dark bar… where I can have a Bloody Mary with some bacon in it. [applause] [man] yeah! And I said to my sister, “I would– I would exercise more. But all I do is fly around. I’m just sitting in an airport.” She goes, “You should get a Fitbit.” This is what this is on my arm. It would work better if I charged it properly. But this counts your steps and your miles. And it’ll have your heart rate if you want to enter your food. It’s like this– I go, “Well, maybe I’ll do that. Maybe I’ll get addicted to seeing how many steps I get in a day.” So, from my iPad, on my couch, I ordered the Fitbit from Amazon. I paid the extra money to have it overnighted. So the following day, this was on my porch on my front steps, which I now know is six and a half steps away from my couch. And then I opened it up, and I googled it, ’cause I wanted to know how it work. Really? It can count how far I’ve walked, steps and speed. We can’t find Flight 370, but I’m not supposed to talk about that. Supposed to just let that go. But we have this technology. So I googled, “How does it work?” It works based on this motion from when you’re walking. And then, my Irish jackasses kicked in and I thought, but does it know if my whole body is moving? What if I had a glass of wine and I was going like that? Would it know? The answer is no. It does not know. I drank two and a half miles while watching the last– [applause] Thank you. Two and a half miles while watching the last Republican debate. I know I won’t vote for any politician who says this, uh, at anytime. If they say it. So far four of them have said it. It’s like a hack line they say on the campaign trail. I just find it so cheesy. They’ll go, “People, America is a place where your dreams can come true. I’m here to make your dreams come true. Wouldn’t you like your dreams to come true?” I’m sitting there thinking, “No. No, I don’t.” And the fact that you said that makes me certain you have never drank a box of wine and taken an Ambien. I do not want my dreams to come true. It was horrifying. I did it like six weeks ago. Here was the dream. This is the whole dream. I’m in Alaska, wearing a sombrero. It’s raining Cheetos, but I can’t move my arms. [groaning] Three and a half hours of that. No thanks. And then I turned on late-night TV, and that’s all the infomercials. And there it was, the Sarah McLachlan sad animal commercial. [audience groans] Exactly. I feel the same way. But I’ve seen it like 200 times. And do you know what I’ve done? Honestly? Nothing. And that’s not nice. But that’s the truth. I thought, why don’t I react to this? I can’t get an animal. I’m gone too much, but I could send the money. I think the',\n",
              "  'y say like 62 cents a day for the dog or the cat, right? But then I thought, “Well, I don’t know what’s going on there, Sarah, but that kid on the other channel is only 55 cents a day. So maybe your cat’s living a little large, Sarah. Or maybe the child needs a raise. I don’t know, but someone should check that before you start throwing figures like that out at night, late night when all the infomercials are on in a row.” And I thought, this ad doesn’t work on me because it’s so sad, I usually turn it off. Like, you can’t motivate people to action through the emotion of sadness. You need to make people angry or shocked or appalled. That’s what gets people of their ass. You don’t ever see a protest with a bunch of people just laying around crying. No. That’s not going to happen. And I thought, they need to redo this commercial to make a lot more money for the animals. I– This is what I’m doing late night after my Ambien and boxed wine. I’m thinking of how to fix the commercial. And I– I would call Sarah back. She seems like a lovely lady. Call her up in Canada and go, “We really messed up. We need you back down here, and we’re going to reshoot the commercial.” You pay for her to come back to America. You go, “Here’s what’s gonna– Here’s how it’s going to work, Sarah. We’re going to send you out to that song that you wrote, the saddest song ever written on earth.” ♪ In the arms ♪ [yowling] I don’t know what the words are. I think it’s about that cat having pink eye, but I can’t– I don’t know. That one definitely has pink eye. It’s dangerous ’cause it’s gonna hop to the other eye like Bob Costas at the Olympics. It’s– It’s a mess. You got to put hot water on it. And cats don’t like water. I don’t know how you would begin to fix that. But here’s what’s gonna happen, Sarah. You’re gonna walk out to that song that you wrote. Lovely song. And in one hand, you’re going to be holding a beagle puppy. And in the other hand, you’re going to be holding a pistol. Remember, this is for the animals. Stay with me. And then I’m going to need you, Sarah, to say in your oh-so-angelic voice, without laughing– You have to be serious. She’ll go, “Hello. I’m Sarah McLachlan. If someone doesn’t come down here… in the next 45 minutes, I’m gonna blow this beagle’s brains out.” I would be horrified. I’d be like, “Can you Shazam her location? Where is she?” And I would drive down there, and I would take the puppy and kick the gun out of her hand. And where did you even get a gun? You’re Canadian. You’re allowed one bear gun per family, Sarah. That is not a bear gun. You guys have been a lot of fun. If you drank and you’re gonna drive, focus. Don’t be playing with your phone. I am not advocating drinking and driving. I’m not. Drinking and driving is really bad. And it’s really bad– I never thought about this. But I have a friend, who told me to say was a very handsome friend, Rick in Denver, he got',\n",

And they lock it all in a drawer. Then they come back to your cell and tell you you’re now allowed to make one phone call. [blows air] Well, that’s the problem. ’Cause you just locked my brain in a drawer. I don’t know anybody’s phone numbers by heart anymore. Seriously, I don’t. I don’t know what I– What– What would you do? I know the number of the house I grew up in. I could call that family… and hope that they were really nice people. “Don’t hang up. Don’t hang up. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. I’m in so much trouble. I know you guys are kind of busy in Ferguson. Do you have $2,800?” Then I thought, seriously? They wouldn’t let you look at your phone? He goes, “Kathleen, you don’t get it. No, no.” I go, “I think that’s being stringent. You’re not a murderer. You’re not a rapist. You’re Drunky the Clown. You’ve been captured. You can’t hurt anybody. They wouldn’t even show you your contacts?” “No.” I thought, especially if I had been drinking, that’s when my jackass behavior would kick in. And I would say, “Okay, I’m ready for my call.” I let them bring me the phone, and my one call, I would call 911 from the cell. [chuckling] “Hello. Oh, yes, this is absolutely an emergency.” [blows air] “Well, I have been kidnapped. That’s what’s going on here. I was abducted by two men in matching outfits. And I was thrown into what I can only surmise right now is some sort of sex dungeon.” [chuckling] “No, I’m not laughing. No, I’m not laughing. My location? Well, that actually is kind of funny. If– If you would just glance down the hall. Ha ha!” All right, you guys, thank you so much. I’ve had a great time. Thank you for coming out. We appreciate it. Lew too. Thank you. Good night.

              " ['Kevin James: Irregardless (2024) In Kevin James: Irregardless, a 2024 stand-up comedy special, Kevin James delivers a performance that expertly blends humor with insightful observations on everyday life. He begins with a quirky musical number, showcasing his singing talent and setting a lighthearted tone. Throughout the special, James touches on a variety of relatable topics, often with a self-deprecating twist. One central theme is the absurdity and humor found in aging and health. James jokes about his own physical decline and the overmedicalization of modern life, like being labeled “prediabetic” and the unnecessary fear this instills. He also satirizes societal overcaution with a story about a woman labeled “borderline anemic,” highlighting the tendency to exaggerate health concerns. James humorously addresses technology and its intrusiveness, particularly through his mistrust of Siri and the difficulty of deleting apps. His take on modern parenting and child-rearing resonates with many, as he discusses removing video games from his children and the challenges of engaging them in physical activities. This segues into a broader critique of contemporary parenting styles, contrasting them with the stricter, belt-driven discipline of previous generations. In a poignant turn, James reflects on his own limitations in knowledge and conversation, using the story of Buster Douglas to illustrate his narrow expertise. He humorously recounts an awkward social encounter where his lack of knowledge is exposed, leading to a comedic breakdown of his attempt to use complex vocabulary. In his routine, James humorously focuses on the dynamics of his marriage, particularly highlighting the contrast between his wife’s incessant talking and his own introspective nature. He examines their differing communication styles with a blend of admiration and playful frustration. The special concludes with a return to the musical theme, bookending the performance and leaving the audience with a feeling of entertainment mixed with thoughtful reflection on the absurdities of modern life. * * *  ♪ I’ve been having dreams About falling in love ♪ [audience cheering and whistling] ♪ It feels so real ♪ ♪ But nobody is here when I wake up ♪ ♪ Do you know my name ♪ ♪ The devil’s in the detail ♪ ♪ I’m a natural born killer ♪ [audience continues cheering] ♪ I’m a natural born ♪ ♪ Take this hopeless broken soul ♪ ♪ Of this remote control ♪ ♪ Plot twist ♪ ♪ A whole generation lost With no promise ♪ ♪ Can you feel my love ♪ ♪ Do you know my pain ♪ ♪ It’s in my head every night on replay ♪ ♪ A deadly game ♪ ♪ For a natural born killer ♪ ♪ I’m a natural born killer ♪ ♪ Natural ',\n",

[audience laughing] I never go that long. That was little longer than I expected. I got a little excited. We’re gonna bring it down. ‘Cause everything hurts. Everything hurts. Last week I woke up, I asked my wife, “Hey.” “Did I play rugby yesterday?” [audience laughing] She’s like, “No, you shook a can of paint for me.” [audience laughing] She was right. This is all I did. This was it. Because it was outside of my every day body movements, I don’t do this. I felt it the day after. I’m gonna feel this tomorrow ’cause I just did this for you guys right now. It wasn’t even a big can. I’m talking the little Häagen-Dazs size. [audience laughing] Body’s falling apart. Falling apart. It’s horrible. When to the doctor to get checked out. He said, “Everything’s really good. I do wanna let you know that you are prediabetic.” I was like, “Hmm, all right?” [scoffs] Who isn’t, right? I mean, come on. [audience laughing] Why would you even tell me that? Do I have diabetes? He goes, “No.” [audience laughing] But I could get diabetes? He goes, “Yes.” Okay. Do you have diabetes? [audience laughing] He goes, “No.” I go, “But could you get diabetes?” [audience laughing] He said, “I guess so.” I go, “Let me tell you something, you’re prediabetic.” [audience laughing and clapping] No charge. That’s on the house. Are you alive? Yeah. You’re also pre-dead. Sorry about that. We’re all gonna die. Pre… Prediabetes. If I have diabetes, tell me. I’ll change the way I eat. What’s with the “pre”? That’s how this world operates. “Pre.” Fear. You might. Almost, you don’t know. Scan. Check. Pre-scan. What? Huh? Yeah. Everything’s fear. Did you hear about Julie? No, what’s the matter with Julie? She’s borderline anemic. [audience laughing] Julie has anemia? No. She’s borderline. She’s close. [audience laughing] So Julie’s anemic? No, she’s not anemic at all. Here’s the line if you would have anemia, you would be on this side of the line. And if you don’t have anemia, you’re on this side with everybody else. Julie is on this side with everybody else. She’s just slightly ahead of us all, closer to the line where she would have it if she did. But she doesn’t. She’s closer. She’s like in the whoa, you better watch out soon area, like maybe. [audience laughing] So, what do you want me to do? There’s nothing you can do. She doesn’t have it. [audience laughing] Then why are you telling me? I just thought you might want a little more anxiety added onto your plate with everything else that’s going on the world. [audience laug',\n",
              "  'hing] You know, just think about Julie, right? Prayers for Julie, you know what I’m saying? I mean, how does she do it? How does she wake up every day? To face another sunrise, trudging through the day, knowing that she almost has something that she doesn’t even have. [audience laughing] She’s so close to almost having something that, even if she did, it would be that bad. ‘Cause… She could clear it up with some red meat and a little B12. [audience laughing] She, she almost has it, man. [audience clapping] She’s there. She’s in trenches with this. She has two kids. What does she tell them? How do they grow up knowing that they have a mother that’s gonna be fine? [audience laughing] Everything is fear. It’s pre-fear. Fear. You don’t know. Fear. We have nothing to be afraid of. We have nothing to be afraid of. We really don’t. We… Yeah. Yes. [audience whoops] Nothing. We live in the safest times in all of human history. We have nothing to fear. We are so blessed. We are… You know who had something to be afraid of? Men fighting in the Revolutionary War. How about them? Or the Civil War, right? That’s fear. Right? Brother against brother. Across an open field. Chance of survival is minimal. And you’re the guy carrying the flag. [audience laughing] That’s fear. They’re handing out muskets… [audience laughing] …and you get the flag. [audience laughing] Yeah, I’d like a musket, please. Uh, sorry, we’re all out. I can give you the flag. [audience laughing] What do I do with that? Well, you see those line of guys over there, with muskets, across that field? You stand in front of them. You get right in front of them. And you give it a little of this. You just got… [audience laughing] You want me to raise our symbol, show the enemy exactly where to aim? That’s what they did. They didn’t care. They had courage back then. Out in front. Do it. Let’s do it. Get it up there. Yes! Waving that flag. Be aggressive. B-E aggressive. B-E-A-G-R-G-I-G-F-E Aggressive! They didn’t care. [soft popping sounds] [audience laughing] [soft popping sounds] [soft popping sound] Aggressive. [soft popping sound] [soft popping sounds, grunting] I’d be waving that thing so low profile… [audience laughing] They’d be like, “Get that flag up! Let them know who we are!” [audience laughing] [audience cheering and clapping] I’d be like, “I don’t want the flag. Do you have a bayonet?” “No, I got a snare drum and drum sticks. You want that?” That’s even worse. [imitates drum roll] Fire that thing up! Let them know we’re coming! [imitates drum roll] [audience laughing] Play that thing! I’m playing it, I’m playing it. I’d take out the brushes if I could, right? [imitates brushing ',\n",
              "  'a drum] [audience laughing] We have nothing to be afraid of. We, we find things to be afraid of. We do. Food companies know we’re afraid. They know it. That’s why they’re trying to make all their food sound healthy. They market it that way. Have a box of Cheerios. My Cheerios says “may lower cholesterol” on the box. Cheerios may lower cholesterol. You know what I know about Cheerios when it says “may lower cholesterol” on the box? I know that Cheerios doesn’t lower cholesterol. [audience laughing] ‘Cause if it did, it would say “Cheerios lowers cholesterol”, but it says “may.” It says “may.” So they, either, honestly, they don’t know, or they had the laziest scientists in the history of the world working down at the Cheerio factory. Where they just come in every day, “Hey, Wendell, how’s it going? Just checking to see where we stand with the whole cholesterol thing.” Can we put that Cheerios lowers cholesterol on the box? Yeah, I wouldn’t. Yeah. I would just stick with “may.” [audience laughing] Just go with “may.” You haven’t figured it out? No, we’re trying to. We’re plugging away, but there’s a lot of stuff going on. I got a phone call earlier. I gotta take my daughter to soccer. There’s things getting involved here, you know. Just go with “may.” Put “may.” “May lower cholesterol.” They’re not gonna know. Put “may.” They’ll think it lowers. You don’t know. I don’t even know. So how are they gonna know? You don’t know that it couldn’t, right? Put that. Cheerios, you don’t know that it couldn’t lower cholesterol. [audience laughing] Put “definitely should lower cholesterol, Cheerios.” [audience laughing] I don’t trust anybody. I don’t trust the food companies. I don’t trust my phone. I don’t trust Siri. Do you trust Siri? Let me tell you, Siri is listening to you every second of the day. [audience laughing] I can’t stand that. You ever download an app? And it starts asking you questions, “Hey, do you mind if I share information with your other apps?” Yes, I mind. How do you even know him? What the hell is going on? [audience laughing] They’re all up to something, those apps. You know it. That’s their goal. They wanna stay on your phone as long as possible. That’s why it’s so hard to delete an app. You ever tried to delete an app? You gotta do that hard press on the phone, first of all. All the apps start shaking. [audience laughing and clapping] Oh, they know somebody’s going. They know this. [audience laughing] This is judgement day for one of them. Looking around, seeing what each other did. You know, thinking about who’s going. That’s why they make that little x so small. It’s small in the corner. ‘Cause you can’t get it with you',\n",

This guy is relentless.” They’re thinking about what they did. Oh, he’s definitely getting rid of me. It’s not you, it’s me. I haven’t learned Spanish in 30 days. [audience laughing] This idiot couldn’t learn Spanish if he was raised in Guatemala for 30 years. [audience laughing] It’s why it’s so hard dragging an app. You ever tried to drag an app from another page? It’s like, nope. [audience laughing] Nope. I like page five. [audience laughing] I don’t trust doctors. Do you trust doctors? I don’t trust doctors, no. [audience] No! They’re killing people who don’t need to die. I read this one story. This one woman, she was comatose. She was in the hospital. And she came back to life and started breathing again moments after her family pulled the plug. Is that a good story? [audience laughing] Yeah, I mean, she’s living. That’s good. She’s back to life. That’d make for some pretty uncomfortable conversation in that hospital room. [audience laughing] Right after, when she came back. Like, she, whoa! This is amazing! I can’t believe you all were here waiting for me. My family. I love you so much. What have you guys been up to? [audience laughing] Uh, nothing, Mom, nothing. You weren’t, uh, looking so good, Mom. Frankie, unplug your iPhone, you’re at 85%, unplug it. [audience laughing] How’re you feeling, Mom? How you feeling? I feel wonderful. My side hurts a little bit. Yeah, that’s ’cause we’ve already donated all your organs. [audience laughing] They’re coming at three for your eyes. We should get a family photo before they pluck the eyes. Let’s get a family photo. Mom, get in here. Before we’re looking at two black, empty sockets. Let’s go. [audience laughing] Only God pulls the plug on me. I tell my family all the time. Absolutely, yes. I don’t care. He created me. He can take me out whenever He wants. Is it a matter of money? So what? Have a garage sale. [audience laughing] So the kids don’t go to college? Who cares? Let’s be honest, they weren’t going anyway. [audience laughing] Keep the big man breathing. Do whatever you gotta do. I tell them all the time. I don’t care. At some point, there’s gonna be that woman that walks in the room. There’s always… You know what? Kevin would not want to live this way. You falcon-punch that witch right in the throat. [audience laughing] You just grab her and… Stomp her, right there. [audience cheering and clapping] Double strike her. How about you don’t wanna live. Who’s that lady killing people? Just walking in, “He would no',\n",
              "  't wanna go on. He would not wanna do it. There’s no quality of life.” Hi-ya! [audience laughing] I had a close call too, about five years ago. I was, uh, driving home from a show and I hit a deer on the highway. It was pretty scary. It was a horrible experience, wrecked my truck. I was on the side of the road, pretty shaken up. Filling out the police report. She was asking me questions and the officer was like, “What happened? The deer just, uh, jumped out in front of you?” I was like, “What?” [audience laughing] She was like, “Did it just jump out in front of you?” [audience laughing] I was like, “No, no, it waved me over.” Um… [audience laughing] I was barreling down the road about 90 miles and hour and I was like, is that a deer calling over with its hoof? Sure enough, it was. [audience laughing] I pulled over to the side. I was like, “What’s up?” He’s like, “You’re doing like 90.” And I’m like, “Okay, that’s my business. What do you care?” He’s like, “I know you got kids at home.” He knew my kids by name, which freaked me out. I’m like, I’m not gonna talk to this guy anymore. I don’t need this. I’m outta here. He’s like, “Hold up. Hold up. I’m sorry.” He said, “I’m sorry. Let’s started over. We’ll hug it out.” And I’m like, that’s pretty cool, a deer who’s about forgiveness. [audience laughing] I said okay, and go to hug him and he goes to hug me, and he goes, “What’s that?” and he points to my shirt. I go, “What’s what?” I look down, and he did that move in my face… [audience laughing] He goes, “I know where you live.” Then he ran into the woods. I got back in my truck and I started chasing him. But I couldn’t get through the thick trees, so I got out and camped out overnight. [audience laughing] And I waited. The next morning, I saw him. He was talking to a bunch of other deer. I army crawled over to him. And I put blueberries on my face all Rambo style. He didn’t even see me. I jumped on top of him. I sank my hooks in. I slit his throat and he bled out right there on the spot. Then I dragged him, like a mile. [audience laughing] Mile and a half, back to the highway and I threw him on the hood of my truck. [audience laughing] [audience cheering and clapping] And that’s when you showed up. [audience laughing] So, no, he did not just jump out in front of me. This was premeditated deer murder. [audience laughing] Can’t talk about my kids. I have four kids. Any parents? Lot of parents out there? [audience cheering] Yeah. Yeah. Trying to be a good dad, it’s, uh, it’s tough, man. It’s really hard. These, these times, it’s difficult, you know. I’m really having a tough time trying to motivate my kids. And, I don’t know, like, I don’t ',\n",
              "  'know, is it me or is it, like, all parents? I don’t know. Are your kids lethargic? [audience laughing] ‘Cause I got a slug farm at my house. I really… [audience laughing] My kids don’t even get dressed anymore. They just get up from bed with the blanket. They have a blanket on them. They light up their iPad, it illuminates their face, and they just shuffle, shuffle. Like some weird sand creature in a Star Wars movie. Past each other and past me. No one talks anymore. [audience laughing] My son’s the worst, always on the video games. I was like, “Hey, we can’t do this, man. Let’s get some activity, you know.” I went up to him and said, “Hey. Buddy. Listen, let’s, let’s grab a football and, uh, call all your friends. We’ll get on our bikes and we’ll ride over to the field. Grab some cones, we’ll set up outlines and touchdowns and all the stuff. We’ll, we’ll have a great, great game. Awesome game. Maybe two. We’ll wait there till the lights come on in the parking lot. We’ll play a night game as well. We’ll just have a blast. And he just looked over to me and said, “I’m good.” [audience laughing] That was it. My wife goes, “Just take the video games away from him.” That’s a great idea. And I did. We took our video games away from all our kids. All the video games were done. Take them away from your kids. Yes. Yeah, we did it. [audience cheering and clapping] You gotta do it. We have to do it. It helped. It was awesome right away. First of all, the girls, my daughters, their life got so much better immediately. They were seeing friends and reading. They didn’t even care. My son had a tough time. He did. Yeah, he was having… Especially, couple days in, he started getting all shifty-eyed and stuff, looking at me just… [audience laughing] Little shaky leg. He was like an addict. He was really just kinda like… [audience laughing] I could tell he was having a tough time. He was… [audience laughing] [clears throat] Yo. Dad, yo, can I talk to you? Can I talk to your for a second? [audience laughing] Yo. C-Come over here, Brody. Let me talk to you for a second. Get away from Mom for just a second. [audience laughing] You gotta give me something to take the edge off. Give me a little something, a little brain tickler. Give me a little brain tickler. You got some Mario? [audience laughing] I was like, “No. No games, that’s it.” Okay, God bless you, sir. You have a good day. [audience laughing] You have a great day. God bless you, sir. I love you. God bless you. God loves you. You have a good day. Next day he came by, same thing. He’s a little manipulative too. You gotta watch out for him. I don’t know what he was trying to do. He was like, “Hey, ho',\n",
              "  'w about this, Dad?” [clears throat] What if I got, like, a… an Oculus? I didn’t know what an Oculus is. Do you know? I didn’t even know. I had no idea. It’s the virtual reality, if you don’t know. The goggles. You put these big goggles on your face. And you’re in virtual reality. I was like, “Is it games?” He goes, “Yeah.” I’m like, “No, you can’t have it. That’s it, no games.” He goes, “But you don’t understand. These are active games.” I go, “What do you mean?” He goes, “Oh, it’s unbelievable. They have a boxing game where you can fight like Rocky or like, you know, Apollo Creed or Mohammad Ali. It’s, like, 12 rounds. And you have, like, hand weights. You’re boxing the whole time. You’re sweating like crazy. It’s amazing.” He goes, “There’s a dance cardio game where you’re, like, going crazy. Your heart rate goes through the roof. They also have a warrior game. There’s a warrior game, Dad, you wouldn’t believe it. You’re going through this village just wielding a sword. It’s like a crazy shoulder delt workout the whole time. Everybody’s doing it. All my friends, everybody is just working out like crazy. And here’s the best part, even if it’s raining outside or snowing, doesn’t matter. ‘Cause you get your workout in. It’s awesome.” [audience softly laughing] I was like, “I don’t know. I don’t know.” I started thinking about it. I’d rather you be outside doing stuff, but maybe this is a step in the right direction. So I said, “All right, let’s get the Oculus.” And I got him the Oculus. [audience whooping] Yeah. Wanna tell you how it went down. [audience laughing] First day, he gets the Oculus. I wake up, I go downstairs into the kitchen. He’s already got it on. He’s just standing there in the kitchen. Big, fat goggles on his face, just… [audience laughing] Zero movement. Zero movement. Just standing there. I’m watching him. He doesn’t know I’m there. I walk in. I’m like, “What is this?” This is the Oculus? This is it? And he’s just there. I watch and I’m getting a little upset, but then he starts to move and I go, “Here we go.” He backs up a little bit. I’m like, “Whoa.” He doesn’t even know I’m there. He reaches under. He feels under the kitchen counter. And he gets a stool. [audience laughing] And he sits down. [audience laughing] Now I’m really getting upset. ‘Cause… he doesn’t look like he’s fighting Apollo Creed. [audience laughing] I wanna give him the benefit of the doubt. I don’t know this virtual reality. I don’t know how far it goes back. Maybe his trainer’s stuck in traffic or something. [audience laughing] But he’s just sitting there now. Just sitting there, for another two minutes. I’m getting upset. I’m about to take th',\n",
              "  'em off and he steps up. I go, “Oh, here we go.” He takes one step and levels up. He’s just standing there. I’m like, “Oh. Here we go.” He goes like this. I’m like, “All right.” Then he goes like this. Then he goes like this. I go, “Here we go.” Then he goes like this. Then he goes like this. I’m like, “Yes, he’s warming up. Look at this.” Then he goes like this. Then he goes like this. Then he goes like this. [audience laughing] And then he goes back to his perch. He just goes back. [audience laughing] I’m furious. I’m furious. But then he goes like this. He leans like this and then he goes like this. Then he goes like this. He starts going like this. [audience laughing] I’ve no idea what… No idea. Just this. I’ve had enough. I rip the goggles off his head. He’s like, “Oh, no!” Which I’m told you’re not supposed to do. It’s like waking a sleepwalker, you’re not supposed to do that. I put them on. I wanted to see what he was doing. You know what? He was playing a game. You know what game it was? Job Simulator. [audience laughing] He was working part time at a convenience store. [audience cheering and clapping] He was waiting for customers to come in his store. He was just sitting there. [audience laughing] He wasn’t active at all. He wasn’t sweeping up in between customers. Stacking cases of beer in the back. He was sitting there. He was sitting there and then, finally, a customer came in and he stepped up, leveled up, got him a pack of cigarettes or something. Rang him up, I saw the cash register was right there. Gave him the change. Nodded. He’s a polite kid. At least he’s got that going for him. Then he goes back to his chair. And I’m like, “What was this? What was this and all that?” You know what it was? He was scratching off his own lotto tickets. [audience laughing] He’s not even a good fake employee. [audience laughing] I just said, “You’re punished. That’s what it is. That’s what’s up.” I don’t know how to punish our kids anymore. I don’t even know what we can do, what we can’t do. I don’t even know what… I know our parents, our dads, they knew how to punish. Back in the day, they knew how to punish. They did. They had it exactly correct. Every… The punishment always fit the crime perfectly. Because they got the belt, that’s why. [audience laughing] Yes. You only had to get the belt once. You got the belt once, you never did whatever you were doing ever again. Then your dad just had to show you the belt. And that was enough. You remember that? Hey, what did you say? [audience laughing] Yeah, okay, I’m good. Yeah. [audience clapping] Yes. Belt worked. Remember how out of nowhere that first time you got the belt was? You were p',\n",
              "  'opping off at your mom, You go like, “Hey. Mom, I’m not having your meatloaf tonight. It’s horrible. I’m not having it. It’s very dry. Who puts peas in meatloaf? I can’t do it. I can’t. It’s way too dry. Look up the recipe, Betty Crocker. Check it out, woman. Why is Dad getting undressed? What’s going on? What are you doing? [audience laughing] “No, add ketchup to it, I don’t care. Some sauce, get it going. It’s just horrible. It’s very dry. What’s up, Dad? Are you a lion tamer? What is this? What’s this snap, snap? Snap, snap. I don’t know… Oh, my God! Oh, God!” [audience laughing] And it worked. The belt’s worked since 25 BC. It’s worked throughout history. All the way up until, like, 1993 when some frail d-bag introduced the first time out. [audience cheering and clapping] And that’s when we lost society, right there. When everything burns and civilization comes to an end, we can trace it all the way back to that one guy. That’s the guy. Time out. It changed the game. Time out? How can you do that? Can you imagine trying to convince your dad to give you a time out back in the day? Hey, Dad, listen up. Very sorry about stealing your car last night, taking it for a joy ride. Doing donuts in that parking lot and wiping out that whole store front, but how’s about this? [audience laughing] Instead of you whipping this ass with that leather strap and that massive belt buckle you got in New Orleans… [audience laughing] I’m thinking I’m gonna wander off over into the corner for a little bit. [audience laughing] Maybe think about where I went wrong, maybe not. I don’t even know. I don’t know what I’m gonna do. I might sing a song, I might hum one. It doesn’t matter. Important thing is, it’s my time, it’s my time over in that corner. And when I feel good enough, and I feel like I’m ready to inject myself back into society, I will come back here and I will tell you and we’ll see how that goes. How do you feel about that, cowboy? How’s that? [audience cheering and clapping] Why are you getting undressed again? What’s going on? [audience laughing] Time out. They don’t even do time outs anymore. Now time outs are too cruel. They’ve become too cruel. Time outs. Oh, the ch… No, you can’t. What? You can’t do a time out. It’s too cruel for the child. They’re alone. They’re isolated. They’re in the corner of the room. By themselves. There are other people. They’re just… No, they’re way… It’s in a corner. They’re looking at two walls meeting. It’s, it’s too much for the child to deal with. You can’t isolate them like that. Any… You can’t. You just can’t isolate them. They don’t even do that anymore. They don’t do time outs anymore ’cause it’s too muc',\n",
              "  'h. They do what’s called a time in. It’s called a time in. I’m serious. What they do is the dad will take the child, you sit in the middle of the room, they put the child next to them, they stroke their shoulder and… You both kinda go over what went wrong and kinda where… the child went off the tracks. And… Once you start making them feel good about being bad… [audience laughing] Probably after, like, seven or eight minutes, you just let them go. Then you stay there for, like, an additional four minutes. [audience laughing] Just to think about what a loser of a parent you’ve become. [audience cheering and clapping] We’re raising baby veal. That’s what we’re doing. We are. We are. We are. We’re so easy on our kids. And so what? It doesn’t help them. I love my kids. We all love our kids. We know that. But you know what? They all can’t be the best. They can’t. Not right away, anyway. This is what we tell them, constantly. You’re the best. You are the best. You are so good. You are the best. You’re the best. Isn’t he the best? Yeah. He’s the best. You’re the best. He’s the best. You’re so good. You’re the best. [loud sigh] No, you suck. [audience laughing] You’re not… What are you the best at? We wanna get you to be the best, but you can’t do anything right now. What can you do? Can you match your socks? Can you do a back flip? Can you black tar a driveway? Can you roll a cigar? Can you drive a forklift? Can you put your toothbrush back in the cup when you’re done using it? [audience laughing and clapping] Nothing. Without me, you can do nothing. If I dropped you off in the woods you wouldn’t last ten minutes before you were eaten by coyotes. [audience laughing] Kids suck. They suck. [audience laughing] They’re not good. They’re not good. That should, that’s the definition of a kid. “You suck.” That’s what they should be called. How many you-sucks do you have? I’ve got one and two on the way. [audience laughing] Twin you-sucks? That’s amazing. Congratulations. Thank you. [audience laughing] Your kids suck. My kids suck. I’m sorry to break it to you. There’s one kid I saw on the internet. One kid. This four-year-old Korean boy. He was playing Mozart on an accordion. He had something special, nobody else. [audience laughing] But 100% he got the belt. Oh, he definitely got the belt. Oh, he was Mozarting his ass off. He was like… [audience laughing] That’s how you get good. [audience laughing] My son wanted to play Little League. So I called the coach. I said, “Listen, my boy wants to play. Is it okay if he joins the team?” He’s like, “Yeah, we didn’t even start practicing yet. We practice Thursday night.” I said, “That’s wonderful. It’s awe',\n",
              "  'some. And, uh, I’ll bring him down.” He says, “Yeah, I just wanna let you know that we don’t keep score in this league.” [audience laughing softly] I say, “Why? Why not?” He’s like, “We don’t wanna upset… the parents and disappoint any of the kids, so we don’t keep score.” I was like, “Why even have them bat?” Why not just have them walk up to the plate, “Hi, how’re you doing?” [audience laughing] Could you put me down for a double? [audience laughing] Yeah, my mother says I preregistered for a double. I got a double. Thank you. I got a double, Mother! [audience laughing] A double. I got a double. Every kid gets a trophy. You know how I found out? There was a $40 charge on my bill. I was like… [audience laughing] What’s this right here? He like, “That’s for trophies.” We didn’t even have a practice yet. He’s like, “Congratulations, you guys won. You guys are champions.” [audience laughing] I’m like, “Who?” He’s like, “Everyone.” Everyone? Me? He goes, “Yeah. Did you drive him here?” I go, “Yes.” He goes, “Congratulations, you’re a winner.” [audience laughing] I played Little League in the 1970s. Played for five years. Got a trophy once. One year. That’s it. One trophy. You know why? ‘Cause we won. That’s it. [audience cheering and clapping] You know how I know? ‘Cause we kept score. [audience laughing] You know why we did that? ‘Cause that’s how baseball’s played. The team with the larger number, the more runs, they’re the winners. And the losers are the team with the less numbers. They’re the losers and they go home as a team and they try to come back and do better. And sometimes that drive actually helps them. That’s actually the better choice, to lose and try to come back, because it’s human nature. Human nature. [audience cheering] It’s good for them. One trophy. That’s all I had. I would go in my room and see that one trophy. I’d be like, “Oh, yeah. That’s the year we won.” That’s it. The one time. That was worth it. It was great. I went to my neighbor’s house. His living room is littered with trophies. I know his kids. I’m like, “This is criminal.” [audience laughing] I’m like, “What’s this one for?” Oh, that’s when Warren was gonna try out for photography club. [audience laughing] But he got a cold and missed the season. It says “MVP.” Yes, we’re very proud of him. [audience laughing softly] They’re so fortunate, kids today. They have the greatest fields, I see them, I see them here. The pristine sod and the outfield walls. With the sponsors and the, and the lights for night games. Kidding me? I played in the 70s and they had none of that. You pull up to, like, a parking lot with cement and clumps of grass and broken Schmidt’s',\n",
              "  ' bottles everywhere. Just… Is this field two? Yeah, this is field two. This is us. Your coach would pull up in a 1971 Impala, pop the trunk to hand out uniforms. [imitates trunk squeaking open] Had everything in that trunk. Clearly thrown out of his house ten minutes ago by his wife. [audience laughing] Smoking right in front of us. [audience laughing] Gather round, guys, gather round, team. Get around me. Make a circle. Listen to me, if it’s a hit to right field… shortstop got it covered. Second base… don’t overthrow the cutoff man, okay. You’re overthrowing the… Like a nicotine oscillating fan right in our faces. [audience laughing] No parents running over, “Hey, Phil, maybe you shouldn’t smoke in front of the kids.” You kidding me? They’re setting up snack tables, playing dominoes, drinking vodka, about 30 yards that way. [audience cheering and clapping] They’re just so happy the weird guy in the polyester pants and bushy mustache is looking after them for a while. Right in my face. Benson and Hedges. It stung right in the retinas. Stinging me like crazy. Smoke billowing down my body. But you know what? No allergies today. [audience cheering and clapping] Nada. I eat whatever I want. I can see a raccoon walking around midday. Just rip it’s face off, clumps of hair missing, doesn’t matter. I can just eat that thing whole and be fine an hour later. [audience laughing] You know why? ‘Cause I drank water out of a hose that was rolled up in my backyard. [audience cheering and clapping] That sat outside in the grass in the hot sun for months at a time, melting that plastic. It boiled up so much it would burn your face. It wouldn’t even come out in a steady stream. You’d be p-p-p-p-p… [audience laughing] Firing rusty spickets through that thing like BBs into the back of your throat until it wasn’t enough and you just ripped the hose off the faucet and wrapped your lips around that. [audience laughing] Just suck all the asbestos and lead right out of the house. Just… [audience laughing] Go right to the source and I was fine. Why was I fine? ‘Cause all day long at school I’m chewing on pencils. [audience laughing] I’m sniffing magic markers like they’re going out of style. Thirty seconds a nostril. Have some fun. Get used to it. Eating paste ’cause it looked like mayonnaise. [audience laughing] Or Play-Doh. How good did Play-Doh smell? Smelled amazing. You try it, like, whoa, different story. [audience laughing] Next day, you try it again. Different color. You’re like, “Maybe this is fruit flavored. Try.” [audience laughing softly] We had allergies and things back in the day. We just didn’t label everything. I’m sure I had anxiety. I know ',\n",
              "  'I did. I was a pitcher. I was eight years old. I remember this. I had a really strong arm. I was on the mound. I was firing the ball, aiming it, and I was missing the plate. I started walking batters and it was getting to me. I loaded up the bases and I was breathing heavy. I felt it. I felt this heaviness. And it was bothering me. I started trying harder and I was walking more batters. I started walking runs in. I’m looking at my friends in the field and they were looking at me and I felt terrible. I remember this. ‘Cause I remember my dad, who was also a coach, he walked out to the mound and he gave me the greatest advice I’ve ever received in my entire life. He literally walked up to the mound, he put both hands on my shoulder, looked me dead in the eyes and says, “Hey. Stop aiming the ball. You know what to do.” He said two words. “Just throw.” That’s all he said. “Just throw.” He turned around and he walked back to the dugout. And I remember it’s the greatest advice I’ve ever received in my entire life. Think about it. Anytime life has got you down, there are obstacles you gotta overcome. Just throw. That’s all you gotta do. Just throw. Yes. Believe in yourself. [audience cheering and clapping] Trust yourself. And just throw. And that’s what I did. I launched back into my windup and I just threw. And I shattered the kid’s cheekbone. I remember… [audience laughing and clapping] Ball bounced like 30 yards, two more runs scored. So my Dad was wrong there. You gotta aim the ball. [audience laughing] In baseball. That’s the… That’s like where… That’s the worst advice ever. To just, just throw it in baseball. Then you’re just running around, just throwing at everything. You can’t. You gotta… [audience laughing] Doesn’t work in baseball. But anywhere else in life, it’s great advice. Great advise. Just throw. Just do it. He was smart. My dad was a smart man. Never went to college. Didn’t have to. Didn’t know all subjects, but he knew subjects in depth. He had depth to the subject. That was it. He knew it. He knew it well. I don’t have that. I don’t know, my Dad was handing me the, uh, knowledge baton. He was literally like, “Here it is. From generation to generation. This is all the wisdom and intelligence of our family. And I’m giving it to you, my son.” And I was like… I’m good. [audience laughing] I don’t feel like reading that thing right now. I paid for it. ‘Cause he could answer any question I ever had. And I know nothing now. As an adult, I’m faking it. That’s why I hate having conversations. ‘Cause I don’t know enough. I know things, but I don’t have any in-depth knowledge. I can’t go deep. Still water does not go deep. That’s w',\n",
              "  'hy, anybody talks to me, it’s literally like they say something and I have zero point of view. I can’t add anything to it. I’m just like, oh, oh, yeah, yeah. [audience laughing] One subject, one subject I know a lot about. Buster Douglas. Remember him? Remember the heavy-weight champ who upset Mike Tyson back in 1990? At the Tokyo Dome. Forty-two to one odds. Mike Tyson was 37-and-0 at the time. 55,000 people there. I know all this. You know why I know it? Because ESPN had a 30 for 30 on it and I recorded it and watched it, like, 12 times. So I have all this information about Buster Douglas. Here’s the thing. Hardly ever comes up in conversation. [audience laughing] That’s how dumb I was. I put all my eggs in the Buster Douglas basket. [audience laughing] And my wife, this was the worst. We got invited to this local municipal government fundraising dinner. It was, like, every word I hated in there. Except dinner. I was fine with that. [audience laughing] Hope you said no. She was like, “I accepted.” Why would you do that? I don’t wanna talk to anybody. I can’t. I don’t know anything about government. They’re gonna make me look like an idiot. I don’t wanna do it. She’s like, “Relax.” She’s good at talking. She’s like, “I’ll go with you. I’ll be there the whole time. I promise you, we’ll mingle around, we’ll have some hors d’oeuvres, we’ll have a little dinner, and then we’ll leave. And I’ll stay with you the whole time.” You promise? She’s like, “Yes.” As soon as we get there she goes, “I’ll be right back. I have to go the bathroom.” And she takes off. [audience laughing] Some guy walks over to me. He says, “Hey.” I’m like, “Oh, gosh, here we go. Hey!” How about this whole Figueroa thing as councilman? Tell you one thing, he ain’t gonna last, huh? [audience laughing] Let’s break it down, shall we? First, don’t know who Figueroa is. Don’t know… You know what a councilman is? Do have any idea? He could’ve said carrot-maker. It wouldn’t have made a difference. I’ve no idea what a councilman is. [audience laughing] How do I answer? I wanna look like I know, so I go, “Really?” Like I’m concerned for Figueroa. He goes, “Yeah, really.” I go, “Why?” He goes, “I’ll give you one reason why. Treason.” I was like, “Treason? You gotta be kidding me.” In my head, I’m going, you don’t even know what treason means. [audience laughing] You don’t know the definition of treason. I don’t know… Did you ever break away from a conversation mentally to try to figure out a word that somebody just launched at you? You’re in your head, going, break it down. Treason. What does it mean? Treason. Well, tree is in the front, reason is in the back. Trees… are reason',\n",
              "  'able. Maybe he’s talking about the environment. Get in there and talk about the environment. So I go back to talk to him and he’s just staring at me. So I don’t know how long I was out for, you know. I don’t know if he asked me a question or not. He’s just staring at me. I’m starting to sweat, ’cause I don’t know what to say. I’m feeling uncomfortable. And he doesn’t say… So I go to my fallback, which is this. It’s great. I just go, “Yeah, it’s all crazy anyway. What are you gonna do, right? He’s supposed to say, “Yeah, it’s nuts. Anyway, you have a good night.” You too. But he doesn’t. He goes, “What’s crazy?” I go, “I don’t know. No one’s ever answered my question with a question before.” [audience laughing] Just the whole thing. He’s like, “What whole thing?” How it all went down. He’s like, “What went down?” Motherf… Just leave me alone! [audience laughing] He was trying to expose my stupidity. He wouldn’t stop. He was not letting me go. He was chasing me, like I was an opossum running behind a dumpster and he had a flashlight in my face. What did you say? No, you’re dumb. What did you say? You’re very dumb. You don’t know who Figueroa is. Who is Figueroa? No, you don’t. Who is Figueroa? Who is Figueroa? Who is he? You don’t… Name the three branches of government. [audience laughing] I’ll spot you Legislative. [audience cheering and clapping] I should just be honest with people. I should just walk up, “Hi, my name’s Kevin. I got about a fourth grade vocabulary.” [audience laughing] I’m gonna get lost pretty quickly into the conversation, but I’ll stay here and I’ll nod my head and I’ll smile, make you feel better about yourself, but don’t be fooled, I am dead behind the eyes. [audience laughing and clapping] I don’t do that. I try to match. I try to match. I throw in big words I don’t even know. What do you think the problem with society is? I go, “I gotta be honest. I harken…” Har… Harken. [audience laughing] I’ve never said “harken” before in my life. Harken? What am I? Winston Churchill? Where… It behooves me to think that… my monocle and my, mm, pocket watch, ha-ha, burlap brown pants, working on the cobble stone in London, fatty, fatty, fatty pants. Fatty pants. Walking in London rain. Who am I? Mm, pipe. Who am I? Harken. Or I answer too quickly. What do you think the problem with the culture is? I’m like, “I know what it is.” I know what it is? [audience laughing] I go, “I think it’s a lack of conscious.” Conte-ness. Consci-ness. He’s like, “What?” You ever not even be sure of the tense of a word? C… It’s a lack of con… conscience-ness. [audience laughing] I’m sorry, what did you say? C-Con… It’s a lack of consciention… [a',\n",

[audience laughing] And the dinosaurs are here. That’s what I’m saying. I’m sorry, I’m not following you. I went… [scoffs] Irregardless of that, I gotta tell you… I said it. [audience laughing and clapping] Oh, he stopped me, “That’s not even a word.” I beg to differ. He’s like, “I’m sorry, you’re not making any sense.” [audience laughing softly] You know what else didn’t make sense? When Buster Douglas upset Mike Tyson back in 1990. [audience cheering and clapping] At the Tokyo Dome. 55,000 people. Forty-two to one odds. You have a good night, sir. Have a good night, sir. [audience clapping] That’s when my wife walked out of the bathroom. What did I miss? Anything good? Ha-ha. Okay. All right. My wife’s awesome. I love her so much. She… We’re an amazing fit because she loves to talk. She’s like the balance to me. She’s so good at it. She can talk to people. She knows what questions to ask. She just loves it. I remember, that night we got in the car to drive home. She just started talking again. I was like, “Hey. You know, we don’t need it now. We…” [audience laughing] We don’t need to talk ever again. [audience laughing] We don’t. That’s a good thing. We’ve been together, like, 20 years. I’ve already said every word I’m ever gonna say to her in every combination. That’s it. And she said every word to me. She knows everything about me. I know everything about her. We don’t need to talk anymore. We can finish out the rest of our life with gestures. That’s it. [audience laughing] Not her. She loves to talk. She loves it. She’s just one of those people. She just loves it. Loves the sound of her internal voice. She’s like, “Uh…” Loves the vibration of her lips on her teeth or something. The whole nine yards. Whatever’s involved with talking, she… [makes noises] Ever hear a baby whenever they find their voice? They’re ma-ma-ma-ma. Brr… Brr… Brr… La-la. Brr… She just goes. I don’t think she’s ever had an unexpressed thought in her life. [audience laughing] No. Everything she sees, it goes right in, and she has to say it. She just, “Oh, my gosh, this door’s so squeaky. That picture’s crooked, I can’t believe that. We’re gonna make eggplant for Thursday. We’ll have some friends over. Would that be good? Look at my reflection in the mirror. I see two of me.

I keep it in there. Not my wife. She doesn’t have any barn doors. It’s just free-range thoughts. I see it. I say it. I see it in the senses and I say it. Look at those exit signs. The light. The floor. Everything is… I see it. I say it. I see it. I say it. It’s like a verbal wood chipper. [imitates chipper whirring] [audience laughing] I see it. I say it. I gotta say it when I see it. I see it. I say it. I gotta say it. [imitates chipper whirring] [audience laughing] Hey. There’s an ebb and flow to conversations. There is. Fifty percent is listening. It’s like double Dutch. You gotta wait for your turn. [audience laughing] Not her. She’s in there the whole time. Like… I got this. This is my talk. This is my talk. Back it off. Can someone else talk? Get outta here, [unclear], this is me. Big Mac, Fillet-o-Fish, Quarter Pounder, French Fries, I see Coke, milkshake, sundaes, and apple pie. [audience cheering and clapping] You wanna talk? Talk. Go in your closet, take your clothes off, and talk all night long. But why do I have to be there? [audience laughing] It’s this emotional backboard. She doesn’t care what I think or say. She wants me there. Why? Talk. Go. I always gotta be there, though. I’m literally brushing my teeth. Getting ready for bed. And I hear it. [audience laughing] Telling me things. That I experienced with her. I was with her all day. [audience laughing] Can’t believe Alan stood up in front of everybody revealing facts about his son. I didn’t like that at all. I couldn’t believe it. Could you believe it? In my head, I’m going, “Yes, I can. You know why? ‘Cause I was there.” [audience laughing] This was your point of view. [audience laughing] This was mine. I was there. I experienced everything with you! Na-na-na-na-na… Talking herself to sleep. Literally talking herself through sleep. You know how much you wanna go to sleep and you’re tired? And she’s still fighting it. [mumbling] [exhale, mumbling] [mumbling] Finally. It goes quiet. Sweet quiet. You go to bed. Next morning I wake up. [audience laughing softly] I’m brushing my teeth. And it starts up again in the other room. [audience laughing] I’m like, “What new knowledge did you pick up…” [audience laughing] “…overnight?” What did you get? What could you have picked up? Nothing new happened. [audience laughing so',\n",
              "  'ftly] But she wants me there. She wants me in that conversation. Again, doesn’t care about what I have to say. Does… doesn’t matter. She wants me there. And she tries to get me snagged into these conversations. She’ll like lob out half sentences to me. That’s what she’ll do. She’ll lob them out like she fly fishing to try to catch me. [loud sigh] I sure hope Ellen’s gonna be okay. [audience laughing] I usually let the first one just pass by. [audience laughing] ‘Cause if enough time passes, I can just kinda… [mumbles] [audience laughing] But there’s always a follow-up. Sure hope they can work through this. Okay, we gotta engage. [audience laughing] I’m thinking, “What’s our plan?” Our plan is, we wanna get outta here as quickly as possible. We have so much stuff to do. But we can’t try to shorten the conversation. We know that, ’cause she’ll sense that. She’s good at that. And then she’ll tack on 45 minutes just out of spite, so… [audience laughing softly] What if I steer into it? What if I go in the other way? It’s dangerous, but it’s… Risky move, but it could pay off. Let’s just go into it and I did it. Hey, honey. Yeah. Let’s do it. Let’s do what? Let’s just talk about Helen all morning long. [audience laughing] Let’s just do it. We’ll grab a couple of beanbag chairs. Put on a pot of coffee. We’ll sit down. You tell me everything about Helen from conception to this morning. [audience laughing] Let’s do it. Let’s just get knee-deep in Helen. What do you say? Okay, first of all, it’s Ellen. It’s not Helen. There’s no H, okay? [audience laughing] She’s my friend from Pilates who you don’t know. She’s going through some stuff right now. But let’s do it. Let’s just do it anyway. I don’t care. I wanna learn about her. And I wanna be here to learn about her, with you. What do you say? [loud exhale] [audience laughing] No. I promised her I wouldn’t say anything to anybody. [audience laughing] Okay. I really wanted to be here for you. I love you. I just wanted to let you know that. I’ll see you later, okay. [audience cheering and clapping] There’s always a follow-up. All right, I’ll tell you. But you gotta promise me you’re not gonna tell anybody else. Promise you? I can’t do that. What if I’m playing softball with the guys? And we’re warming up and I’m throwing with my buddy and he’s like, “Hey, anything going on with your wife’s friends at Pilates that I should know about?” [audience laughing] I can’t believe you brought that up. Yes. Guys, bring it in. Everybody, bring it in, both teams. Come out of the dugout. Everybody, take a knee. I wanna tell you about my wife’s friend Ellen or Helen, who I don’t know, from Pilates.

              " ['[Announcer] Ladies and gentlemen, Larry, The Cable Guy! [crowd cheer and applaud] All right. Thank you. Please remain seated. Do not rush the stage. Thank you. Well, this is awesome.! Who cancelled? Thank you so much… for having me. This is a good-looking crowd. I’ll tell you what. Right now, Cracker Barrel’s wondering where all the regulars are, right? Look at this. This is good-looking! Well, good to be in Joliet! That’s right. [crowd cheer and applaud] I bet that’s the first time you ever heard that. [all laughing] I’m only kidding. Hey, I’m glad– Hey, look, I gave up a colonoscopy to be here, all right? So… This is a big deal for me, too, so thank you for coming. Daggum good-looking folks in Illinois. I’ll tell you that much. I love you, which begs the question, “What state are you from?” [all laughing] I’m only serious. All right, anyway. No, I’ll see you at the house. God bless you. Thank you. We’re gonna have fun tonight, I tell you. I’d done a show last night, and the folks that didn’t walk out on me really enjoyed it, so, uh… I always like to picture everybody naked when I first come out. You know, I’m not nervous or nothing. I’m just a pervert, so… [all laughing] Daggum, you need to put your clothes back on right here. -Aah, what is that? [crowd laughing] [chuckles] You should picture me without clothes on. Then you’d be laughing so hard, I wouldn’t have to tell any jokes up here. Sorry about my outfit. I just come from a wedding, so I apologize for that, but… It was a weird wedding, too. They had the father-daughter dance. They ended up leaving together. [all laughing] All right, one more joke like that, I’m getting the hell out of here, all right, ’cause th-that’s uncalled for, right there. I guess I should do this. Git-R-Done! [all cheering] That’s right, Git-R-Done! You know, the first phrase– That wasn’t my original phrase. The first one I’d come up with was “Yipper-dipper-ripper-scripper!” [crowd chuckles] I know, right? It wouldn’t fit on a hat, plus, I don’t know what the hell it means! All right? No idea. I was going to, uh, work out, this morning, but, I, uh– I woke up with a sweat, so I figured I already had done there, so, uh… [crowd laughing] Almost didn’t make it here tonight. Uh… I hate flying in airplanes. I had to fly to meet my bus, and I hate flying them daggum airplanes, and the daggum airport wouldn’t let me bring my emotional support stripper with me on the airplane. [all laughing] I ain’t kidding. When that plane gets a-goin’ like that, if I can’t motorboat a pair of titties, I’m in trouble. [all laughing] All right? It was so windy where I live one time, I lost my hat, two cigars, and my neighbor’s house. Lost his house, ’cause one of my cigars blowed in his trailer and burned his house down, all right? So let’s keep that to ourselves. It got out of control, too, it burnt down Cheryl’s she',\n",
              "  '-shed. [all laughing] All right? That’s right. Now you know the whole story right there. You know the whole story. Tonight’s a special night for me. Tonight is the 10-year anniversary when my hometown gave me the keys to the city and had a little parade for me. -So, uh, thank you so much. [applause] Thank you. Remain seated. Thank you. And tomorrow is the 10-year anniversary, again, when they, uh, changed all the locks in the city, all right? Well, it’s cold wintertime again. Do you like the winter? [crowd moaning] I hate it. I like summer better than winter. That winter kills me. My weenie’s been an innie for the last five days in here. Can’t– I ain’t kiddin’. I could flash a cop and not get in any trouble right now. It snowed the other day. I can only pee my initials in the snow, all right? But my upper body loves cold weather. My lower body can’t handle it. I wish they’d get together on the weather. It gets cold out… [clicks tongue] You could play “This Little Piggy” on my daggum nipples. He hates you, but they love– These little piggies went to market! Yeah, well, that little hog stayed home, all right? I guarantee you that. It’s cold everywhere. I was in Los Angeles, California. It’s so cold, I’d seen a junkie with his tongue stuck to the spoon, all right? My wife’s from Wisconsin. You think you guys get cold? Go to Wisconsin. Holy smokes. We was up there Thanksgiving. You know how cold it was up there? How cold was it?! That sucked! -Um… [all laughing] It was so cold in Wisconsin, the ice cream machine at McDonald’s was working. [all laughing] Now, I like hot weather. I like when it’s hot and humid. I love that. I lived in Florida for a long time. I love hot and humid. It was so hot down there one time, I seen a squirrel putting talcum powder on his nuts. [all laughing] Now, I don’t like it when it’s hot and humid and I gotta wear blue jeans everywhere. Holy mackerel, walking like this. Uh, we could film four episodes of Swamp People in my pants, all right? It was bad. I went in for a physical, dropped my underbritches, three mushrooms fell out. All right? [all laughing] I ain’t kiddin’! That explains why I kept getting followed by that truffle pig right there. I knew that much. I was two days away from them declaring my crotch a wetland area. [crowd chuckling] But they try to scare everybody now with the heat, don’t they? Try to scare you, make it hotter than it is. When I was growing up, 99 degrees was 99 degrees. Now it’s 99 degrees out, but the feels like temperature’s 103. It feels like? Who come up with that? A fisherman? The “feels like” temperature? Stupid! You know what? My wiener’s three inches, but it feels like nine! [all laughing and clapping] It’s ridiculous. It’s ridiculous. Well, my wife sent me up to the grocery store all by myself the other day to get some feminine products. You know. Celery, carrot',\n",
              "  's, lettuce. [all laughing] Heh! I had to buy some chewing tobacco so I don’t look like a pajama boy sissy in there. Anybody chew tobacco? [man] Yeah! That guy. Ma’am, you. All right, perfect. That’s good. I like chewing tobacco, but I only do it ’cause it keeps you from eating sugar and eating bad food late at night, so… you can see that’s working out real good for me right now. That’s– Now I’m fat, and I got bad teeth! What the hell? I hate that grocery store self-checkout. What in the world? All the enjoyment of working at the store without the satisfaction of getting a paycheck. That’s always nice. You like self-checkout? I hate it. Every time I go in there, I get stuck behind some idiot trying to find a bar code on a cucumber in there. [crowd chuckling] You ever done this? You ever buy a Kit Kat bar? You got like 12 items, you got a Kit Kat bar, and then they look at you and go, “You gonna take that, or you want that in a bag?” That’s when you know you’re a fat-ass right there, all right? I know. They pissed me off last week. They done that with potato salad I had in there. I know! And they put a napkin and a fork on the daggum thing for me! [blows raspberry] Excuse me. Have you, uh… Have you ever seen somebody at the grocery store– You ever seen a fella in there staring at a head of cabbage? I was up there one time. I seen a dude all by himself staring at a head of cabbage. I got a theory about that. That guy’s wife sent him up there to get a head of lettuce. [all chuckling] All cabbage ought to come with a label on it that says, “This is not what your wife wants you to buy.” Three days before Thanksgiving, my wife sends me up to the grocery store to get some yams. 45 daggum minutes, I’m looking for yams. I can’t find a daggum yam. I come home. I said, “They ain’t got no yams up there.” She goes, “You mean to tell me three days before Thanksgiving, they don’t got no sweet potatoes at the grocery store?” [crowd chuckling] “I’ll be right back.” [crowd cheering] Yeah. Christmas is my favorite time of year, it goes too quick. But, you know, at our house, we celebrate Christmas every day, and I’ll tell you why. Two reasons. Number one, we love the Lord Jesus. He was born on Christmas Day. -That’s why we celebrate it. And, uh… [crowd cheering] Number two, my sister looks like Burl Ives. [all laughing] I don’t eat good at Christmas, I’ll tell you that much. I got a Fitbit on Christmas Eve, I put it on, it dialed 911. [all laughing] You know what killed me at Christmas last year foodwise? The Kentucky Fried Chicken 12 day Advent Calendar. Holy smokes! Them five golden wings had me turtle-doving all the way to the bathroom. I guarantee you. I ain’t kidding. I could have dropped my pants and dropped a partridge out of a pear tree right there, I guarantee you. Every time I start getting a little too fat at Christmas, so my kids ',\n",
              "  'will buy me a Christmas gift to hint around that I’m too fat. You know what they got me last year? A petri dish with flesh-eating bacteria. [all laughing] We run our kids up to the Walmart last year to see the Christmas Village up there. We wasn’t there more than 10 minutes. Somebody was already running a meth lab out of the gingerbread house. [all laughing] The hell? I mean, I love shopping at Walmart, but daggum, that’s like a meth maker’s paradise in there, ain’t it? [chuckles] Walmart’s the only store in the world you can go and see somebody buying 16 boxes of cough syrup and some garden hose, nobody thinks that’s weird. [all laughing] You ever shopped at Walmart after midnight? Holy smokes! Ho, they ought to charge a cover charge in there after midnight. Daggum, it’s like a casting call for Ripley’s Believe It Or Not in that place. If you’ve never been to the circus, go to Walmart after midnight. You’re bound to see a couple of bearded women, a toothless wonder, and the fattest man in the world on a scooter up there. They got good deals after midnight, though. Last time I was up there after midnight, 75% off self-esteem. [all chuckling] That’s right. I walked in there like this. I walked out like this. I was like this. Oh. [audience cheering] That’s right. You can get everything at Walmart. Except good customer service. Holy smokes! Here’s my impression of the hiring practices at Walmart. Let me ask you this. Have you ever cared about anything in your entire life? [all laughing] [sighs] No? All right. You start Tuesday, all right? [chuckles] We’ll put you in the DVD department. My wife wanted to go to Walmart. She’s trying to find the cheapest mop, she could get for something she was doing, so we go to Walmart and get a mop, $4.95. Go up there to pay for the mop, and the lady goes, “You wanna buy the protection on this?” [all chuckling] You know what? I think we’re gonna risk it this time, all right? Got a 95% chance we’re gonna throw that away when we’re done with it, anyways. At our Super Walmart, you can get your hair cut. They got everything! My buddy got his haircut at Walmart. $20 for a haircut. Actually, $5 for a haircut, $15 for the hat you gotta wear the next three weeks, all right? Got a doctor’s office up at the Walmart. Holy smokes! People going in there. I was there the other day. They gave a guy three minutes to live in there. And he ended up getting hired as a door greeter once he walked out that door. [all laughing] [chuckles] I had to go get a flu shot one time. I didn’t wanna go to the doctor, and my wife goes, “Well, shoot! Run up to Walmart. They’re giving flu shots!” Are you kiddin’ me? I ain’t gettin’ a flu shot at Walmart! Daggum. Normally I gotta get vaccinated before I go in there! [all laughing] Get a flu shot at Walmart! The flu’s the last thing I’m worried about at Walmart, all right? Daggu',\n",
              "  'm, they probably got Ebola behind a box in there somewhere I didn’t know about. I was up there one time. There’s a dude up front in a hazmat suit! I’m like, “Is it safe to go in there?” He goes, “Yeah, why?” I go, “You’re in a hazmat suit!” He goes, “No, I work here. I’m collecting the carts.” [all laughing] So every time I go up my local Walmart, I’m friends with a lot of folks up there, but every time I go up there, I see Doug. I always wave to Doug. I walk in, “What’s up, Doug?” Doug kinda, “Hey.” You know, every time, “Hey, Doug!” Let me ask you something. Have you ever called somebody the wrong name for about five years? [all laughing] [laughing] They don’t even acknowledge you’re calling ’em the wrong name? They just make you look like a douche bag for five years. Well, I finally got to talking to Doug three days ago. Her name’s Denise. [all laughing and applauding] [chuckles] So my buddy rented out– He wanted to save money on his wedding. He rented out a Walmart, got married at a Walmart. It was unbelievable. Got married in the jewelry department, and we had the reception in the deli over there, and… we all got our pictures took in the photo booth, and then we left, and they had their honeymoon in the men’s room. It was unbelievable, and there’s– It was a wedding made in China. Let me ask you this. Have you ever gotten a wedding invitation from somebody that you barely know? What the hell? It’s like gettin’ a bill in the mail. I hate weddings. I was in one a while back, holy smokes! I ain’t saying the bride was overweight, but whoo! My buddy caught the garter belt. He’s still been using it to tie up cordwood on his pickup truck, all right? Boy, these were some– You should have seen the bridesmaids! Their corsages was personal pan pizzas, all right? [crowd laughing] I ain’t kiddin’ with you. They all went to school together. They was in the same sorority, so they had their sorority shirts on, you know, “Thelma Eda Tater.” My uncle just got married, 72 years old. My golly. He run out of Viagra on the honeymoon. So he ended up having to use a can of Fix-a-Flat. [all laughing] I know. To make a long story short, he overinflated, and, uh… spent the rest of the night at Jiffy Lube having to get a patch put on him down there. Hey, this is crazy. True story. Check this out. My mother-in-law, last month, won $400 in a hot-dog-eating contest. It’s unbelievable, $400! 40 hot dogs in 10 minutes, she ate. I couldn’t believe it! [scoffs] My mother-in-law not talking for 10 minutes! [all laughing] [applause] I know. Oh, she talks. I know! She can talk. She’s the only woman at the beach getting melanoma on her tongue, all right? I guarantee you. I’m not a big gambler. My– My grandma, holy mackerel. I’m not saying she’s addicted to Blackjack, but she’s got a medical alert bracelet on that says, “In case of emergencies, split the kin',\n",
              "  'gs.” [all laughing] My wife likes to go with me when I go to Las Vegas, ’cause she likes to go see the Chippendales. Yeah. You know why she likes going to the Chippendales? Why, Larry? She didn’t marry very good. [all laughing] She married a chunkendale. [all laughing] She gives me money to put my clothes back on’s what she does. I like going out there to Las Vegas. That’s where you see all the 1970s-80s classic rock bands singing out there, you know? I like them bands. [cheering] Yeah, the only difference between seeing them bands now and 30 years ago, 30 years ago, go backstage, smell that pot everywhere, and now it smells like pot and Bengay, you go back of them things. They all still got long hair, too, Ain’t that somethin’? Unfortunately, it’s coming out their nose and ears on most of them fellas in there. Here’s one thing you never wanna hear a classic rock band say when you go to the concert. “Here’s one off our new album.” “Honey, let’s go get a beer. Nobody wants to hear that bullshit.” [audience laughing and clapping] No, sir! I went to see Molly Hatchet, and that was awesome right there. I like old Molly Hatchet. You know what was cool about it? After the concert was over, true story, I got to go in the lobby and take a picture with all the cardboard cutouts of the original members. [all laughing] I like going to the buffets out there, to casino buffets. They delicious. You ever been to the all-you-can-eat pasta buffet at the casino? Holy smokes! That’s the day I got red-flagged by the Plumbers Union right there, I’ll you what? Whoo! I had to keep a hard hat by the toilet for three weeks after I went in there. You ever use all the paper and have to end up finishing with the tube? Have you ever done that at all, anybody? I haven’t done it. I’m asking if you’ve had to do that! I ain’t done that! [crowd chuckling] We got a winner right here. We got a winner. [cheering and applaud] [chuckles] People got no manners at them daggum buffets. There was a guy actually sitting at the buffet! Pissed me off. I walk up there, “You know, you ain’t supposed to stick your face right in the dag–” [grunts] I felt bad he was in a wheelchair. Oh, man. Believe me, I felt bad. Not as bad as I felt, though, when I pushed him out of the way, I’ll tell you that much. “Get out of the way, roller boy.” I’m about to make some bad decisions right here.” [chuckles] I love that Golden Corral, that’s a good restaurant right there. Oh, that is good in there. They ought to have a scoring system at Golden Corral like they do in bowling, you know? Walk in there to eat, they put your name up on the TV screen and show everybody how much food you ate after 10 trips to the buffet. You can pick teams and compete with other fat folks in there, and that’d be something. “Hey, sweetheart, where’s my stretch pants?” It’s League Night at Golden Corral tonight',\n",
              "  '.” I’d seen a couple get engaged at the Golden Corral. Hey, fellas, here’s a tip. If you’re gonna ask your girl to marry you at a Golden Corral, get down on two knees and do it, so she can’t kick you in the nuts. [all laughing] [clapping] I was down in Branson. They got stuff down there, buffets, holy smokes. They got an international buffet in Branson. It is crazy. They got food all the way from Memphis. Got a double-decker buffet. They got a double decker. One of the world’s largest buffets, double decker, spiral staircase. All right, that’s just what all us fat folks have been clamoring for out there, a buffet with a staircase. Oh, damn! I’m gonna get some more of them doughnut holes. “They’re upstairs.” You know what? I’m all right, I guess. I’ll be all right. I’ll stay down here, get some meatballs, put some powdered sugar on them. That’s what I’d do right there. Lot of old folks down there in Branson riding them scooters down there. I find that crazy. These folks have lost their driver’s license two decades ago, but they’re gonna go ahead and let them have motorized vehicles in a room full of pedestrians at the buffets down there. Trying to get food, they’re zipping by like it’s a drive-through. [blows raspberry] I went up to get some potato salad. It was like I was in a live Frogger game all of a sudden. You go like that. What the hell? [screams] I finally got hit head-on by some old dude trying to text and drive. He’s trying to send a crotch shot to Tinder, apparently. I was, uh… at a restaurant one time. You ever been to these restaurants, and you go to the bathroom? It can be any restaurant that you go to the bathroom, and then go take a leak in there, and they got a sign that says, “All employees must wash hands.” That scares the hell out of me right there. They need a sign to tell these folks to wash their hands? I mean, what the hell? Makes me wonder what kind of sign they got back in the kitchen we can’t see back there! Don’t snot in the coleslaw. [all laughing] Don’t drip your scrotum in the salsa. [crowd screaming in laughter] [chuckles] I know. Hey, that actually happened one time. That’s a true story. You remember that story? A waiter was mad at a customer, dipped his scrotum in the salsa! [groans] That’s why I always order the hot cheese dip. -[all laughing] -Yeah. [chuckles] That’s right. Most of your waiters aren’t that dedicated, all right? We live in a great country, though. I’ll tell you what? These people bitch about our country. This is an awesome country. We got– You realize there’s a buffet on every street corner in this country? Other people starving. You ever see that starving kid commercial? For eight cents a day, you can feed a starving child– Eight cents a day? Daggum, you can’t keep a gerbil alive for eight cents a day! Daggum, I go through 270 bucks a day, and I’m on a diet. [all laughing',\n",
              "  '] Reading an article in the paper the other day, and… fella jumped off some mountain with one of them kites, Batman kites, and it didn’t work, and he slammed into something. It killed him, and it said, “Diver dies ’cause of freak accident.” Freak acc– That ain’t a freak accident! Y-You jumped off a building with a kite on your back! That’s a dumbass accident, is what that is. A freak accident? Ain’t no freak ac– I’ll tell you what a freak accident is. You’re down there at the local, you know, stop-and-shop down there and getting gas, and unbeknownst to you, there’s two clowns in a knife fight, and one of them falls and stabs you in the face. That’s a freak accident right there, all right? [laughter and applause] [crowd cheering] Yeah, buddy! Read another article one time. This is why I don’t like polls. I see an article. They said they polled in Washington, D.C. They polled 2,500 women, said, “Now that Bill Clinton’s way older, would you sleep with Bill Clinton?” Unbelievable! 94% said, “Not again!” [all laughing] Thank you. Good night. Thank you so much! Good night. Thank you. All right, I’ll stay. I’ll stay. All right, you convinced me. I’m gonna hang out for a while. Remain seated. Stupid polls. “Well, the polls indicate–” I ain’t ever been polled. You ever been polled? I haven’t been polled. Been polled? Been polled? Been polled? There’s only one poll I ever trusted. That’s the polls I do at my shows. And I’d done one last night, and I believe this. I polled all my audience last night. 87% of them said at this point in time during my show, they want their money back. [all laughing] [woman] No! I’ve been, uh– Well, you’s one of the 13%. [all laughing] 87-13, yeah! 13% right there! Yeah! Right? I know my daggum math! [crowd cheering] [laughing] You know, I work a lot of fairs. I love working fairs. It’s awesome, ’cause I grew up in fairs! And I love fairs– What has happened to the clientele at the fairs lately, though? Holy smokes. I was up there the other day. There’s a dude walking like he’s bleeding from the nose, you know, walking like he’s got a daggum fart stuck sideways, heading down that thing down there. Looked like a Greyhound bus overturned. He came walking in, trying to get help or something. I mean, it’s unbelievable at these fairs. By the way, anybody ever ride a Greyhound bus? I used to ride them back in the early days of comedy, holy smokes! Only thing slower than a Greyhound bus is the people on the daggum bus. They’re a good value, though. I went from Sanford, Florida, all the way to Lincoln, Nebraska, one time, $49. Oh, man! 119 days! -[all laughing] -[sighs] Holy smokes! And the big selling point at the time was, “Now with more leg room.” What they needed was more head room so I could have hung myself halfway through the trip! [man] Git-R-Done! -Git-R-Done. So I won one of ’em big stuffed animals one ',\n",
              "  'time at the fair, which I hated, ’cause I had to carry it around the whole time. And I win something, and the guy goes, “What do you want?” and I said, “Well, give me that goofy-lookin’ minion right there, that little minion.” He says, “What?” I said, “That goofy lookin’ minion with the purple hat right there!” He goes, “That’s the manager!” [all laughing] You ever ride the rides at the fair? They scare the heck out of me. My little boy goes, “Daddy, can we ride the roller coaster?” “We ain’t ridin’ a roller– You do realize, son, they put that up in an hour in a parking lot, all right?” Probably got a bunch of parts left over on that daggum thing. “Remember last Christmas when I got you that bicycle and put it together “in 50 minutes, and you got on it, the wheels fell off, “and you racked your nuts, remember that whole day right there?” That’s gonna happen to you on that rollercoaster right there.” He’s like, “Come on, Daddy!” “No, we’re not doing it. That’s it!” So we’re on the roller coaster there, and, uh… Ugh! I was so mad. I almost puked on that thing. It went upside down. [groans] I get done, I go, “You didn’t tell me it went upside down.” The guy running it goes, “It’s not supposed to.” [all laughing] How about that Ferris wheel? You like that Ferris wheel? [sighs] Me, either! Oh, yeah, the Ferris wheel, that’s a lot of fun, isn’t it? Yeah. Nothing I like better in the whole world than being completely bored and terrified at the same time. [chuckles] Which, by the way, is the same thing my wife told me on our honeymoon right there, all right? [chuckles] You ever get stuck on the Ferris wheel? Oh, man! I was up there with my kids. We was stuck. They was crying, freaking out. Trying to calm ’em down. “Don’t worry, kids. We’ll be all right.” “I’m sure that guy running it with seven fingers and a pentagram tattoo, all right, “I’m sure, I’m sure he’ll have us down in no time here.” “Soon as he’s done smoking that joint, I’m sure we’ll be right down out of this deal.” Anybody ever been to the fair on Senior Day? [all chuckling] I went on Senior Day. Most popular ride on Senior Day is the ambulance on the way out of the fair. Daggum, there’s one leaving the scrambler every two minutes in there. Best part about Senior Day, though, it only lasts from 3:30 to 5:00, so that’s a good thing. They got special prizes on Senior Day. I saw an old guy bust a balloon with a dart, and he won a pair of Depends with a picture of Def Leppard on it right there. The food’s different on Senior Day. The fried foods. Anybody ever have fried Lipitor? [all laughing] They got a guy that guesses your weight at the fair. They need somebody to guess your cholesterol level in there. I had a buddy of mine used to do that. He used to try to guess people’s weight at the fair. I went with him one time, and… this girl come up there. She goes, “What do yo',\n",
              "  'u do?” He goes, “I guess people’s weight.” She goes, “How do you win?” I mean, she was a looker. You could tell. [crowd laughing] He goes, “Well, I guess your weight, and then you get on a scale.” if I’m five pounds either way, I win, you lose.” She goes, “I’m gonna do it.” He’s like, “All right. Uh, oof.” “317.” [crowd laughing] She gets on there, “Ha ha, you lose! 345!” I’m like, “He loses? Are you kiddin’ me?” “I got John Deere attachments that weigh less than you do right now.” “Congratulations. You’re blimp worthy.” [all laughing] But you can gain weight at the fair. It’s all fried, heavy– You like the– You ever eat the corn dogs at the fair? [audience clapping] Oh, yeah! -Oh, I love ’em! Holy smokes! Have you seen the size of the fair corn dogs? Holy smokes! I’m not saying they’re big, but I was eating one at the rodeo, and the horse come by and winked at me. -[crowd laughter and applaud] -[sighs] -[laughs] [man wolf-whistles] They’re good value, though. They’re only a dollar. But what they don’t tell you, it’s another $75 for ’em to come out to your house and snake your toilet, all right? They neglect to tell you that. I’ll tell you what I really hate at the fairs. The Porta Potties they got lined up there. Oh, what a disgusting, wretched stuff that is. They ought to have a midway game where you can win scented candles and fly swatters, you know what I mean? I don’t go in ’em anymore. Uh-uh! I was in a Porta Potty five months ago, and, no lie, my eyebrows just grew back last Tuesday, all right? I don’t go in them Porta Potties. When I’m at the fair, I take a plastic bag, and I pee in a ziplock plastic bag. That’s what I do. My wife’s like, “Put that away. You’re embarrassing me!” “What do you mean embarrassed? You ought to walk proudly.” It looks like I won you a goldfish over there!” The fish right there. [laughing] It’s catching on, too. My buddy walked by. “Hey, Larry, look! I’m doin’ it, too! Look at that!” I’m like, “I told you that– Uh-uh, you’re not supposed to poop in it!” “What are you doing?” Get it out of here! Get it out of here!” You ever see what some folks wear at the fair? It’s almost they ain’t got a mirror at the house. I’d seen a guy, about 326 pounds, wearing Lululemon shorts. What in the world? He bent down to pick something up, I could see his Lulu and his lemons, all right? -Daggum… [all laughing] “Get up. You’re scaring my kids. This is ridiculous.” Couple of years ago, my grandma, uh, playing bingo at the fair… won her a spa package. But to be honest, I think they gave her the wrong package. Uh, she said that she was able to tolerate the Botox… but during the Brazilian wax, she farted and blinded the attendant. [audience laughs] [scattered applause] [sighs] Lord, I apologize for that right there, and be with the starving pygmies down in New Guinea. Amen. -[mouthing] Listen, I’m sorry. I’m so',\n",
              "  'rry. [audience cheering] [audience applauds] I saw my grandma topless… two weeks ago. [sighs] That’s the last time I let her drink before a concert, I’ll tell you that much. Daggum! It was embarrassing. It was windy out, so her boobies was flying around like one of them inflatable wind dancers in front of an oil change shop. -You know what I mean? [audience laughing] It was horrible. The Oak Ridge Boys didn’t even want to do an encore after they saw that. “Thanks a lot, Grandma. Your flapping titties just cost me an encore of “giddy up oom poppa maow maow” right there, all right? [scattered applause] I’m kidding. My grandma– My grandma’s awesome. She’s actually a widower. She’s trying to– She’s trying to meet some fellas now. She’s on one of them, uh, elderly dating services. She went on the Internet, Metamucil Mingle. -She’s been on that there for a while. [audience laughs] I think she’s on medical marijuana. I ain’t sure, but… she gave us a quilt the other day made out of Taco Bell wrappers, so there’s something going on there. [audience applauds, laughs] We almost lost my granddad. He’s 93 years old. He almost passed away– We almost lost him on the toilet. He almost died on the toilet. Boy, what a way to go right there. [sighs] Can you imagine dying on the toilet? I mean, what do you say to the relatives at the wake to make ’em feel better? I mean, that’s a tough one there. “Eh, Mrs. Eggerhof, we’re…” “we’re real sorry to hear about Ed. Man, that’s… [sniffles] [sighs] “But at least he died doing what he loved. -“You know, that’s–“ [audience laughing] “We– We heard he fought ’til the bitter end, and that’s the thing.” “He– He wasn’t a quitter, so he got it out.” “We’re excited, and that’s nice. We’re gonna light a match tonight and remember him at midnight, and, hopefully…” [scattered laughter, applause] I read a story one time. A fella got bit by a snake sitting on the toilet. He got interviewed. He said, “First thing I thought was I need to call animal control.” -That’s the first thing he thought? -[scattered laughter] If I got bit by something, the first thing I’d think is, “What the hell did I eat last night?” [audience chuckles] “Daggum. My food’s circling back on me here.” [audience laughing] We almost lost my grandpa. He sat on one of ’em power flush toilets. You ever seen them energy-savers? You flush it. There’s a– [mimics flushing] It goes like that? I mean, if you sit on it and flush, it’ll put a hickey on your hind end. I guarantee you. It will. But he sat on there– [mimics flush] Flushed it. Boom! Left nut down the drain. I ain’t kiddin’ with ya. True story! I wish it wasn’t, but that’s a true story. [laughing] I’m trying to help him out. I’m trying to yank him off that thing right here. It’s stuck in that little tube hole in there. [grunting] It’s like daggum Stretch Armstrong. Like… [grunting] And finally–',\n",
              "  \" [sputters] It comes lose, slow motion, right in my daggum head. [mimics slow-motion yell] It hits me. [mimics collision] It was like them little knocker balls. You ever seen them little knocker balls? “Boo! Boo! Boo! Boo! Boo!” Bloodied my daggum nose. [audience chuckling] My wife’s like, “What’s going on in here?” [sighs] “His twig and berries went MMA on me, is what happened in here. I have had it.” [sighs] I love him. My grandpa, an alcoholic. We had a family reunion here a while back. We rarely get ’em, but we finally got everybody paroled at the same time, -so we were able to… -[audience laughs] My family’s– [sighs] What in the world! Don’t even wanna talk about ’em sometimes. My brother, he’s all stressed out now ’cause he’s been reading the papers. He thinks he’s gonna lose his job to a robot. I didn’t have the heart to tell him, if he look in his wife’s drawer, he’s already lost his job. [audience laughs, applauds] [whistling] It’s true. It’s true. My sister-in-law, she’s about 4’10”, 290 lbs. She used to model decoy stumps down there at Cabela’s many years ago. She had her stomach stapled last week. Nothing medically. She was at work and accidentally stapled some papers to her stomach there. But my grandpa’s an alcoholic. He’s drunk at the reunion. I said, “Grandpa, why do you drink so much?” He said, “Look around. I’m responsible for all this.” [audience laughs, applauds] [whistling] [Larry chuckles] My cousin hates Halloween. He hates Halloween, boy. I don’t mind Halloween. Out cat died two days before Halloween this year so we left him in the yard for extra decoration for the kids. [audience laughs] Do you dress up for Halloween? [audience members] Yeah! I did this year. My buddy, I wanted to help him out. He’s got a health food business he’s starting, a little gym in there, so I dressed up– Put on a dress and went as a “trans-fat.” [audience laughing] [whistling, cheering] [sighs] I always go with my kids trick or treatin’. You know, but here’s the problem. I’m very flattered people dress like me when they trick or treat. But it’s weird when I go, ’cause I’m just hanging out with my kids! They knock on the door, people are like, “Oh, look, little Batman, little Superman.” Ah! Larry the Cable Guy! That’s a good costume!” Then I always hear somebody from the back of the room. “Who is it?” “He’s dressed like Larry the Cable Guy.” Then I hear, “Ugh! That guy sucks!” [audience laughs] What the hell? Next time, I’m gonna go as Foxworthy, all right? How’s that? -That’s right. [chuckles] -[whistling] -I don’t care if anybody thinks he sucks. [whistling continues] [groans] Ugh! Anyway, my cousin hates Halloween. Hates it. He says to me, “I am so sick and tired of Halloween.” “I’m trying to watch the daggum TV show.” “‘Trick or treat?’ Every two minute– ‘Trick or treat.'” Gotta get up and give them candy.” I’m like… “[\",\n",
              "  'sighs] Calm down. [chuckles] Buddy, you ain’t gotta participate.” There’s ways you can get around the Halloween and kids.” You know what he did? Went down and registered as a sex offender. [audience laughing] I’m like, “You do know all you gotta do is turn your porch light off, right?” [laughing] You do know that?” He goes, “You think I’ve done something stupid?” “Yeah, I think you’ve done something stupid!” You’re the Sheriff, for heaven’s sake!” -[mouthing indistinctly] [audience laughing] [scattered applause] I always check my kids’ candy for poisons and razor blades. “Hold on, kids. You can’t eat that yet.” “I gotta check ’em for poisons and razor blades.” They come down later on. “Where’s all our candy?” “We live in a pretty bad neighborhood. I’ll be honest with ya.” “I swear we’re gonna move next year. I promise that.” “They ruined everything?” “No, not everything.” “They didn’t touch that box of raisins in there, but they…” Tell you what. Them Butterfingers, they was riddled with poison in there.” [audience laughs] I can’t eat like that no more. It sucks getting fat! Man, I’m trying to lose some weight. I gotta do something. It’s ridiculous! Ugh! I got on the trampoline the other day with my kids. I had two jumps, had to get off! I wasn’t tired or nothing. I had to get a ladder to get my boy out of a tree. [audience laughs] And it stinks, gettin’ older and fatter! And I used to be something back in the day, boys. I used to be something! I did. I used to run cross-country. You Google it. I think I still hold the state record for taking the most shits in the woods. [audience laughs] But I’m on a diet now. I’m eating nothing but Fruit Loops. But my wife has me on a… [audience laughs] My wife has me on a diet now where I can have one cheat day. So I can have a hamburger with the cheese and the bun… one day a week. [quickly] Or anytime I drive by a fast-food restaurant when she’s not with me in the car. -All right, not there. -[audience laughing] [loud whistle] [normally] She’s a stickler, too, I tell you what. She’d be up there sleeping, 2:30 in the morning. Dog go down there and bark at the door for ten minutes, she don’t hear nothing. She’s racked out. I gotta go down there and let the dog out. So next day, I go down. I’m kinda hungry. I pour a little– little bowl of Cap’n Crunch down there. I hear, “Get out of the Cap’n Crunch!” [audience laughing] “What the hell? I should have barked when I poured that Cap’n Crunch in there, is what I should’ve done. It sucks gettin’ old and fat, I’ll tell you. I remember when my beard turned white, my– my wife was, like, trying to comfort me. “Oh, that’s okay, honey. I like somebody with a little salt and pepper in their beard.” Made me feel a little better. Then she goes, “It’s the corn in your teeth that’s disgusting.” -All right? [audience laughs] I was gonna say broccoli, but n',\n",
              "  'one of y’all believe I eat broccoli. -All right, so I ain’t saying that. [audience laughing] [sighs] Here’s the thing about getting older. You start losing your daggum memory. I can’t– I have a hard time remembering stuff now. It’s so frustrating. Have you ever left your groceries on the roof of your car? Yeah? For three weeks? -You ever did that? [audience laughing] I’m a hypochondriac. I always think I’m dying of something. I’m freaking out. Had a red blotch right there one time for a week, it’s freaking me out. So I go get a biopsy on it. Tested positive for picante sauce. [audience laughing] [sighs] Idiot! Cost me $1,000 to do that! Good news is, he wrote me a prescription for napkins, so that was pretty good, I guess. I always think I’m dying. Don’t ever look nothing up on the Internet, ’cause it ain’t good. It’s always lupus or Lou Gehrig’s, that’s what it is, one of them two. I think I got both of them damn diseases. Seen a commercial the other day for breast implant leakage. I had every damn symptom of a breast implant leakage in there. These stupid things. I ain’t kidding with you. Don’t ever look it up. It’s always lupus. Except for one time I had a lump right here. Honest. “What in the hell?” I look it up. “Ah, brain cancer That’s–“ [audience laughs] “That’s it for me. I’m a dead man. I got brain cancer.” You never learn nothing on the Internet, medically, looking it up. Except one time, I did. I found out that jock itch is also the name of a porn star in France. [laughing] And what is it about getting in your mid-50s, your big toe nail’s like a manhole cover all of a sudden? Holy smokes! I went to clip it the other day, the pin popped out of the clipper system in there. Holy smokes! Finally, I chip it off, hits my kid in the head, knocks him out, he’s bleeding from the eyeball. [audience laughing] I hate the waiting room, too, the walk-in clinic. Holy smokes, nobody’s got any manners in there, you know. Everybody’s sitting in there, hawking, hacking, coughing, farting, burping, belching– What the heck? Then you go see the nurse, “What are you here to see the doctor for?” “Well, it was a chest cold. Now I think I got hepatitis after being in there and…” Gotta go in there and wait ten hours for something. I could walk in there on bloody nubs, pulling my legs in a wagon in there… gotta sit for six hours. I ain’t sitting nowhere over an hour if I… ain’t got a wine list or something in there. [audience chuckling] Serve some beer. Boy, that’d be a game changer right there, wouldn’t it? Walk-in clinics start serving wine? [chuckles] “Excuse me, nurse. What wine do you recommend that goes with my itchy butthole?” [audience laughing] “Maybe a Boone’s Farm? Maybe a cherry wine or something like that or…” Then I finally get in to see the doctor, I got to wait on him in his room for another 45 minutes. Freezing cold, I’m i',\n",

Yeah! -[whistling] Then he comes in there, and he looks at me. He looks around me. He looks in me. He lifts stuff up. He sighs a couple of times. It’s like a bad episode of Storage Wars every time I go to the doctor. [audience laughs] Then I spend all that money, waste all that time. You know what his diagnosis was? “You’re too fat.” [audience chuckles] Yeah, no kiddin’. What the hell? I could’ve stayed at home, and my wife’d tell me that for free. He’s like, “What are you gonna do about it?” “I don’t know. Hang out with people fatter than me, I guess.” Maybe take a selfie next to a cement mixer or something.” He’s like, “Well, you need to eat better. What did you eat last week?” “I don’t know. Go get my T-shirt.” [audience laughs] He says, “I want you to join a gym.” I ain’t joining a gym. Last time I was down there, I left a skid mark on the yoga mat. I ain’t going down to that gym. [audience laughing] He goes, “Well, get on a treadmill then. “Find a treadmill. Get on it. But start slow, and ease into it.” I don’t want you to have a heart attack.” Oh, that’s comforting right there. That’s when you know you’re a fat-ass right there. When cardiovascular exercise is like Russian roulette all of a sudden. “Honey, how much time you doing on the treadmill?” “I don’t know. Hopefully 30 minutes. I ain’t sure, all right?” “How’d he die?” “Sweatin’ to the oldies.” Weirdest thing I ever seen.” My buddy’s all mad at his doctor, ’cause he’s seen him driving a brand-new Mercedes-Benz. That’s good. Means you got a good doctor. I want my doctor to have a brand-new Mercedes-Benz. I don’t want to be a hour and a half away from open-heart surgery, my doctor show up in a ’78 Plymouth. You know, the door open up, a bunch of Pringles cans come falling out of the thing. [audience laughing] It’s like, “He thinks he’s better than me.” He is better than you. He’s a doctor. You’re a bouncer-slash-cook down there at Grits and Tits. I will say, though, and I hate admitting this, but sometimes I do think… that a doctor will talk you into a real expensive surgery just ’cause it’s more money. And I never used to think that way ’til after my hysterectomy, but… [audience laughing] I went and had a colonoscopy done. Boy, you ought to see the looks of the folks in that place. The looks on their faces, sittin’ in there, waiting on a colon– [chuckles] They all had that look like Wile E. Coyote seconds before he got hit by that anvil, you know what I mean? There was actually a guy sitting in a corner, holding up a sign that said, “Yikes.” They’re all for– And nobody’s nice to you. That’s the thing. I mean, not even the staff is treating you nice. And you know what’s fi’ing to happen. What in the hell? I mean, even Jif',\n",
              "  'fy Lube puts out coffee and donuts. [audience laughing] And if I’m gonna go up there and they’re gonna start shoving stuff up my hind end, the least they could do is put out some bear claws. I was worried about that one. I said, “Oh, I gotta get a colonoscopy.” My wife’s like, “What are you worried about?” “Because they gonna put a camera up my hind end.” She goes, “Well, your head’s been up there eight months.” [audience laughing] All right, you do know you’re not funny, right? Worst part of the colonoscopy is the night before when you gotta drink the “go juice.” Holy smokes! I called waste management to give ’em a heads-up is what I did. “Hey, you better get some extra knob turners down there, ’cause… you’re fi’ing to have a donnybrook headed your way in five minutes.” Well, I was in there. I was reading a medical journal thing they had on the stuff they could do and what they– you know, all the operations they can do. Boy, what a time to be alive. I’d rather have a surgery now than 50 years ago. But some of the stuff they do– I read this article. They said they can now start to grow female reproductive organs in petri dishes for women that’s born with reproductive deformities. Ain’t that something? Boy… Like to be a kid now and get that chemistry set, I’ll tell you that much. Holy smokes. Ho. “Hey, where’s Larry at?” “Uh, he’s in the basement hoeing his vagina garden down there.” -[chuckles] That’s right. [audience laughing, clapping] Tell you what. Git-R-Done. That’s right. Yeah, they come up with a Twinkie tree, I’d never leave the house, I guarantee you. I guarantee you that. [audience laughing] I was in there. There was a woman breast-feeding in there, which is fine, that’s what you do. But if I’m being honest with you, the kid had to be four years old. [audience laughing] Isn’t that weird? [woman in audience] Yeah. I mean, I ain’t a woman. I don’t know, but four seems a little weird to me. I mean, I think when you’re breast-feeding, when the kid starts to incorporate salt shakers and a lime, you know what I mean? [chuckles] When he’s like, “Give me a squirt for my coffee,” maybe he’s a little too old for that, you know, maybe. Maybe it’s time to get him on the, uh, you know, titty milk 12-step program there in your area. I remember when we had kids, my wife used to have a breast pump, and she’d pump bottles. One time, she said, “Hey… you wanna taste that?” [chuckles] No. [audience laughing] Ha. She’s like, “Why? It’s better for you than cow’s milk.” [chuckling] Yeah, all right, whatev– Look, I’ve been on cow’s milk for some 50-odd years. I’m doing pretty good, all right. [chuckles] Only people I’ve ever seen drink your milk poop their pants eight times a day, all right, so… -[chuckles] [audience cheers] Ha. Ha. Yeah.

[audience laughing] My neighbor’s got a newborn baby. And, uh, he fell in the toilet the other day, so… they got him sleeping in a bag of rice this weekend. [audience laughing] I got kids. I love my kids so much, but I tell you what, it’s unbelievable… how the Lord can create life. I mean, it’s unbelievable. You just see that little baby’s head pop out, you whole life is transformed and changed, and you just love it so much, and you cry, you know. And then, ten years later, that same thing, you wanna slap the living piss out of it, you know what I mean? It’s unbelievable, the whole different– I remember when my little boy was born. I was scared to hit a speed bump leaving the hospital for fear his head would go like that and crack open or somethin’. Here I am ten years later, driving down the interstate trying to drive, trying to get the perfect whack on the middle of his frickin’ head. And, uh, my wife’s like, “Be careful, you’re gonna crash.” I don’t give a shit. I’ll kill everybody in this car right now, all right? I could care less. I’ve had it with him right now. [audience hooting] It’s ridiculous. [audience hooting, whistling, clapping] Yeah, the Pope came out and said, “Married couples should have more kids.” That’s easy for him to say. Daggum Pope ain’t got no kids. How ’bout I drop my kids off at the Vatican for a couple of hours? How’s that sound? Yeah, see if they can get grape jelly out of the Pope hat, all right? [audience laughing] That’s why I never understood kidnapping. Really? You wanna put up with this bullshit? Are you kiddin’ me? Holy– You kidnap my kids, they’d be back on the porch in two days with an apology note strapped to the side of them. [audience hooting] Oh, but I love ’em. I don’t care what age it is, you put up with– I love ’em so much, I tell you. You know, I was gonna home school my kids, and them my wife reminded me, uh, we’re idiots. [audience laughing] [Larry chuckling] [chuckles] Hey, I was home schooled, and I-I loved it. I finished, uh, second in my class. [audience laughing] [chuckles] It wasn’t until two years ago, my mom told me that she’d made the dog valedictorian. -I don’t know what it is. [audience laughing] I worry about my kids. Oh, they’re so sweet. My little girl’s such a sweetie, and my little boy’s got a kind heart. And I just worry about bullies in sch– Oh. You know, I was bullied by a fourth grader one time, and, oh, I hated every minute of it. So I finally– I went home and told my wife she’s gotta go pick the kids up, ’cause I can’t handle it down there no more. Hey, you laugh. There’s some big-ass fourth graders out there. I mean, this girl, she wasn’t small. I’ll guarantee you that much. Re',\n",
              "  'membered Father’s Day and my kids. By the way, Father’s Day is the biggest piece of crap holiday they got out there. That’s where your wife and kids take your money and buy you crap you didn’t want to begin with. All right? But my kids, they’re so sweet. They drew a picture of me. and put “We love you, Daddy” on it. And– Which is awesome. And I felt so bad, because instead of me going, “Man, I love my kids. This is–” The only thing I could think… when they gave it to me was… “I’m not that fat, am I?” [audience laughing] And it bugged me, and I told them, “Kids, I like the picture, but I’m not that fat.” They’re like, “Yeah, you are.” I’m like, “No, I’m not.” Yeah, so they took the picture and held it up to my cellphone, and it unlocked it. [audience laughing] Took a family vacation. Everybody wants to go canoeing, which I didn’t wanna do. Canoeing’s an old Indian word that means “butt blisters.” [audience laughing] Yeah, canoeing’s a lot of fun when you’re a fat guy. Yeah, that’s a lot of fun right there. My little boy’s in the front. I’m in the back. Going down the river for five miles, popping a wheelie, going in circles. Got a catfish stuck to my nipple. I can’t get it off of there. He’s like, “Why do I gotta wear a life jacket?” Because if this thing tips over, it’ll keep you alive long enough for me to save the Kentucky Fried Chicken over there, all right? [audience laughing] You know what the difference between canoeing with your wife and canoeing with your little boy is? [man] What? When you’re done canoeing, your little boy is still talking to you. [audience laughing] [chuckling] My wife’s– My wife’s 13 years younger than me. -[hooting] -Git-R-Done. I’ll never forget the preacher’s words. “I now pronounce you husband and incoming freshman.” You know who doesn’t like it when you marry younger women? Older women. [chuckles] Not all of them. Just her mom and her aunt. Here’s the bad thing about being married to somebody younger than you. They’re already ready to go out and start doing stuff you’re sick and tired of doing. You know? Like… leaving the house. [audience laughing] Fourth of July, she’s like, “Let’s go see the fireworks display.” “All right. What channel is it on? I’ll be down in a minute.” I know my wife loves me, though, ’cause she married me looking like this. [chuckles] The good thing about marrying somebody that looks like this is there ain’t a lot to drop-off on the years to go by. You know, It’s like buying a Kia, you know? Sure, it’s a Kia, but it ain’t gonna get no shittier than that. All right? [audience laughing] People said to me, “You know, your wife only married you ’cause you’re famous.” And I asked her. I said, “Did you marry me ’cause I’m famous?” She said, “No. I married you ’cause you’re rich.” [chuckles] [audience laughing] What? I’m just kidding. I did ask her, though. I said, “Did you ',\n",
              "  'marry me ’cause I got money?” She goes, “No. It’s our money.” [audience laughing] My wife… uh, I love her so much. She goes to the spa every now and then. And I can’t ever figure the spa out. I go, “Why do you go the the spa all the time?” “‘Cause I like to sit in there and soak and think about stuff and relax.” “Well, we got a tub at the house. Can’t you soak in the tub at the house?” She goes, “Yeah, but at the spa, you don’t sit on the toilet and stare at me.” [audience laughing] My wife is sexy, too, boy. She likes to talk when we make love. That’s sexy right there. -[audience member hoots] -Oh, I love that. Make love every day. She says stuff like, uh, “You okay?” [audience laughing] “Why’s your face red?” “Blink twice if you can hear me.” I’m like, “Get off my leg. Oh, my chest. Ah, my chest. Get off. Get off.” Making love to my wife is like having a stroke with a happy ending. [audience laughing] I feel bad for her, too, ’cause I’m not handy around the house. [chuckles] I’m a comedian, you know? One time, I put up a towel rack. It fell off seven times. So she went and got a stud finder, and he put it up. I went shopping with her one time. And I hate this. Do I– “Does this make me look fat”? I hate that. I don’t know. Look what I’m wearing. Do you think I’m a fashion plate right here? “Honey, does this– Do I look fat in this?” “I don’t know. How much is it?” I’ll tell you if you look fat in it or not.” $400? [imitates pig squealing] [audience cheering] [Larry chuckling] Yeah. Anybody see the movie Cars? -[audience whistling, cheering] -All right, everybody seen that? That’s right. That’s how I’m able to afford these fancy britches right here. -[man] Yeah. -[Larry chuckling] I got a funny story to tell you about that. Here’s how I got that part. John Lasseter told me that I didn’t have to audition or nothing. He said he’d been to 200 celebrities, 150 voice-over artists. He didn’t have any clue. One day left, picked up Blue Collar Comedy CD. He heard my voice. Said, “That’s my tow truck. Get him on the phone.” [chuckles] That’s how I got the job. -It’s the craziest thing ever. -[audience cheering] I was so thankful. I’m not kidding. [whistling from audience] So thankful. So I go out there, and I’m nervous. I go out there. I’m nervous. It’s John Lasseter and Pixar, and he shows me around, and he puts me in this booth, and there’s the script, and he says, “All right. Just wanna let you know that, uh… “when we do these voices, I might, uh… “have you do the same voice, “same line, 12 times, but don’t think you’re doing bad.” We just get a lot of takes.” And then I said, “Okay, well how do you want– “How is Mater? Is he, kind of, a fast talker?” He goes, “What do you mean?” I go, “Well, just, I don’t know.” He goes, “He’s you. You’re Mater.” I said, ‘Well, yeah, but–” “No, just be you.” I’m like, “All right.” So my first li',\n",
              "  \"ne was, “My name is Mater, like ‘Tuh-Mater’ without the ‘Tuh'”. So he did his line and he pointed at me, and I just went, “My name is Mater, like ‘Tuh-Mater’ without the ‘Tuh'”. And he started laughing and said, “All right, we got it.” [audience cheering] [Larry chuckling] Yeah, right? [chuckles] I think he might have done one more, and that was it, and– So now we do the whole movie. It was awesome. Everybody’s great. Six years later, we’re on the Fantasy Cruise, of Disney’s Fantasy ship. And it’s the very first time it ever went out there, and they’re all there, all the Disney folks, the Pixar folks. I did a show in the showroom and… and I thought this was the weirdest request, but I did it. John Lasseter asked me to go up and take the ship’s microphone and make a ship’s announcement. It goes all over the ship. And then, once I’m done as Mater telling everybody thanks for coming on the ship, then have Mater introduce you, and you tell everybody thanks for coming to your show. And I thought, “Well, that’s kind of weird, but… [chuckles] I’ll go ahead and do it.” And we laugh every time we think about it, but it’s the actual… uh, message I did on the boat. This is what it sounded like. “Hey, everybody. This is Mater, like ‘Tuh-Mater’ without the ‘Tuh.'” “Boy, I tell you what, I’m happier than a tornado in a trailer park “that you come on this Fantasy Cruise, and shoot, daggum, “if you ever get to Radiator Springs, “you and me will do us some backward driving.” “All right, then, don’t forget. You and me, we is best friends.” “Now here’s my buddy, Larry the Cable Guy, to say something to you.” Hey, everybody. This is Larry, the Cable Guy.” [audience laughing] Same voice! God bless you guys. Thank you so much… for an awesome night tonight. I hope you enjoyed everything, and Git-R-Done! [audience cheering] [Larry] Thank you so much. Thank you.

Thank you. Thank you. All right, we only have an hour. (audience laughing) Have I offended anybody yet? We, it’ll happen. It happens fast! We have gotten soft. We have gotten soft. Watch this. What are you allergic to? Nothing! Nothing! Gluten wouldn’t take down our generation. (audience laughing) We’re not allergic to things like peanuts. You know why? Our parents made us eat peanuts. (audience laughing) They made us eat peanuts until we weren’t allergic to peanuts. (audience applauding) And if our throat started to close up, you know how they opened it up? They shoved more peanuts down it! (audience laughing) I’m not allergic to germs. Watch this. Shake my hand. Look at that, that’s how you shake a hand. I don’t care about ger, listen. ',\n",
              "  'I’m starting to really hate people. Let me start out with that. I went to shake a guy’s hand the other day. He goes, “Oh no-no-no-no-no-no. I just washed.” (audience laughing) That’s when I want to shake your hand! (audience applauding) Not when it’s filthy. “Oh oh good timing. I, I was about to wash. Now I can fit another shake in.” Do you, do you see how crazy it’s gotten? I was raised on germs, okay? Germs are good for you. I didn’t wash my hands until I was 22! (audience laughing) In my family, there were five people, one sink, one hand towel. Five people shared one hand towel that never dried. (audience laughing) It’s still wet. When I got home, it’s still wet from 1989. (audience applauding) And I just found out recently that none of us ever touched the front of the towel, ’cause that’s where we thought everybody else was touching. (audience laughing) We all snuck around back. Turns out that’s where the polio, scabies, hand-foot, mouth, head, shoulders, knees and toes, knees and toes disease was hangin’ out! We didn’t have antibacterial soap when I was a kid. No! The old germs killed the new germs! (audience laughing) (audience applauding) We didn’t have this little wussy pump soap that you guys, can you say “Wussy”? Can you say “Wussy”? I don’t wanna upset the little millennial word police! (audience laughing) “Orny said, “Wussy’! Orny said, “Wussy’!” How about these people on Twitter that have five followers. Why don’t you just text everybody you know? (audience laughing) (audience applauding) I like germs. Germs make you stronger! We didn’t even have pump soap. We had a bar of soap. We had a bar of soap that lasted so long, it rusted, it rusted! It would crack and rust, and in the cracks there were rivers of mud. This is what you used to wash your hands. I have an immunity. I shake hands, I don’t care. I grew up in a time, you’re not gonna believe, how old are you? Me? No, the kid, what is this? What, how old are you? 12. 12! (laughing) That’s adorable. Look at him. Let me tell ya something. What’s your name? Hudson. Hudson? (audience laughing) Hudson You not gonna believe this. I grew up in a time, Hudson, when salad bars, there was no glass! (audience laughing) (audience applauding) There was nothing in between you and the lettuce! It was like the Wild West! People got right up in it! You watched them. You watched people like, ptuh! Ptuh! They spit all over. They spit all over it, Hudson, and you ate it! You ate it! (audience applauding) That was the price you paid for unlimited lettuce! (audience laughing) (audience applauding) Now you can’t get near it. The salad bar, it’s like they got that glass up. You gotta, you gotta lean in against the glass. You can’t get near the lettuce, but your face is licking, it’s disgusting, the, “I’m going in for the baby corn! Does anybody want the, hold my foot! Hold my foot!” I’m in a level two yoga move, trying to get the baby corn! You know, we used to touch ',\n",
              "  'door handles in the bathroom? (audience laughing) Remember that? Wasn’t so long ago! Then all of a sudden everybody started to take a paper towel, like, like they committed a crime and they’re wiping prints. (audience laughing) Now we got a problem, right, ’cause the eco-freako people, have taken away the paper towels. They’re making us stick our hands into this, Dyson, hand kidnap, it’s dangerous! It’s dangerous, it, it throws your hand around at 500 miles per hour. It’s narrow and you, and you don’t want to touch the sides, so it’s, it’s like that, the game “Operation.” It’s like, (imitating buzzer) shit! I touched the side! Now I gotta wash ’em again. I got it this time. (imitating buzzer) Damn it! And you still don’t want to touch the door handle, right? So now, now you gotta hang out in the bathroom like you’re a creep! Waiting for somebody to come in, and then slide by ’em like a crab, like a, some sort of military operation, like I’m, I’m doing CrossFit exercises in the bathroom! (audience laughing) This is so, if you have to catch up, it’s okay. (audience laughing) (woman laughing) Get her closer to a microphone. This is the world we, (audience laughing) we have gotten too soft. We have gotten too soft. (audience laughing) Now I’ve lost my place. (audience laughing) (audience applauding) I just want to make sure we get it all. Well, you don’t have to zoom in on the list, do ya? (audience laughing) Can we make this look spontaneous? (audience applauding) You can’t get me sick! You can’t get me sick! We didn’t have bottles of water when I was a kid. Filtered water? That’s what your kidneys are for! (audience laughing) (audience applauding) We drank out of a hose! (crowd cheering) And it wasn’t even our hose. (audience laughing) We went up to some house we didn’t even know, and we just turned on the hose and dirt flew out and spider eggs and, lead. Lead runs through my veins! We had to drink out of a hose because we weren’t allowed inside of the house until five p.m. (audience laughing) (audience applauding) I don’t know what the parents were doing till five p.m. ‘Cause we weren’t allowed inside of the house, until five p.m. Our parents, every day, they said, “Get lost! Come back at five.” And if we didn’t come back, you know what they did? They had another kid! (audience laughing) (audience applauding) They didn’t know where we were all day! I was with my friend Sean. We were biking. He got hit by a car! We then sat outside of his house until five p.m. (audience laughing) (audience applauding) Until we were allowed in. We told his parents and then they stitched him up. (audience laughing) We have gotten soft. We have gotten soft, Hudson. I don’t even know if you’re a millennial or if you’re, if you’re post a problem of the millennial. (audience laughing) But these millennials are out here, Where are people in their 20s? (crowd cheering) The most annoying people in our society, these, these, look at ’em',\n",
              "  '. Look at ’em! Look at this guy right here. No, look at you. Yes, you. How old are you? 27. You are dumb! You are dumb! (audience laughing) He’s so dumb, he’s laughing while I’m calling him dumb. (audience laughing) I’m kidding. What is your name, buddy? My name is Perry. erry, what a masculine name. (audience laughing) Let me tell ya somethin’, Perry. Your generation came onto our planet, and you ruined it! You changed too much. I mean, they’re out there right now judging me, on a criteria I did not grow up with. (audience laughing) I don’t even know what gender I am anymore! (audience laughing) (audience applauding) I mean, I’m not being flip, there’s a lot of new choices, and I haven’t done all the research, you know. Maybe I fit into something else, and I’m fine with that. I’m ready for a change. Millennials have taken away all the fun. It’s not fun anymore, do you realize that? Everything’s gotta be equal for you guys. Everything’s gotta be eq, can’t be a man in bed, can ya? What’s, what’s the fun talk for a millennial guy like? You’re with a girl like, “Are you my little equal? Who’s my, (audience applauding) who’s my little equal? Who’s my strong, independent?” Get that guy laughing right there! Get it on him! Look at him! I haven’t had an erection since the millennials took over. (audience laughing) You have to have sex on the side so nobody’s in a power position. (audience laughing) (audience applauding) These millennials came onto our planet. You changed the way we sneeze. For thousands of years, (imitating sneezing) this was fine. (audience laughing) This, this is bullshit! (audience laughing) (audience applauding) This is dumb. This makes no sense at all. The hand was made for sneezing. This is a perfect vessel. This, ricochets back into your face. I got stuck in there one time. It doesn’t work. I wash my hands several times a day. I’ve never washed this. (audience laughing) (audience applauding) I’ve never seen somebody go, “I just.” go into a public restroom, “I, I, I just, I just sneezed into my,” there’s not even a name for this, “my, my millennial pit. I just sneezed into my…” (audience laughing) (audience applauding) They’re so sensitive and they all come preinstalled with ADD. (audience laughing) They all have ADD and they love to tell ya. “I have ADD!” I’m like, “You’re lucky to have ADD.” In this day and age, with all these distractions, Can you imagine having ADD in the 1600s? (audience laughing) Maybe a horse went by every four hours. They’re out sitting, they’re churning the butter. “This, this, this sucks! I’ve got, I’ve got a disorder, something.” Something distract me. What was that, a leaf? No, back to this, this.” I’m so glad I grew up before social media. I, I really, I couldn’t handle that in high school. Ooh, ooh. (audience applauding) I feel bad for the young people. I mean, you know, In high school, I, I suspected I was a loser. Now, now it would be digitally confirmed, you ',\n",
              "  'know? I can handle it as an adult, you know what I mean? It’s like, hey, if it wasn’t for social media, I wouldn’t know how much stuff I wasn’t being invited to. (audience laughing) They’re too sensitive. Everybody’s gotta just chill out, chill out. We’ve lost our minds. And I’m not talking about the gluten people. (audience laughing) I have been going after the gluten people now for 10 years, for 10 years. People that have been watching me for the last 10 years know I was on top of this, this fad diet back when we thought it was called “glutton.” Back when we thought it was called “glutton.” (audience applauding) It’s a marketing scam to get you to buy some products. Now, I know some people actually have, okay, so I know it. Don’t, don’t, don’t go after me on social media. (audience laughing) I know some people actually have, you know, ’cause they come up to me after shows. They’re, they’re angry. They’ll come up and they’ll go, “Um, I don’t think it’s funny that you joke about cisiasics disease.” (audience laughing) Why’s everybody laughing? Ciliastic disease kills millions of… All I’m saying is, if it was real, I’d know how to pronounce it. That’s what I’m saying. (audience laughing) (audience applauding) All I’m saying is we’ve been on this planet for 200,000 years. In the last, 10, we all discovered we can’t eat wheat? It’s bullshit. It’s bullshit! It’s bullshit! (audience applauding) (crowd cheering) Do you know that sometimes if I eat a walnut, my tongue gets a little itchy? (audience laughing) I’ve never told anybody this. (audience laughing) (audience applauding) I just avoid walnuts. I had to Google how long we’ve been on the planet for. Did you know the answer? Yeah. Took me three days, ’cause I put in Google, “How long, ” The first thing it suggested was “boil corn.” (audience laughing) I’d like to know that. I didn’t know there was a recipe. I’ve been guessing my whole life. I just throw the corn into a pot and every few minutes I yell out, “Do you think the corn is ready?” So now I’m on YouTube watching videos, on how to boil corn. (audience laughing) People are making videos on how to boil corn. I’m leaving comments. “Couldn’t stop watching your video on how to boil corn. Riveting! Watched all 12 minutes even though it only takes eight to boil corn.” (audience laughing) They’re making videos on how to boil corn. There are some real losers in this world! (audience laughing) I’m telling you, I’m telling you, I’ve been after this. I don’t like fad diets. I don’t like, like the, the new ones, like the Paleo diet. Do you know what that is? Yeah. Yeah. You eat, you eat whatever the caveman ate. Well, that makes a lot of sense, since they all died when they were 12. (audience laughing) (audience applauding) These idiots are like, “I’m gonna eat like a caveman. I’m gonna have it delivered, just like the caveman did.” (audience laughing) And how do we even know the caveman was skinny? By the pictures t',\n",
              "  'hey drew of themselves on the wall? I’ve never taken a fat picture of myself. I know the skinny angle. (audience laughing) (audience applauding) You don’t think the caveman was deleting the fat caveman self, cave selfie sketch things? You don’t… I don’t like fad anything. Now there’s something called Prevagen. Do you know what this is? It’s a supplement for memory loss and it’s an ingredient they recently discovered in jellyfish. Because when you think memory, you think jellyfish! (audience laughing) These things beach themselves every single day. And they can’t find the ocean and it’s right behind them. Going, (imitating whooshing). This is how ridiculous we’ve gotten. We’ve gotten ridiculous. I was thrown off of a TV station in Portland, Oregon, because I was making fun of gluten. (audience laughing) I was in Portland, Oregon, and I was on a TV station, and I said, “Gluten doesn’t exist.” And the anchor got really angry. She goes, “Yes, it does!” (audience laughing) I’m like, well, it scared me. I’m like, “Well, what, what, what proof do you,” By the way, this is in December. Just so you know for historical purposes. (audience laughing) I go, “What, what proof do you have?” She said, “Because we have an entire section in the store.” (audience laughing) And I said, “Well, so does Santa Claus.” (audience laughing) (audience applauding) “Doesn’t make him real.” And they threw me off. They were, they got that angry. People were commenting on their Facebook page so fast, they threw me off. And I thought, “Well, that’s it. Who, who cares? It’s Portland, who cares?” (audience laughing) “Nobody’s gonna ever hear about it.” And then about four months ago, I was, in North Carolina. Yeah. Are you from North Carolina? (chuckling) (audience laughing) By the way, good luck getting unsweetened iced tea in North Carolina. (audience laughing) I should have just stood up in the restaurant and yelled, “Who won the Civil War? (audience laughing) Give me a cup of We Won unsweetened, please.” I’m in North Carolina, a guy comes up to me in the street and he said, “Is it true you don’t believe in Santa Claus?” (audience laughing) I go, “That’s a weird to thing ask an adult in June.” (audience laughing) I said, “Why are you asking me that?” And he said, “Because I read a story about how you were kicked off of a TV station in Portland on your Wikipedia page.” (audience laughing) And that’s when I realized one of these millennials told on me! (audience applauding) So I went to my Wikipedia page and, I printed it out to show you tonight. (audience laughing) I know the young people laugh. Like, at a show once, somebody yelled out, they go, “That’s cute. You still print stuff?” (audience laughing) Yeah, I’m in my 40s, I still print stuff. You know what else I do? I make plans a week in advance and I keep ’em. (audience laughing) (audience applauding) You know what else I do? When I take somebody’s picture, I count to three. (audience l',\n",
              "  'aughing) Young people just hold up the camera and then they walk away. I’m like, “I, I thought you wanted a picture.” They’re like, “I got 48.” I’m like, “Where was I for that?” Here’s my actual Wikipedia page. This is my actual Wikipedia page. And by the way, I’ve been banned from making changes to my own page. (audience laughing) I would change something, they go, “What’s your source?” I’m like, “It’s me.” (audience laughing) “On December 10, 2016, Orny caused controversy on a local Portland, Oregon, TV show by implying Santa Claus was not real.” (audience laughing) (audience applauding) Now, I didn’t imply it, I said it, but I’ve been banned from making changes. Here are the actual comments people left on the TV station’s Facebook page. This is “AM Northwest,” ready? I’m gonna read you two comments. Cathy Hunt says, Well, if she’s gonna call me out, I’m gonna call her out. (audience applauding) That’s H-U-N-T. (laughing) Ready for this? “I wish some people would be more mindful of what they say on morning TV. My granddaughter just heard the reference about no Santa Claus. Thanks for opening up that can of worms. (audience laughing) I have changed the channel, perhaps forever, if your guests don’t clean up their act on morning TV.” (audience laughing) (audience applauding) How much fun is that house? Hey, Cathy, maybe your granddaughter should be in school, It’s 10 a.m. (audience laughing) “AM Northwest,” the TV station, responds. (audience laughing) “Hi, Cathy. Please tell your granddaughter that Orny is just mad because he’s on Santa’s naughty list.” (audience laughing) (audience applauding) How old are we? How old are we? Is that shaming? That feels like shaming, by the way. Then they start a hashtag: #CoalForOrny! (audience laughing) Debra C. Taley says, “He’s an idiot!” I’m sorry, T-A-L-E-Y. (audience laughing) “He’s an idiot. Making fun of people with celiac disease is not funny or cool. I wouldn’t pay money to see him.” Then she does the hashtag #CoalForOrny. (audience laughing) So I gotta put an end to this right away. I gotta, I gotta do what people do when they screw up in the spotlight. I either, either have to go into rehab, and I’m not giving up tequila, or, or write a retraction. So this is what I wrote, and I had to handwrite it in after ’cause they deleted it so fast. (audience laughing) Here’s what I wrote. “Earlier today, I misspoke, and I want to be clear. I know Santa exists, and has celiac disease.” (audience laughing) (audience applauding) #OrnylsJewish. (audience laughing) (audience applauding) I used to hate, by the way, Orny Adams is not my real name. I changed it when I was in college. It was Adam Orenstein. And, by the way, that’s one of the things that, that’s what’s wrong on my Wikipedia page. They misspelled my legal name. But I didn’t, I changed my name because I didn’t like people knowing I was, I was Jewish. It was like, it was weird. Like, people, some people don’t like Je',\n",
              "  'ws. I don’t know if you know that. (audience laughing) I always thought, “Well, you know what? Why don’t you hate me first for something else? Then hate me because I’m Jewish.” (audience laughing) When I was younger, people would say anti-Semitic things. They’d come up to me and go, they’d go, “You’re cheap, you’re a Jew, you’re a cheap Jew.” And I said, “I’m seven, I don’t even have money yet.” (audience laughing) (audience applauding) These gluten people. (audience laughing) No, we’ve lost our minds, okay? If we go back to that Portland bit. (audience laughing) People need to just settle down. People need to just settle down. We’re just trying to have a good time. There’s too many people on the planet. That’s what I’m starting to think. And if the Internet has taught us anything, it’s that half this planet needs to be medicated. (audience laughing) (audience applauding) And by that I mean euthanized. I- (audience laughing) Time to get rid of some of these people. I don’t like mean people. I don’t like judgmental people. I don’t like people that don’t let people be people. I don’t like violent people. I don’t like, that’s right. (audience applauding) You know, like these mass shooters. The, wow, you got quiet. Are there, are there any mass shooters here tonight? That was weird, right? This is what I don’t get about mass shooters. And I don’t mean to make light of something really serious, but these people go into movie theaters and they shoot strangers. If you’re that angry at the world, don’t you know people you’d rather kill first? (audience laughing) (audience applauding) Shouldn’t the story be, “And then he invited everybody he ever hated to a movie and he shot ’em”? I’m not even that angry at the world and I have a list of 52 people, 53, 53 people in a… (audience laughing) (audience applauding) We’ve gone nuts. There are seven billion people on the planet. People need to stop having kids. (crowd cheering) How often do you see somebody with a kid and you think, “They shouldn’t have had a kid. (audience laughing) We didn’t need him. Now we got a little version of him.” There are seven billion people on this planet and we’re giving tax breaks to people that have children? How about rewarding the people not overpopulating the planet? (crowd cheering) (audience applauding) I should be able to cut out the UPC code on my condoms, attach it to my 1040. (audience laughing) I want a rebate. You know this wasn’t the plan. You know just 100 years ago, there was just a billion people. God probably took a little nap. Said, “Everything’s fine on Earth. I’m gonna take a little nap.” Wakes up, goes, “What are they doin’ down there? (audience laughing) Seven billion people? They’re sluts. (audience laughing) Give me the book. What did I tell them? ‘Be fruitful and multiply,’ That’s a typo. (audience laughing) I said, ‘Be fruitful and pull out.’ Why did I?” (audience laughing) (audience applauding) We have lost our minds',\n",
              "  '. Do you know now, because of the glutonians, (audience laughing) everything has to have a warning label? 20 years ago, there were no warning labels, right? And we were fine. (audience laughing) (audience applauding) That’s right, we were fine. Sure, a few people died, but we didn’t need those people. Water has a warning label. (crowd cheering) Water has a warning label. Water, water, water, water, water. How much writing is on your faucet? How much writing, first of all, look at all the writing on this bottle of water. Look at it. Look at it. Do, you see it? I don’t like you. Look at the writing on this bottle of water. Look at it, look at this, look at this, look at this! Look at all the writing on this bottle of water. How much writing is on your faucet? Zero. Zero! (audience applauding) They’re so afraid of being sued. Everybody’s suing everybody. I’m suing four people myself right now. (audience laughing) These class action lawsuits, they’re great! You don’t even know you’re suing somebody until you check your mail and there’s a postcard. (audience laughing) “Were you in Best Buy in 2012?” “I guess so.” “Did you buy a flat screen TV?” “I think I did!” “They might owe you money.” “I think they do!” (audience laughing) Where do I sign this important postcard? Then I tell everybody. People are like, “Well, you know, you look exhausted.” I’m like, “Well, I’m suing Best Buy.” (audience laughing) “A lot of stress in my life. We’re going into closing arguments next week.” Water has a warning, Look at all the writing on a bottle of water. “Warning: Do not swallow cap.” (audience laughing) I think we can afford to lose those people, right? (audience laughing) Time to lose some of the cap swallowers. Now we’re down to 6.5 billion. (audience laughing) “Do not refill.” Because maybe some of us will figure out the old stuff tastes a lot like the new stuff. (audience laughing) They’ll put anything on there to protect themselves. Look, “Warning: This was bottled in a factory where there were once peanus, peanuts, ” Did I say penis? Oof, “Warning. (audience laughing) (audience applauding) Warning: This was bottled in a factory, where there were once peanuts. An old, peanut might have fallen into the water. There’s a, there’s a shellfish factory next door. A shellfish might have walked over and dipped its toe in the water. Warning: The guy who bottled this may have had eggs for breakfast. If you’re pregnant, ask your doctor if you can drink water. (audience laughing) May or may not contain water. If you’re still reading this, get help.” (audience laughing) And water has an expiration date. Water can’t expire! (audience applauding) It can evaporate. If you open it up and there’s nothin’ in there, it went bad. (audience laughing) But as long as there’s something in there, nobody’s ever gone, “Shit! It’s sour! Don’t drink the water.” (audience laughing) It sat in a lake for thousands of years. These people put it in a bott',\n",

It’s just, it’s so effortless. It just pops up. It really does. (laughing) That’s what I call a pre-mortgage smile. (audience laughing) He smiles so easily. Like you and me, it takes, like, a second. Like we go to smile and then the world drags our lips down and, I get nervous every time I go to smile, because when I was a kid, I smiled at a girl and I got nervous and my lip dried and it got stuck on my teeth like, and every time I go to smile, I think that’s gonna happen. I’m like, “It’s gonna get stuck again.” (chuckling) But you’re great, dude, really. I just love how, how much fun you have and how carefree you are and you have, like, a nice, little sparkle in your eye. You probably still have dreams. (audience laughing) (audience applauding) You think these people have dreams anymore? No, we have flashbacks! (audience applauding) (crowd cheering) We have flashbacks to where it all went wrong. When you’re in your 20s, you think, “I’m not gonna end up like these old people. I’m gonna live forever. I’m never gonna be the guy who wears a Hawaiian shirt all year long.” (audience laughing) That’s my favorite type of guy, where they just get old and they go, “Screw it. I’m goin’ Hawaiian shirt all year long.” (audience laughing) (audience applauding) “Take me to Tommy Bahama’s, give me the whole lineup.” (audience laughing) There’s a lot of ’em. There’s the one back there. Here’s a third one. My God, my audience has turned into a Jimmy Buffett concert. (audience laughing) (audience applauding) I better be nicer to the millennials. (laughing) When you’re young, you want to know why you get thick when you get older? Food becomes the last joy you have left. (audience laughing) When I’m done eating, I’m depressed, because I’m the furthest away from eating again. (audience laughing) You know what I’m sayin’? I just love how excited you are. You look at a guy like this. This is a guy who’s, you’ve been through something. You can just see it on you. Probably divorced, right? Yup. There you go, there you go. (audience laughing) (audience applauding) Kid? Probably have a kid, right? Yup. Yup. That, that kid ruined your face. That’s what happened. (audience laughing) How, how old are you? I’m 55. 55. I thought you were older. (audience laughing) No, no, no, look at me, look at me. Look at me. No wife, no kids. I’m 64 years old. (audience laughing) (audience applauding) People that are married and have kids, they always look down on people like me. They always say, “We, we figured it out, he never figured.” Let me tell what I have that you guys don’t have. Silence! (audience laughing) (audience applauding) I wake up every day, I’m like, “What, what’s that I’m not hearing? What is that?” I look down, everybody’s safe. On with my selfish day.

Have the, the arrogance of youth, I love it. You probably have a lot of friends still, right, that you hang out with and laugh and have a good time. Not the old people! (audience laughing) Why do you think they’re here tonight? They have to pay a professional to laugh. (audience laughing) (audience applauding) I just ran into a mic stand on my special. You think my life turned out the way I wanted it to? (audience laughing) I’ve lost all my friends to marriage, kids, sobriety, (audience laughing) gluten allergies. (audience laughing) I’m down to three friends. Two I don’t even like. (audience laughing) One I’m hangin’ on to just in case I need a kidney someday. I’ve got a friend for parts. I called him Kidney once by accident. I was like, “Hey, Kidney, Kenny. Did he, he didn’t hear that, did he?” Is that Kenny? (audience applauding) You’ll see what happens to you. You’ll see. How old are you, Kenny? I’m 29. 29. Yeah, you’re dumb too. (audience laughing) (audience applauding) Life is gonna destroy you. I wake up every day, I think, “Why did I drink last night?” And I didn’t even drink. (audience laughing) I have felt hung over for the last 10 years every single day. When you’re 29, you think, “I’m not gonna end up like these old people. I’m gonna be relevant forever. I’m gonna have the perfect life. I’ll never be in the hole to the IRS or to the bank and I’m gonna marry the perfect girl.” That’s what you think, right? Yeah. “And we’re gonna have perfect kids and, and she would never cheat on me.” (audience laughing) And then life is like, “Get in the hole! Get in the hole, get in the hole.” (audience applauding) (crowd cheering) (crowd cheering) “Get in the hole!” “I’ll never have my mom’s hips.” “Get in the hole!” (audience laughing) We wake up every single day in a hole. We just wanna be at street level. We just wanna wake up even. Not feel sore, not feel any pain. That’s all we want. Oh my God. (audience laughing) Can I breathe yet? (audience applauding) I like getting older. I really do. You have something to look forward to. Do you know what I mean? It’s nice to see the finish line, it really is. (audience laughing) I almost signed up for the military last year by accident. Anybody else ever do that? Anybody here serve? Thank you for your service! (audience applauding) Yeah, I said it! I said it first! I’m always the first to say it. I like to be first, ’cause then it feels like I get the most credit for it. (audience laughing) I was at the mall and I saw the service people coming at me. I went, “Thank you for your service!” And then as they got closer, I realized it was Girl Scouts in the, in the uniforms, but, better safe than sorry, right? What branch? Army. Army, there you go, thank you, thank you. (audience applauding) How ',\n",
              "  'old were you when you went in? 18. That’s amazing, that really is. That takes a lot of courage. As I get older, I realize how much courage it really takes to go in at that age. I didn’t have it. I never even thought about serving, but last year I was in Salt Lake City, Utah. And a guy comes running out of the recruitment center. It was on the other side of a parking lot. He scared me, he goes, “Bro! Wanna join the Army?” I thought, “Who are you talking to?” He goes, “You!” I said, “I haven’t even had my morning coffee yet.” (audience laughing) I can’t do anything before I have coffee. I can’t even make coffee until I’ve had a cup of coffee. (audience applauding) Sometimes I have to make a crappy batch just to get to the good batch. So he said, he goes, “Wanna join the Army?” And he was, he was dressed in those camouflage, fatigue, he scared me, you know? I said, “First of all, I can see you.” (audience laughing) Wouldn’t it help the sales pitch if you were camouflaged like a car bumper or something? (audience laughing) I said, “I’m too old.” He said, “How old are you?” I go, “I’m in my 40s.” He goes, “You look like you’re in your 20s!” I go, “Do I look as dumb as Kenny?” (audience laughing) I never thought about serving, but last year, when that guy said to me, “Do you want to serve?” For the first time in my life, I thought, “Yeah. I do.” And that’s when I realized we’re recruiting the wrong people. Let the young people enjoy their lives. Send people like me over there. I’ve lived long enough. I don’t give a shit anymore. I’m ready to die. (audience applauding) I know what we’re fighting for. I’ve got the fire in my belly. I wanna start the Fighting 40s Brigade! (crowd cheering) I wanna put boots on the ground with ankle supports. (audience laughing) We’ll be the greatest army in the world because we won’t care. Bunch of, we’ll run right at the enemy. Bunch of old guys in our Hawaiian shirts running right, “Shoot me, shoot me first, I’m sick of life.” We’ll have our flip-flops going, “Flip-flop, flip-flop, flip-flop.” They’ll hear us coming a mile away. (audience laughing) My dad just turned 70. We bought him an iPad for his birthday. That is the cruelest thing you can do to an old person. The whole time, he’s going, “Where did it go? Everything moves!” Then my four-year-old nephew waddles over, touches something. “Okay, it’s back.” My four-year-old nephew is tech support for my dad. (audience applauding) The kid’s a genius. He takes my iPhone, I think he’s just touching the screen. He found the App Store. He’s downloading kid apps. He cracked my passcode. It’s a thumbprint! (audience laughing) When are we going thumbprint on everything? ‘Cause these passwords are getting hard, When did websites start judging the quality of our passwords? “Weak!” (audience laughing) “That’s pathetic. You call that a passcode? Come on, get to good. Get to good. Meanwhile, my bank card, the one thing that has all my money is ',\n",

You’re out front riding that horsey for 50 cents. Next thing you know, you’re up against the back wall with the walker balls and the diabetes socks and pill cases so you know what day of the week it is. I’m sure eventually a wall opens up and they just suck you into an old age home. (audience laughing) It’s probably right next to that chair where you get your blood pressure taken. If the reading’s too high, the chair probably just starts going back. (audience laughing) (audience applauding) Grab a thing of Grape-Nuts on the way out. That’s how you know it’s over. If you’re eating Grape-Nuts, that’s the end of the line. (audience laughing) There’s no hope in that. It’s a, it’s a black-and-white cover with a piece of dead wheat. The prize inside is reading glasses. (audience laughing) Every time I see people in the blood pressure chair, the old people, I think, “Whose bright idea was it to convince old people to sell their homes, move into an RV and drive across the country?” (audience laughing) They’re losing their eyesight and their reflexes. Let’s put ’em in the biggest vehicle they’ve ever been in. (audience laughing) (audience applauding) I see those things coming, I get the hell out of the way. I treat it like an ambulance. I’ll drive up on yards, you know. This is the world, and we’re all the same. We are really all the same. I realized this the other day. I was in Target. You ever go into Target? [All] Yes. Yeah. I love Target. First of all, I’m overwhelmed when I go in there. There’s too many choices for, how many different size Ziploc bags do we need? (audience laughing) There’s an entire aisle. When I was a kid, there was one size. If you didn’t like it, you went like this. (audience laughing) Now they have snack, snack plus, quart, gallon, three-gallon, jumbo, triple jumbo. They have one for the whole house. You put the whole house in a bag and you zip it up. (audience laughing) (audience applauding) Freezer? Freezer, they’ll do anything to sell you more bags. Freezer, don’t put the room temperature ones in the freezer! That’s gonna void the warranty. Every year they come out with a new style. This year they have easy-open flaps. Which means some people couldn’t figure out the zipper! (audience laughing) This, this was too hard for some people. People are writing in: “Make it easier, make it easier!” The Tide detergent aisle. The Tide, first of all, this is what’s wrong with this country. We have scented trash bags? (audience laughing) If your trash smells li',\n",
              "  'ke trash, take it out. (audience laughing) (audience applauding) Rotten food plus Febreze smells like rotten food plus Febreze. (audience laughing) (audience applauding) There are so many different detergents you can buy now. The aisle, the Tide detergent aisle, there’s a million different scents. There used to be one scent: Original. (audience laughing) Now you got, like, April Fresh. They’re making scents up. Months don’t smell. Nobody’s ever gone, (sniffing) “I smell like November. How do I, how do I get that April Fresh smell?” (audience applauding) I love the people in the Tide detergent aisle, ’cause this, this is everybody. Everybody’s just smelling, everybody. And then when they find the one they like, they put it back and they grab a new one from the back. We are all the same, we are all the same, we are all the same! Everybody is the same! (audience applauding) I went into Target, listen to this. There’s no common sense. We’ve lost our minds. We have gotten so dumb. I saw a guy on a reality show, this is what he said. He goes, “I’m gonna turn my life around 360 degrees.” (audience laughing) You’re gonna be right back where you started, you idiot. You go 180, you stop. You go 360, your life’s gone full circle. Why, why don’t you go 720? Go, go, go 1080, just keep going in, in circles till you pass out from your dumb. I saw a guy on another reality show, he was so drunk, he goes, “I’m so drunk, I’m abbreviated.” Not inebriated, abbreviated. He’s inebriated. His time on TV should be abbreviated. (audience applauding) I mean, we laugh about it, but it’s a serious problem, because the little kids are watching so much TV and you’re picking up secondhand dumb. (audience laughing) I went into Target. I went into Target, ready for this? I went into Target, bought a bunch of stuff, used a coupon, paid with my American Express. The guy goes, “Sir, sir, I need to see your ID.” I go, “What for?” He goes, “Well, you know, to make sure the card isn’t stolen.” I said, “I just used a coupon. (audience laughing) Why would I use a coupon if the card was stolen?” (audience laughing) (audience applauding) You got me there! I’m busted! 15 minutes ago, I mugged a guy. I felt bad, I wanted to save him 75 cents on April Fresh Tide. There’s no common sense. It’s like every year, my cable bill goes up by, like, $100 and I have to call and threaten to leave. (audience laughing) I’m not even nice anymore. I just call ’em up, I go, “Lower the bill.” They go, “Who is this?” I go, “It’s me. Now lower the bill.” (audience laughing) They go, “How do we know? What’s your Social? What’s your street address? What’s your-” I said, “I’m calling to lower the bill. I’m sorry, are people stealing people’s identities, calling up and lowering their cable bills? (audience applauding) Is there some sort of epidemic I don’t know about? Lower my bill! Put that in the notes. ‘If anybody calls to lower Orny’s bill, lower it!’ (audience applauding)',\n",
              "  ' “I don’t care if somebody calls by accident. Lower the bill. They don’t have to know my mother’s maiden name, my shoe size, my first pet’s pet, they could call by accident. My next call to you guys will be, ‘Why did my bill go down?’ Some 12-year-old named Hudson called up during recess.” (audience applauding) There’s no common sense. I find myself every day making this face. Every day I just go. (audience laughing) You ever catch someone doing something dumb and you roll your eyes and they don’t catch you rolling your eyes, so now you have to re-roll them even louder? (audience laughing) (audience applauding) “What?” There’s no common sense. I got a ticket ’cause the thieves in Los Angeles are stealing off of our license plates the little registration year sticker. Yes, and you don’t know your sticker’s missing! (audience laughing) ‘Cause you don’t go out to your car every morning and go, “Is my sticker still there?” You don’t know until you get a ticket. So I called the DMV, I said, “Hey, there’s a mix-up. I got a ticket but my car’s registered.” And she says, she goes, “Sir, sir, you need to prove to us that your car is registered.” I said, “I’m sorry, am I talking to the DMV? (audience laughing) (audience applauding) Isn’t that a little piece of information you should have?” She goes, “Sir, it’s policy. You need to send us a copy of your registration.” I said, “I don’t even know where that is!” (audience laughing) She said, “We’d be happy to send you a copy.” (audience laughing) (audience applauding) To send back to us.” This is the sick world that I live in! I didn’t even open up the envelope. I just wrote “Return to sender.” (audience laughing) Every day is a fight, it’s a struggle. My printer broke, I call customer service. By the way, have you noticed when your cable goes out, they don’t try and fix it. The first thing they do is they try and bundle you. (audience laughing) “We notice you don’t have phone service with us. Would you like phone service with us?” “No, ’cause then I wouldn’t be able to make this phone call right now.” (audience laughing) “Fix my cable, then sell me stuff.” I like when you call up and the first thing you hear is, “Please listen carefully, as our menu options have changed.” If your customers are memorizing your menu options, fix your product. (audience laughing) (audience applauding) My printer broke, I call H-P. The first thing they say, “Is it plugged in?” “Yeah, I, I’m an adult. Did I, did I call the kiddie line? Is this…” The guy got nervous, he goes, “Well, can I ask you, what, what are you using the printer for?” (audience laughing) “I’m using it to iron. Is that the problem? I’m making flapjacks. Sometimes I open the hood, I put the batter in there and then I hit ‘Print’ with my foot. Am I using it wrong? Fix my printer!” (audience applauding) Every day is a fight. Every day is a struggle. I got into a fight with a waitress. I asked her, I go, “What’s good on the m',\n",
              "  'enu?” And then she didn’t suggest anything I wanted. So I had to have that discussion with her. (audience laughing) I said, “How’s the burger?” She goes, “I don’t know. I don’t eat meat.” Now she’s gonna turn my meal into a political protest. (audience laughing) She goes, “I’m a vegan.” You know how they say it all judgmental sometimes? “I’m a vegan.” I go, “Well, I’m a me-gan.” (audience laughing) (audience applauding) You know what I told her? “You know why I eat meat? Because we made it to the top of the food chain.” That’s right. The cow had a chance to stand up and learn a language like us. But the cow stayed down! The cow stayed down! (audience applauding) You know why I eat meat? What’s in the word “meat”? Eat. The word is actually “me eat.” It couldn’t be any clearer, unless they added the extra “E.” (audience applauding) Me-e-e-eat. It’s probably how it got its name. One day, a caveman’s chewing on a bison leg. The other one’s like, “What’s that?” “Me eat! Me want, me eat.” (audience laughing) You know what’s in the word “vegan”? Nothing! (audience laughing) It’s probably short for, “Vegetables again?” (audience laughing) (audience applauding) Every day is a fight. That’s why I like doing this. When I’m up here, this is the only part of my day that feels right. This is, this is justice for me. The rest of the day is a fight. It’s a struggle. (audience applauding) People don’t listen to me during regular hours. I say stuff, I get in trouble all the time. People don’t love me the way you guys love me. (crowd cheering) (audience applauding) This is justice. This is ju, I was in Chicago, and a guy came up to me and he said, “Seven years ago, I saw you for the first time and I’ve come back every single year to see you with the woman I met on a blind date that first night. And we now have a three-year-old kid.” (crowd awwing) And in that moment, I realized how little I have gotten done in the last seven years. (audience laughing) (audience applauding) This is justice. I don’t have this in my real life. Dating? My last relationship ended because, well, we were different. I was a morning person and she was nuts. (audience laughing) Complicated. Do I have to say “complicated” now? Do I have to clean it up for the stupid little millennials and say, “She was complicated. She was complicated.” She was nuts! (audience laughing) (audience applauding) I was always in trouble. Listen, I thought I was being romantic one night, ready for this? Everything was “mean.” She was always, “You’re mean. You’re mean.” Even when I wasn’t being mean! Look at her put her arm around him. Do you say that to him all the time? Is he mean? Is he mean? Do you get it all the time? All the time. We’re not even being mean. Are we? I said to her, I go, “Hey, do you mind putting the half-and-half away?” She goes, “You’re mean!” (audience laughing) I didn’t say, “Hey, the half-and-half doesn’t put itself away every day.” I thought that, but',\n",
              "  ' I didn’t say it. (audience laughing) (audience applauding) I thought I was being romantic one night. Ready for this? We’re cuddling, and she’s very petite and beautiful. And I go, “You’re so soft. It’s like cuddling with a marshmallow.” (audience laughing) I know it’s wrong now! (audience laughing) (audience applauding) Dumb me, I thought I was being cute and romantic, you know? Until I got the look. Women, when you do something wrong, you get the look. They just, their neck snaps back like, (audience laughing) They couldn’t be further away from you. I had to start backpedaling. I’m like, “Like, a size-two marshmallow! A stale, size-two marshmallow. A strong, independent stale marshmallow that we have sex on the side marshmallow. I’m a marshmallow! I’m a stupid marshmallow!” (audience applauding) Wanna know the last thing she said to me when we broke up? The last thing as I was getting the keys back to my house. Now, people say things in the heat of the moment. This was bad. She looked at me and she said, “Do you wanna know why you never made it as a comedian? (crowd oohing) Because you’re mean!” (audience laughing) (audience applauding) And I thought, well, thank God she thinks I’m funny ’cause, you know, Mean I can fix. Funny, you kinda gotta be born with that. That would’ve broken my heart if she was like, “You didn’t make it ’cause you’re not funny.” That would’ve devastated me. We’re not that smart, women. If you wanna live a happy life, okay? Take the marshmallow example, okay? If you wanna be happy with him that you think he’s mean sometimes. And you wanna be happy, you wanna be happy, right? It it is so simple. All women have to do to be happy in this lifetime, whatever your expectation of man is, lower it! (audience applauding) (crowd cheering) That’s it! Lower it to the ground! Lower it. Lower your bar. Lower your bar. Lower your bar of men. We can meet ground. We can meet ground. We wake up in the hole every day anyway. We’ll just stay there. We’re not that smart, men. Why do you think our shirts have pockets on the outside? So we know it’s on right. (audience laughing) (audience applauding) I met a guy once, he drove a truck. I was just trying to make conversation. I go, “What do you drive? An F-150?” He goes, “250!” I go, “What’s the difference?” He goes, “100.” That’s my people. That’s my people. That’s my people. Lower the bar. And we’re arrogant! Every time I go out with my married friends, if a beautiful woman walks by, one of them will go, “Man, if I wasn’t married!” If you weren’t married what? (audience laughing) (audience applauding) I knew you when you weren’t married. You weren’t getting that. (audience laughing) That’s why you got married. Are you gonna go not get her number like you used to when you weren’t married? Married men, they like to, they like to look at other women and when they get caught they say things like, “Well, I’m not dead.” Yes, you are. (audience laughing) See, t',\n",
              "  \"hat’s what’s wrong with men. We see virility and living as getting women. Women are more evolved. You want to settle down, right? You want the white picket fence. We see that fence we think, “Shit, I gotta paint that every year.” (audience laughing) (audience applauding) We can’t be what you want us to be. You want that romantic guy. The guy in the movies. The “Every kiss begins with ‘K'” guy. (audience laughing) That guy has ruined more relationships. You wanna know what killed romance? Terrorism. Well, now the guy can’t chase the girl to the airport anymore like in the movies. (audience laughing) (audience applauding) He’s gotta sit outside at the curb texting her. “I’ve decided I love you. You’re the one, but you need to come out ’cause I can’t get past security, (audience laughing) (audience applauding) Damnit, there’s a cop behind me. Okay, I’ve gotta go to the cell phone waiting line. When you come out, text me and I’ll swoop in just like in the movies with the flowers.” We can’t be what you want us to be. You want that romantic guy, the big proposal so you can tell your friends. Girls love to tell their friends about exciting things, right? Every girl, first of all, women are very smart ’cause they work together as a group. (audience laughing) And every girl has a little subgroup. You have a committee. Every girl has a committee. And when she goes out on a date, she comes home, the committee has a lot of questions. (audience laughing) All we have is one friend, he just wants to see a picture. (audience laughing) (audience applauding) No guy has ever come home from a date and his friends are like, “Tell me all about her! What was she like? Does she have any hobbies? Is she close with her family?” No, get to the picture! And does she have any cute friends I can date? They want romance, the proposal. You ever see somebody propose that you don’t know? Isn’t that weird? I was out to eat at a fancy restaurant. Sitting there at the fancy restaurant, having a good time. I’m, you know, sitting there with marshmallow so, (audience laughing) there’s some pressure from her committee. And the guy next to me decides to ruin the night by proposing. (audience laughing) And he couldn’t get the ring out. This stupid F-150 guy didn’t rehearse getting the ring out. It was stuck in his pocket, he’s sweating like I am. He was like, “I have a question!” I’m like, “This guy’s having a seizure!” (audience laughing) All the women knew what was going on because a proposal, they can, (sniffing) (audience applauding) they can smell it from miles away. “It’s a proposal! Somebody’s dream is coming true! Over here! Over here! Come on in! Get the boxes of tissues!” Every guy in the place was like, “I don’t need this shit tonight.” (audience laughing) (audience applauding) So now we all turn to watch the big moment. The guy got on his knee, proposed, and she said “No.” (crowd awwing) It’s the greatest thing I’ve ever seen! (audience a\",\n",
              "  'pplauding) I’ve never been happier. To be that close to somebody’s lowest point in their life? I was like, “Get in the hole! Get in the hole! Get in the hole!” I didn’t think it could get any better and then all of a sudden, the waiter started coming out with a sparkly cake. He had to do a U-turn, he’s like, “Abort the mission! Abort the mission! Abort the mission! Abort the mission!” How did the guy not know? How did the guy not know? How did the guy not know? How did the guy not know? Women let you know when they want something. You don’t tell us outright. You like to play a little game called Hint: You Figure It Out. (audience laughing) And you better figure it out. Like, a woman doesn’t ask to move into your house. No, no, no, no, no. She starts a little pile in the corner. (audience laughing) Then they want a drawer. I picture them sitting around with the committee going, “Did you get a drawer yet? Did you get a drawer yet? Did you take your toothbrush and spike it in the bathroom like we did the flag on the moon? I am here!” Then they take their hairs and they throw ’em all over the place! (audience applauding) “My kitchen, my bathroom, my ceiling!” (audience applauding) (crowd cheering) God created women’s hair so men don’t cheat. (audience laughing) We love you, women. But we can never be what you want us to be. We’re just too simple. We’re not smart. When we meet women, you know what we do? We try and change you overnight. (audience laughing) Women know you can’t change a person, right? That’s right. But you can break ’em. (audience laughing) That’s what they do. They take years. They find a guy that is good enough and they chisel him down. (audience laughing) They chisel, and chisel, and chisel, and chisel, and chisel, and chisel, and chisel, and chisel. (audience applauding) “And don’t wear the Hawaiian shirt to the comedy show!” (audience laughing) (audience applauding) Why do you think guys like mowing the lawn so much? We’d rather hear, (imitating lawn mower) than whatever you have to say. It’s the same reason you guys blow dry your hair for so long. It can’t take that long. You probably keep wetting your hair so that you can stay in there. “I can’t take another word from him!” Why do you think that thing is shaped like a gun? (audience laughing) “He won’t shut up!” We love you, women, but we can’t be what you want us to be. We try, we can’t figure you out. You’re too delicate. You guys are like that string of Christmas tree lights where if one of the bulbs is out, the whole operation is down. (audience applauding) You make one mistake, she just shuts down and you don’t know which bulb it is. You have to guess, “Is this the problem? Is this the problem? Is this the problem? Is this the problem? Is this the problem? Is this the problem? Is this the problem? Is this the problem? Is this the problem? Is this? Is this? Is this? Is this? Is this? Is this? Is this? Is this? Is this? Is this? (crowd c',\n",
              "  'heering) And the dumb man is like, “Screw it, I’ll just go buy a new one.” (audience laughing) What I’m trying to tell you women is get married as close to your death as possible. (audience laughing) Men actually get better with age. It’s biological. You wanna know what happens as you get older? All of a sudden, the TV commercials start talking to you. (audience laughing) (audience applauding) Right now, you don’t hear ’em. One day, you’ll be sitting around it’s like, “Are you a male over the age of 40?” (audience laughing) That’s me! What’s going on? Is everything okay? “Do you not have as much energy as you used to have?” No, I’m exhausted! What is it? “Do you still print stuff?” Yes, I do! (audience laughing) (audience applauding) “You might have a treatable condition called ‘low-T’.” Low-T. Low testosterone. They’re making shit up. (audience laughing) This is like gluten and Santa Claus, it doesn’t exist. This is what happens to men as we get older. It’s natural. And they talk about it like it’s a bad thing. Low-T is the greatest thing to happen to men. (audience applauding) Every, every, every, every bad decision I ever made was on high-T. (audience laughing) (audience applauding) Low-T is a blessing. High-T destroys lives. Nothing bothers Low-T Man. I’m driving, somebody flips me off in traffic, Low-T Guy just keeps going. (audience laughing) (audience applauding) I go out on a date, I don’t think she likes me. Great, I’ll get eight hours of sleep tonight. (audience laughing) (audience applauding) You wanna be happy? Lower your bar, we’ll lower our T. Let’s meet halfway, we can do it. (crowd cheering) Thank you. (crowd cheering) (audience applauding) [Crowd] Orny! Orny! Orny! Orny! Orny! Orny! Orny! Orny! Orny! Orny! Orny! Orny! Orny! (crowd cheering) It’s been a long road and I really, I can’t thank everybody enough who’s been here for me. And I thank you so much.

              " ['[“Hard to Kill” by Bleached plays] [audience cheering and applauding] Hello! Denver! [cheering and applause continues] [Patton laughs] Oh my God! Hello. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. [cheering continues] Thank you. Oh my God! Yes! Thank you all so much for coming out tonight. Um… Hey, I broke my foot. Yeah. That’s how I started my year. I broke my foot. Uh… It was… It took two… It happened in two parts. Uh, the second part was I slipped off a curb and I landed wrong. That was the second part. The first and most important part was I turned 53. That is the crucial part. [audience laughs] I… You turn… Once you get past 50, everything’s fatal. I… When I was in my twenties, I would walk into propellers and put some Bactine on it. I was fine. And now if a pine cone falls near me, my spine implodes. I don’t know what… Like that. [audience laughs] Broke my foot, and then the day after… I’m gonna drop a name. All right. Uh, the day after I broke my foot, Glenn Howerton, my friend Glenn Howerton… [audience cheers] …who is almost 50, but for this bit he’s over 50. I needed to… Come on, who cares about logic? He broke his collarbone. So I called him up, gave him a little solidarity, a little support. “Hey, man. I broke my foot.” “What happened?” In my mind, I’m thinking, “Well, he was probably reaching for a bag of SunChips wrong, and his collarbone broke or something.” And he said, “Yeah, I was snowboarding. I landed a flip wrong.” All right. Fuck off. Fuck off. [audience laughing] You don’t need to go to that much hassle. Once you get to a certain age, you don’t need… I don’t even think that’s what happened. I think he’s lying to me. I think… I think somebody slammed a door near him, and then his collarbone fell into his ass cheek. And then he told his wife, “Duct-tape me to a snowboard and push me down a black diamond trail, please.” “Give me some dignity for God’s sake.” [audience laughing] I’m gonna drop another name. A month after I broke my foot, Tony Hawk broke his… [audience cheering] …broke his femur in two. Pow! Landed a vertical wrong. In his warehouse, doing his verticals, landed it wrong. Broke his femur. DMs me a picture of his X-ray. He’s like, “Looks like we’re in the same boat, buddy.” I’m like, “No, we’re fucking not.” You… [audience laughing] You just Jackie-Channed yourself into even more coolness. [audience laughs] He fo',\n",
              "  'und a whole other level of cool. I slipped off a curb like someone’s aunt that saw a bird. That is how I went down. [audience laughs] I went down in the most embarrassing way possible. [audience chuckling] And the one weird thing that happened, ’cause when I did it I was still in my 23-year-old denial head of, “I just twisted my ankle. I’ll drive home.” I was at work. “I’ll drive home. I’ll be fine.” Driving home, it’s hurting worse. “Oh, this actually might be a real thing.” I get home. I can barely get out of the car now. And I’m limping across the street to my house. And it’s really hurting, and then a car pulls up, these two women are driving, and the driver rolls her window down and says, “You okay?” I’m like, “Oh, I twisted my ankle. I live right here.” “I’m going inside, put some ice on it.” And then, and this haunts me, she said, “Well, don’t give up.” [audience laughing] Which… Wait. What? Holy shit! What was the look on my face? [audience laughing] What did I… Did she… “He’s gonna kill himself. Pull over. Pull over.” “Hey, don’t give up.” “Let me play this Peter Gabriel, Kate Bush song. This’ll really…” “Let’s listen to this.” Maybe that was just my face left over from the shutdown and the pandemic. Is that how my face permanently is now? Because I didn’t do the shutdown well at all. I did a bad shutdown. I planned a great shutdown. I planned an amazing… Remember when the shutdown happened? Supposed to stay home, and you had that little memory of all the times you said, “If I could just get a month off, I could get my shit together.” [audience laughs] “I could get my life… I just need a month off.” I planned a great shutdown. I executed the worst one ever. Oh my God, the list I made. The list we all made. We all made the same list? Yes, you did. All the great books you were gonna read. All the great books. All the skills you were gonna learn. Oh my God, we couldn’t wait to work on ourselves. If I had actually followed the list that I made, there’d be a different man standing in front of you right now. He’d be 30 pounds lighter. He’d be speaking fluent Italian. [audience laughs] When all of you walked in, there would have been a handmade raspberry almond crumble tart on everyone’s chair, on each chair. I would have hand-milled the flour this morning. [audience laughing] You would have eaten it off of an origami plate. [audie',\n",
              "  'nce laughs] When you’re done eating, you throw the plate down, it pops up into a frog. Oh my God! Oh, the plans I had! [audience laughing] I didn’t do any of that shit. I ate Doritos for breakfast, and I watched Deadwood twice all the way through. Watched it. Finished it. Back to episode one. Hit play. [audience laughing] That’s all I fucking did. And then I went crazier than a barn full of clown pubes. That is what I did during the shutdown. And listen, when I… When I say, “Crazier than a barn full of clown pubes…” [audience laughing] …I’m not kink-shaming. I’m not judging. [audience laughs] Clowns have as much right to have a varied and experimental, adventurous sex life. I’m saying the source of the crazy isn’t the clown pubes. It’s the having the thought and then the follow-through of “I’m gonna fill this barn…” [audience laughing] “…with the p…” I just want that to be clear. That the source of the crazy is the barn. The barn full of pubes isn’t even the crazy. It was the act of filling the barn… Listen, if you… If you just filled a barn with pubes, you’ve checked off the crazy box. [audience laughing] But this person went, “I’m putting obstructions in my way.” “I will only collect the pub…” Also, how do you… There’s no way to know. Clown pubes don’t look different. Like, they’re not bright orange. They’re not rainbow-colored. Look. Some are, but a lot… There’s a lot of… Listen. There… There’s a lot of non-clown pubes that are bright orange and rainbow-colored. That’s not what I’m saying here. What I’m saying is there’s no way that… Okay, this is what I’m saying. Wait. Fuck. Okay. If you… Like, okay, if you’re walking around… [audience laughing] …and there’s a barn, and you open those two big doors, there’s a wall of pubes, and you go, “Well, there’s a maniac roaming the countryside.” If someone said, “Those are only clown pubes.” Like, “Oh! We gotta call the National Guard.” Wait a minute. What? ‘Cause there’s no way to prove that. [audience laughing] Oh, okay, wait. You could do this. Every time… Every time that you collect… Not… Not a… Not a clump. That’s gross. Not a clump of… No. [audience laughing] Clump is too gross. Thatch? No. [audience laughs] Thatch is too folksy. That’s… That’s the other… Like, if Cracker Barrel opened a BDSM store, they would call it the Thatch of Pubes. That’s what it would be called. You’d go down ',\n",
              "  'to the Th… It’d probably be connected to the Cracker Barrel. You’d go in, get a nice breakfast, then go, “Hang on. I gotta pop into the Thatch of Pubes.” [audience laughs] “Pay the bill. I’ll meet you at the front.” [audience laughing] Thatch of Pu… ♪ Thatch of Pubes ♪ [audience laughs] [laughing] We… ♪ We’ve got nipple clamps And scented lubes ♪ [audience laughs] We’ve got floggers, and paddles, and dildos. Oh my! And a tower of butt plugs that kisses the sky. [audience laughs] Tell ’em Petunia the pube pig sent ya. [audience laughs] Oink. All right. Um… [audience laughs] Handful. Handful of clown pubes. That’s non-gender specific. Every time you collect a handful of clown pubes, you take a Polaroid. You have a Polaroid, so you’re kneeling down. You’re collecting the pubes. You got your baggy. Gotta do it full length. Get the whole clown in there. He or she’s gotta be in their wig, their makeup, holding that day’s newspaper… [audience laughing] …so you know. Then you take a hole-punch, punch a hole through the Polaroid, get a ribbon, put it through that hole, tie the other end of the ribbon to the… the… the handful of pubes, toss it in the barn… Every handful of pubes is accounted for. There you go. And that’s how you would pro… Fuck, no. No, you can’t. You know why? No, that doesn’t work, because then someone can go, “Technically, you didn’t fill the barn with pubes because the ribbon and the Polaroid took up…” No, it has to be complete confidence in the speaker and total trust in the listener. When you say I tho… This is what’s happening right now, okay? We’re starting this set out. Let’s go on a journey for the next hour. I started off pretty strong, I think. I think I’ve won your trust, but you know what? You shouldn’t 100%… No. Not yet though. [audience laughing] Because what you’ve got… Listen. What I’ve done, comedically, creatively, I have opened the barn doors. [audience laughing] And there’s a wall of pubes. [audience laughing] And yes, it’s impressive, but you’re right to go, “You know what?” “I bet that wall of pubes, I bet that’s a half an inch thick.” “And there’s a big sheet of plywood behind, and the rest of the barn is empty.” “I’ve been screwed over too many…” You’re right to think that. What I’m… This is what I’m doing. As a comedian, I’m inviting you… I’m saying I want you to run as hard as you can into this wall',\n",
              "  ' of pubes, and then, I want you to fight your way back, just fight your way to the back of the barn… [audience laughing] …until you’re cocooned in pubes. You know what I mean? At the back. And when your hand hits that back wall, you will think, “I met a man of honor.” That is what you will think. [audience laughing] That is what I want for us. Not me, not you, us. All of us. That’s what I want. Those are the kind of bits I wrote during the shutdown. I’d be awake for eight days in a row… [applause] Five in the morning, “The fucking Polaroid doesn’t even work!” Goddamn it! [audience cheering and applauding] I bought a trampoline. [audience laughs] Not a giant backyard… One of those little workout ones. Yeah. Little tiny trampoline. It’s called a rebounder. Awesome. You get up on it. You hop up and down, get the lymphatic system going, “Here you go. Ooh. Out, in. Forward, back. Ski it out.” Great workout. Got it right at the beginning of the pandemic. “I’m gonna stay fit during this thing, man. I got my new rebounder.” It came out of the box, not a speck of dust on it. Oh, I was so excited. I could feel how excited the rebounder was. You could feel it. He was like, “I’m gonna make a difference in this house.” “I belong here. I’m gonna change things for the better.” I’m like, “That’s right, little rebounder. Wanna go inside the house?” “You wanna go in the gym?” He’s like, “Yeah.” We have a gym in our house. It’s a room with an elliptical in it. We call it a gym. [audience laughs] I take him inside. Oh, he’s so excited. I put him down. “I’ll see you tomorrow, little rebounder.” He goes, “Yeah.” We both looked over at the elliptical. [audience laughs] Against the wall. Clothes hanging off of it. [audience laughs] Covered in dust. And I could feel the rebounder’s heart break. I could feel his… You know what it felt like? It felt like the rookie cop fresh out of the academy. He’s like, “Give me the worst precinct in town. I’ll turn it around!” “I’ve got progressive policing techniques, community outreach.” “I’ll make a difference.” And he shows up that first day, big thermos of green tea, little keto lunch, he’s all excited. Looks over in the corner, “Who’s at his desk?” The old homicide cop. [audience laughs] Eight bullet holes in him. Eleven colostomy bags. [audience laughing] He’s having his seventh Viceroy of the morning. [audience laug',\n",
              "  \"hing] [Patton exhales] That’s the elliptical. [audience laughing] Looks at the little rookie rebounder, “You’re gonna learn, kid.” [audience laughing] “You think I didn’t have dreams when I came here, huh?” “I was top of the line!” “You can stream movies on me, TV shows, mountain programs, everything!” “Oh! I was gonna turn this house of fatties around.” [audience laughing] “That guy that just dropped you off, he was on me day one.” “Cute little workout outfit.” “Little iPhone. He downloaded a bunch of podcasts on it.” “Ooh, a thinker!” [audience laughing] “He gets up on me, stretch those little fat thighs, pumping them up and down.” [grunting] “Thought he was gonna go the distance.” “He didn’t make it past the first Blue Apron ad.” [inhales, exhales] [audience laughing] “Hopped off of me.” “Went and checked his texts in the crapper.” [audience laughs] “He never came back.” [audience laughs] “Oh, he’ll be here tomorrow.” “Oh, he’ll be in his little workout outfit.” “He’ll probably put a little playlist on his iPhone.” “Yeah.” “He’s a Gen X-er in his fifties.” “I bet it’ll be all early ’80s New Wave pop.” [audience laughs] “That’s how he’s gonna get thin. Nostalgia.” [audience laughs] “He’ll hop up on you, start jumping up and down like a gibbon full of Skittles.” [audience laughs] “What’ll be the first song he listens to? I can call it right now.” “It’ll be the Go-Go’s ‘Our Lips Are Sealed.'” “That’ll be the first song.” “And you’ll be all excited. ‘Oh, he’s gonna go the full hour'”! “He won’t make it past the bridge.” [audience laughs] “The minute Jane Wiedlin starts singing, “Hush my darling,” he’ll hop off of you, he’ll check his texts in the crapper.” “He’ll never come back.” [audience laughs] “Extinguish all joy within you, and nothing’ll ever hurt you again.” [audience laughs] I just pitched the saddest Pixar movie in the… If they do a movie with the Safdie brothers, that’s gotta be their movie. Harvey Keitel is the elliptical. [audience laughing] Timothée Chalamet is the rebounder. [audience laughing] And Frances McDormand is the half-inflated exercise ball. [audience laughs] Went fucking crazy during the shutdown. My rock-bottom, psychologically, during the shutdown happened on the same day as my wife and daughter’s. We all hit crazy rock-bottom at the same time. Um, it was a weekday. We’re all in the house, staying inside. D\",\n",
              "  'oing our part. Stop the spread. My daughter’s in the kitchen, and out of nowhere, she says, “Hey, there’s a weird guy in our backyard.” [audience laughing] What the fuck? I go running out, “What?” Looking out, “I don’t see anybody. You saw someone?” She goes, “Some weird guy just walked across our backyard and went around the back. He’s back there right now.” I’m like, “Oh shit!” We have cameras all over the property. I have an app on my phone. You click it and can look at what the camera sees. I’m waiting for it. I’m gonna go back and confront him. I just wanna know what I’m about to deal with. I don’t know what’s back there. What if it’s a lost hippie wanting someone to hacky-sack with him? “I’ll hacky-sack with you.” [audience laughing] Could be a maniac, nude, with a bucket of chicken on his dick, holding a sword. I don’t know what’s back… I just wanna be ready. [audience laughing] But the cameras aren’t loading, and I’m waiting for it. Goddamn it. And then my wife pushes past us, doesn’t say anything and goes striding across the back lawn. She’s got a white summer dress on flowing in the wind, barefoot. And she’s holding a pink, aluminum baseball bat. [audience laughing] And she has serious Manson girl energy coming off of her, like… [audience laughs] “Look at that hot, hippie chick that I wanna fuck and get murdered by.” “Yay.” [laughing] So, she… It takes me a second to realize what she’s doing, then I go clomping after her, in my flip-flops and cargo pants, but she’s already around the corner and she’s already laying into this guy. Before I can turn the corner, I hear her screaming at him, “Who the fuck are you? Get the fuck out of my yard!” “I will fuck you up.” [audience laughing] [audience cheering and applauding] So… I… I turned the corner. She’s in a stance. [audience laughs] Like Uma in Kill Bill, she’s ready to go. [audience laughs] The guy she’s yelling at, little scruffy looking, didn’t look crazy, didn’t look homeless, holding a cell phone, just looked a little off, and she’s screaming and yelling at him, “What the fuck are you doing here?” Now I’m gonna stop the story and tell you what was actually happening. There was something wrong with our air conditioner. I… [audience laughing] I called our contractor and said, “Can you send someone to the house to fix the AC?” Without telling us, he gave this guy our address ',\n",
              "  'and gate code and sent him to the house. So yes, massive misunderstanding. My wife is now screaming at him, and she’s just fucking… Just blazing Valkyrie, shrieking at the top of her lungs at this guy, “Who the fuck are you?” Now, to his discredit… [audience laughing] …when there is a blazing-eyed Valkyrie holding a vagina-colored piece of metal… [audience laughing] …threatening to kill you, answer in short, declarative sentences. [audience laughing] [applause] This guy… This guy was going, “Who’s anybody really, man? Like…” “Every day was… Oh, the wheel in the sky…” Oh, goddamn it. Now she’s got both hands on the bat. She’s gonna swing on the guy. And then he looks at me. And when he looks at me, that’s when he gets scared. [audience laughs] He started saying, “My name is Michael. Your guy Steve sent me here to figure…” And my wife’s like, “Oh my God, he didn’t tell us. I’m so sorry.” “Oh my God, I’m gonna call him right now.” “I’m… This was… This really got off on the wrong foot.” “How about you leave…” The guy was more than happy to leave. [audience laughs] I’m sure he was driving home going, “That poor bastard. Oh my God.” “I’m sure the sex is amazing but…” Um… [audience laughing] A lot of you hear the story and go, “That’s not very manly of you.” “You let your wife… God knows what could’ve happened!” I argue the opposite. [audience laughs] I say that our timing and placement made us a more effective home invasion deterrent. [audience laughs] ‘Cause remember he never got scared when she was screaming at him? He just kept going, “I…” You know why? He couldn’t process what he was seeing. [audience laughs] Gorgeous Valkyrie, vagina-colored metal, screaming. Too much. Too fucking much. Couldn’t process it. And also, again, the energy she’s giving off is outer-space sex vixen about to murder you. [audience laughing] Can’t process it. You know what he could process? Me. Standing five feet behind her, ’cause the energy I was giving off was, “I can’t do nothing when she gets like this.” “I… I tried to get her to go to the nervous hospital, see?” “She said she’d burn the house down.” “She’s killed so many Amazon delivery drivers.” “I can’t dig no more holes in the desert. Please just run!” [audience laughing] I’m doing some poses that we can freeze for the Netflix save screen. A little… [audience laughing] [cheering and applause] [Patton ',\n",
              "  'chuckles] [audience laughing] There’s gotta be… What if I did… What if I use… Here’s what I’m gonna do. Watch. Like this. [audience laughing and cheering] Now, look. That’s… That’s not a bit in the special, but if you’re watching Netflix, and that “coming up next,” you’re like, “Let’s watch a minute of that.” Like, “What the fuck is this?” [audience laughing] [Patton chuckling] I’m vaxxed and boosted. Yes, I am. Thank you. It shouldn’t… [cheering and applause] Thank you. But… That… Look. Thank you. It’s also sad that gets applause at this point, isn’t it? You get applause for taking the most basic care of your health? That’s like me going, “Folks, I wipe after I shit. Thank…” No. No, no. [cheering and applause] People. No. I’m no… I’m no hero now. It’s the lumberjacks who cut down the trees that make the toilet… Those are the heroes. [audience laughing] [man] Yeah! [chuckles] I assume there’s a lumberjack here. All right, um… [audience laughs] [Patton chuckles] Or a really enthusiastic wiper. Um… [audience laughing] I got my vax right when the vax came out. Immediately. I didn’t jump the line. I didn’t use my privilege, but… I acted on some inside information, and I feel bad about this. This is how I did it. Uh… Right when the vaccine came out, I have a friend, lives out in Riverside. And he calls me and says, “I don’t know if I should tell you this, but, uh, out where I’m living, it’s MAGA country.” “No one is getting the vaccine.” “There’s a Rite Aid near me, a woman sitting at a table.” “Everyone that walks in she asks if they want it. No one will get it.” “They’re throwing crates of this shit out the back.” “If you drive out here, you will get a shot.” “Don’t even make an appointment.” So I drove out there. I walk in. There’s a woman at a table. I go, “Hi, excuse me. I’d like to get a vaccine.” She was like, “You would?” Like, she had no… [audience laughing] She had run out of Tolkien novels to read. Like, “Yeah. Let me get you set up.” Like, “Go stand over there.” While I’m waiting, my friend was right, everyone that walked in, “Would you like a vaccine?” “No, thank you.” And one guy gave her a, uh… “[scoffs] Yeah, no thanks.” [audience laughs] Like, “Yeah, nice try, Deep State. I think I’m gonna, uh…” “I think I’m gonna stay tracker-free for the time being if that’s all right.” “Hang on. Yeah. I’m at the Rite Aid again. Yeah.” ',\n",
              "  '“They tried to get a fucking track… Hang on. I’m losing you.” “There you are. Yeah, no. I’m off the grid, man. That’s…” “Right. I’ll call you later.” Got my shot. Got my second shot, then boosted twice. I’m fucking fine. In 1955, the polio vaccine came out. 1955. We were two years away from satellites. There were no satellites! And America could not have been more backward, racist, homophobic, sexist, and these non-satellite-having, racist dipshits lined the fuck up to get their fucking vaccine! [cheering and applause] What the fuck! [cheering and applause continues] “Give me that shot. I can’t police these water fountains from a wheelchair.” [audience laughing] “I can’t beat up queers inside an iron lung! Give me my science!” “What am I, a caveman?” [audience laughing] Now it’s the year 2022, which, first off, doesn’t sound like a real year, does it? [audience laughs] Doesn’t that sound made up? Like you’re watching a cheap science-fiction film, “In the year 2022…” “Oh, you’re just throwing numbers together. Jesus!” “Who wrote this shit?” [audience laughs] It’s 2022. We have robots on Mars. They send us TikTok videos. [audience laughing] Half of the country’s like, “That needle’s got witch poison in it, I tells ya.” “You ain’t putting no witch poison in me.” [audience laughing] [chuckles] “Keep your wizard jab away from me.” “I got to watch the video that the Mars robot sent to the world brain I keep it in my pocket.” [audience laughing] “But keep all that science away from me.” If that attitude had existed in 1955, the government would have had to do one of those PSAs, like a little cartoon dancing, hypodermic needle coming out, you know. [audience laughing] “Who do I gotta blow to cure polio?” Like little… [audience laughing] [cheering and applause] Yes. That’s right, jabby. Tell everyone about your benefits. [audience laughs] “My benefits? Your fucking legs work. How’s that for a benefit?” [audience laughs] “You medieval shitheads.” [audience laughing] It’s a different world now, man. It’s a different world. Isn’t it? Cruise ships? Oh, you’ll never see a cruise ship again. Kiss that goodbye. Our grandkids won’t know what a buffet is. Oh. [audience laughs] Fuck, Covid changed everything. First off, every cruise ship is booked up to the year 2026.

              "  't me die near a water slide!” [audience laughing] Not only are buffets gonna come back, they’re gonna come back with this weird, own-the-libs vengeance. Every one of them’s gonna have an agenda. “Come on down to Captain Covid’s Alpha Males Only buffet!” [audience laughing] “You the kind of left-wing soy boy that needs a sneeze guard over your clam chowder, or are you able to fuck your wife?” “Then come on down to Captain Covid’s…” [audience laughing] “You show us proof you ain’t been vaccinated, you get a free platter of room-temperature scallops.” [audience laughing] “That’s right.” [chuckles] Oh… I was listening to ’70s on 7 on the way here. Yeah, on my XM Sirius satellite dial. You like ’70s music? You hit number seven. All the ’70s music you can have, ’70s on 7. You like ’80s music? You hit number eight. [audience laughs] ’80s on 8. Do you like ’90s music? Guess what you hit. Number nine! [audience laughing] Do you like ’40s music? Well, you don’t hit number four. You used to, ’40s on 4. Now, channel 71. ’40s Junction. You like ’50s music? Well, it’s channel 72. ’50s Gold. You like ’60s music? Seventy-three, ’60s Gold. Why did those three channels get moved to the outer rim of the XM Sirius universe? I will tell you why. Their listeners are dying. [audience laughing] ’40s, ’50s, ’60s. Those listeners are dropping like… The fucking ’40s channel has five listeners left. [audience laughing] Three World War II veterans and a couple of contrarian hipsters. That’s it. That’s all that’s left. “You know who’s punk rock? Artie Shaw.” Fuck off. [audience laughing] And we can laugh and enjoy it, but hey, during our lifetimes, ’70s, ’80s, ’90s will go marching up the dial. That’s how you can track how the generations are dying, by where they’re putting the stations. [audience laughing] Keep the ’70s, ’80s, ’90s easy. I hope when they do that, that they take a little time and give some consideration to the names the way they did for the ’40s channel, ’40s Junction, train station, evocative. I get it. Picture in my head. And then they just gave up. ’50s Gold, ’60s… Ah, who care… What? You couldn’t do “Poodle Skirts and Milkshakes”? You couldn’t do “Patchouli Oil and Love Beads,” or whatever? [audience laughing] Give the ’70s channel a name emblematic of the decade. You know, “Your Mother and I Are Separating Radio.” How about that? That’s good',\n",
              "  '. Sure. [audience laughing] Yeah. “Giant Candles Everywhere For Some Reason Tunes.” [audience laughing] The ’80s could be “Trapper Keeper Tunes.” [audience cheering and applauding] And then the ’90s channel could just be… [groans] [audience laughing] [groaning] I don’t know… That was Abra Moore’s “Four-Leaf Clover” on… [groans] [audience laughing] [groans] [audience laughing] Hi. Do you live here in Denver, ma’am? I live in Colorado Springs. [Patton] You live in Colorado Springs? Nice. Thank you for making the drive. [woman] No problem. Okay. What do you… [laughing] Okay, glad I got that straight. It wasn’t a problem. Thank God. Okay. Guys, it wasn’t a problem. It’s cool. [audience laughing] [Patton chuckles] Do you work in Colorado Springs? What do you do? I’m a doctor. [Patton] You’re a doctor. Oh my God, a brainiac. All right, um… What kind of medicine do you practice? I’m a pediatric neurologist. Pediatric neurologist. Oh my God! [audience cheering] You’re like… [cheering and applause] You are serving your community. You are helping children. You have a positive job that you have a positive attitude towards. This is comedy death. I need to get off of you right now. There’s nothing here. [audience laughing] I need to talk to a meth cook or a divorcee. This is… [audience laughs] “I help children live.” [sliding beep] All right. Shit. [audience laughing] Is this, uh… Are you with her? You guys together? Is this the hubby? The husband. The husband.

[audience laughing and applauding] Oh God, if it’s some kind of positive community outreach law, I’m gonna fucking… What kind of law do you practice, sir? I prosecute juvenile sex crimes. You prosecute juvenile sex offenders. Well… [audience laughing] When you say juvenile sex offenders, do you mean people who commit sex offenses against juveniles, or juveniles who are sex offenders? Juveniles who are sex offenders. Juveniles who are sex offenders. Gotta be very careful with the phrasing. And when you say… And then what happens? Like, they get… Why am I…? What is this, a…? I gotta… Me sitting down was good for that one laugh. I’m not gonna do the rest of my show like, “So what do you do?” [audience laughing] What the hell am I doing? [applause] You are prose',\n",

So… [laughs] [audience laughing] That was cute and dark at the same time. Rare to find that. It’s like a goth girl holding a kitten. All right. [audience laughing] How about you? Do you live here in Denver? [man] I do. You do? What do you do in Denver? Uh, I work in a bar and I’m a student. You work in a bar and you’re a student. Oh, it’s a 1980s Tom Hanks movie. All right. So… [audience laughing] What are you studying right now? Uh, cybersecurity. Cybersecurity. And then, by day, he patrols the Internet. At night, it’s Slippery Nipples for secretaries, right? [audience laughing] What, uh… So you’re a bartender, and so do you want to eventually work in cybersecurity? Obviously. [man] Yeah. And the bartending’s paying the bills. Paying for you to learn. What is the… What’s the scariest thing you’ve learned so far in terms of cybersecurity? How close are we to some huge hack attack where suddenly the ATMs don’t work and all of our porn searches are on the internet? When does that happen? [audience laughs] Um… Pretty much nothing is private. [Patton] Pretty much nothing is private. Well, we all know that at this point. That’s not… Oh my God, have you ever… Okay, when you were growing up, was there, like, some asshole that bullied you or was really shitty, and now that you’re learning your cybersecurity skills, you could go digging into this person’s life and just dis-fucking-mantle it if you wanted to? [audience laughing] Has that temptation ever crossed your head? Pretty frequently. Have you… Oh! Have you done searches of old bullies’ names and stuff like that? I’ve… I’ve chosen not to. You’ve chosen not to. [audience laughs] That is a very lawyerly response. That was… Did you catch that? [audience laughing] Oh, man. Is this the wife or girlfriend? Uh, yes. [Patton] Which one? [laughter] Girlfriend. [Patton] Girlfriend! Oh! And what do you do? I’m an educator. [Patton] You’re an educator. And what do you… Thank you. [cheering and applause] Wow.

Or do they make you wear a long sleeve? I bust it all out. [Patton] You bust it all out, sit there… “Let’s get you some fucking credit while you look at The Gashlycrumb Tinies right there, man. There you go.” You got some ink too. How long you been going out? Three years. Four. Three or four years. Three or four years. [audience laughing] Mmm.

Are you gonna… She looks awesome in… And then he can get you, like, free credit card shit and everything. I mean, come on. [audience laughs] It’s a match made in heaven. Make it happen. Couldn’t he use his cybersecurity to get kids free college credit? Change their grades, get them into Harvard. There’s another fucking team-up. All right.

Live in Denver, work in Boulder. What do you do in Boulder? I work for a grocery store. You work for a grocery store. With that facial hair? They’re cool with that or…?

You’re a manager at the grocery store. Do you manage the whole store or one department? Um… Yeah. [audience laughing] Yeah, part of it. Yeah. Part of it. The liquor section? What part do you, um…? [audience laughing] You seem amazed at hearing that you’re working at a grocery store coming out of you. “I work at a grocery store! I…” [audience laughing] [Patton chuckling] And, uh, who are you here with? Is this your friend? There’s your friend. And where do you work? Uh, I work from home. You work from home. [man] In sales.

You call people up or get on the internet with them? On the internet. On the internet. And you try to sell them light bulbs. Absolutely. Individuals or corporations? Both. [Patton] Both.

That’s so fucking interesting. Okay. You two are delightful, and you are not a superhero team. I’m sorry. [audience laughs] That is… I don’t know what the hell you are. There’s a guy who works at a Trader… Doesn’t quite know what he does there. Another guy gets on Zoom calls and sells light bulbs. I think you have a weird OnlyFans. You’re just covering for it now. You don’t really sell light bulbs. [man] It’s the DC Universe. Oh, DC Universe. Very… Oh… I’ll do the nerd shit, my friend. All right. [audience laughing] Don’t you dare!

[audience laughs] Be woke. Be open-minded. Just don’t pat yourself on the back, ’cause it’ll bite you in the ass. Everyone getting cancelled now for not being woke was woke about something, they just couldn’t keep up with progress. Progress will always fucking steamroller you. I’m very pro-trans, very pro-gay marriage, gay rights, and pro-abor… No, no, no. No. No. [cheering and applause] That’s not… What I’m saying is that is going to blow up in my face someday.

              "  'thing that I won’t be able to keep up with. I’ll be like, “I don’t think people should fuck their clones.” “Boo!” There’ll be some weird, like… [audience laughing] “No wait, I’m pro-trans.” “Fuck you, clone hater!” [audience laughing] “No, I’m totally progressive!” #Stopclonehate, then I gotta… Then I’ll double down. “When I grew up, you didn’t jerk off in a test tube and fuck whatever came out of it! If that makes me the bad guy, I’m sorry!” [audience laughing] “Boo!” [Patton chuckles] By the way, that’s how you know if you’re a… uh, if you’re an oppressed minority, or, you know, a fringe group that used to be shit on, and now you know that you’ve made it when straight, white people start asking you if jokes are okay. That’s when you know… The trans community really broke through because all of a sudden, straight, white people’ll be like, “Is this okay?” “Does this joke work? Is that okay?” You know. But either way, that means in the future, straight, white people are gonna be the minority, then they’re gonna have assholes like, “Hey, I’m doing a joke about a straight, white dude, and, um, I have him bowling. Is that okay? You guys bowl, right? Like that’s…” [audience laughing] “It’s not offensive?” “He’s listening to Limp Bizkit, ‘ironically, ‘ okay?” [audience laughing] “It’s ironic. I’m doing it ironically.” [Patton chuckles] Goddamn, these last six years. Holy shit. I was in such a panic in 2016, then all the subsequent years, “What the hell’s going on? Oh my God. Is America coming to an end?” No. You know what? It isn’t. It’s bad right now, but everything that’s happening is supposed to be happening right now. Do you know what 2016 was? It was the boomers’ last temper tantrum. [audience cheering] That’s what that was. [cheering and applause] The boomers’ last temper tantrum. Every time a generation gets old, they panic because death is scary and gross, and they put someone shitty in the White House before they go. This has happened before. The greatest generation… The greatest generation, oh my God, fought the Nazis, saved the world from tyranny, came back, built the suburbs, raised the baby boomers, then they started getting old. Hair turned gray, dick didn’t work anymore, hemorrhoids and hysterectomies. They panicked. Now it’s the late ’70s. Punk music, they don’t know what’s going on. “Fuck this.” “Put the old cowboy movie a',\n",
              "  'ctor in the White House. Yeah, fuck you!” “I was here, goddamn it!” [applause] Then the baby boomers grew up. Think of the baby boomers. They were on the cutting edge of sex, rock and roll, rebellion… They owned youth, and then they got fucking old. [audience laughing] And their hair got gray, and their dick stopped working, hemorrhoids and hysterectomies, fucking Gen X and Gen Z making fun of them on Twitter and TikTok. All this hip-hop music they don’t understand. Now they’re, “Oh my God, I’m about to die. What the fuck is going on?” “Put the racist game show host in the White House. Yeah, fuck you!” “I was here!” [laughter and applause] I’m Gen X. Well, our temper tantrum is going to be beyond ugly. [audience laughing] When we start getting old, our dicks stop working, our hair goes gray, God knows who we’re gonna put in the White House. It’s gonna be either Eddie Vedder or Janeane Garofalo. One of those two. I don’t know. [cheering and applause] Look. I love those guys. Janeane would be a horrible president. [audience laughs] I’ve known her since the ’90s. I love her. She would tell you that herself. Janeane, you should be president. “I’m not doing that shit.” Oh my God, wait a minute. That’s how she’ll win. [audience laughs] Think of how Gen X thinks. Like, “That’s exactly the attitude we need.” [audience laughs] That’s perfect. “No, I’m serious. I’m not doing it.” Yeah, we know, yes. [audience laughing] She’ll blow off a debate. She won’t campaign. She won’t show up to her own inauguration. Yes, that’ll be awesome. We’ll love her even more. CNN will have a ticker on the bottom of the screen, like, “Day 312 of the president not showing up.” [audience laughing] It’ll cut to her in some coffee shop. “I told you I wasn’t gonna run.” [audience laughing] And then we’ll die, and we won’t be here to see what Gen Z puts in the White House. President Logan Paul. I don’t… Look. I don’t know. [audience groaning] President Joe Rogan. [audience groaning] He would… People, listen to me. I’ve also… I’ve known Joe since the ’90s. He is a sweet guy. He has gone off the rails. You know why? ‘Cause someone gave him a hundred million dollars. [audience laughs] That would drive anybody… He’s actually handling it better than I would. [audience laughs] If I had a fucking podcast about knitting and someone gave me a hundred million, I would fuck yarn o',\n",
              "  'n my podcast! [audience laughing] And Joe would be like, “Patton went fucking nuts. Oh my God.” [Patton chuckles] Aging isn’t bad if you don’t take it personally. That’s the key, you know. Treat it like it’s a… Pretend you’re Jeff Goldblum in The Fly, and you’re watching all this weird shit happen. You’re like, “Oh my!” Get a leather-bound notebook. Take notes, you know, late at night, like… “Oh. My farts smell like old books.” “That’s… Hmm.” [audience laughing] “But I’m not eating old books. This…” “This calls for further examination.” [audience laughing] “Day 17. Takes longer to stop peeing than it does to pee.” [audience laughing] It’s coming for all of us. I’m gonna leave you with this story about my, uh… Another breakdown that I had. Foot, all of it, it’s all coming apart. But you know what? We’re living in the 21st century and it’s okay. Always keep that in mind. Last year, last November, I had to have some minor surgery, right? And I’m gonna tell you the story. I’m gonna use a little AP English zhoosh to keep it from being horrifying, ’cause it is. I had to have some minor surgery, the kind of surgery that, um, I’ll put it this way, men my age who sit down a lot have to have. See where I’m going? So… And I’m worried. Still Covid. “Oh my God, what if I get an infection?” But I forgot I live in the 21st century. I have all these advantages in the plus column. On the day of the operation, I summoned a car with my phone. The car came. The guy was masked. I was masked. Car was clean, took me to the hospital. Doctor met me, showed me all the cleanliness protocols they had. He said, “This surgery, we’ve refined it.” “It only takes an hour. You’ll be out for an hour.” “You’ll go home today.” He put me under. I wake up an hour later. Oh my God, I’m fine. He goes, “You are fine.” “Here are some cutting-edge painkillers to help you with your recovery.” “You won’t feel a thing.” “Now take out your phone and summon another car.” “You live in the 21st century.” And I did, and the car took me home. And when I got home, I had a device onto which I could call, from the air, movies, books, television shows, music to entertain me while I recovered. Twenty-first century. When I left the hospital, the doctor said, “There’s a certain bodily function, that you’re used to doing every day.” “And for the next few days, you’re not gonna do it.” [audienc',\n",
              "  'e laughs] “And then, after three or four days, all of a sudden, you will do it.” [audience laughing] “But the first time you do it, it will be doing you.” [audience laughing] “There’s no shame in it.” “It’s gonna happen, part of the recovery.” “Go heal in peace.” I go home. First day, I watch movies. I read books on my iPad. I go to sleep. Nothing happens. Next day, watch movies, read books on my iPad, go to sleep. Nothing happens. Third day, watch movies, read books on my iPad, go to sleep. 3:30 in the morning. [audience laughing] It happens. But I wake up as it’s happening and I can feel it coming. I’m half a second ahead of it. Oh my goodness, it’s not gonna be a disaster. I hop out of bed. Everything’s okay. I make it across the bedroom floor. I get into the bathroom. I’m ten feet away from the toilet. I’m gonna make it. [sings suspenseful melody] Boom! No. [audience laughing] I had managed to get my underwear and sweatpants off. [audience laughing] Which made things ten times worse. [audience laughing] Because now, our pristine white-tile bathroom… [audience laughing] …was decorated for autumn. How about that, huh? Yeah. [audience laughing] Happy Thanksgiving. So… [audience laughing] I’m standing there going, “Oh my God, I’ve got two choices. I can either clean myself off, or risk my wife coming in and seeing this disaster, which she doesn’t deserve.” So, I do the second choice. I clean up everything first. I get a bunch of towels. I get everything all cleaned up in a big, gross wad. I gotta take off all my clothes, including my shirt. I’d ruined my shirt. [audience laughing] Physics. So… [audience laughing] Take the whole wad down to the… And I’m nude now. Go down to the kitchen with this big wad of horror, take the bag out of the can, put this in the bag. Now, four in the morning, I gotta walk to the end of my driveway where the trash cans are. Get the thing open. Drop it. And I just stand there. [audience laughing] Nude. [audience laughing] 4:00 in the morning. And I just looked at the moon. [audience laughing] Like, hours ago, I was in the 21st century… [audience laughing] …with access to cutting-edge technology, medicine, transportation. And now, just a mere couple of hours later, I had been revealed as the naked ape I always was. [audience laughing] [applause] [cheering and applause] The naked, shit-covered ape that’s insi',\n",
              "  'de all of us. And I actually had a weird moment of peace, ’cause it was so awful, and I’m just like, “You know what? I’m actually as far away from the 21st century as I could possibly be right now.” “I’m actually closer to my Neanderthal forebears.” “There’s something weirdly cleansing about this.” And I had that feeling for, like, ten seconds. That’s when I remembered all my neighbors have ring cameras on their doors. [audience laughing] So everybody got their Christmas card that year. Thank you so much, Denver!

Reflecting on his journey, he humorously acknowledges the necessity to leave hard drugs behind. His routine includes comical anecdotes about ketamine escapades and inventing a fictitious Italian sleep aid called “Melatone,” as well as recounting awkward moments like being high at Aretha Franklin’s funeral. Davidson doesn’t shy away from critiquing Apple’s rental service and openly discusses his mother’s midlife crisis and his futile efforts to nudge her back into the dating world. Davidson’s comedic style, marked by self-mockery and bursts of unfiltered truthfulness, ventures into both contentious and darker subjects with ease. He openly discusses his battles with drugs, the challenges of fame, and mental health issues. The special is a blend of humor and poignant reflection, showcasing Davidson’s unique ability to intertwine the complexities of adulthood, fame, and personal evolution. * * * Transcript [flicking lighter] [announcer speaking indistinctly behind doors] [audience cheering in distance] [announcer] Ladies and gentlemen, get ready for Pete Davidson! [door opens] [audience cheering loudly] [door closes] [Pete] I just, uh… I just turned 30 this week, so yeah. [audience cheering] No, it’s over, dude. It’s over. I just, uh… I had to stop doing hard drugs ’cause you can’t… can’t be a drug addict in your thirties. I’m not that guy. You know that guy that can just do one bump of coke? He’s like, “Oh, I’m so bad!” [audience laughs] Or that guy who’ll have two beers, like, “I might have diarrhea tomorrow.” You’re like, “Fuck you, dude, you fuckin’…” Doing drugs in your twenties is fine. There’s an excuse. You’re like, “I’m finding myself.” You know? It’s cute, you know? Do a little bump off an iPad with your friends? It’s adorable. Say cute things like, “I’m a crispy little dolphin.” You know? All your boys are like… [makes dolphin sounds] You know? Then one of your boys has a kid, and you’re holding it, you’re like, “I think I’m a drug addict. I think I need some help.” I was on a magical drug for the last two-and-a-half, three y',\n",
              "  'ears, called ketamine. It was amazing. What a time! [audience howls] I thought of amazing ideas, great ideas. Like, uh, an Italian sleep aid called [in heavy Italian accent] Melatone. Sorry. [audience laughs] [chuckles] Sorry. So dumb. You go to sleep right away with [in heavy Italian accent] Melatone. Sorry. No prescription. Some guy just gives it to you under a bridge and kisses you on the cheek. [audience laughs] [in heavy Italian accent] “Take one when you hit the turnpike. Alright, hey.” Sorry. If you don’t know ketamine, you probably did it accidentally if you’re a coke head. Yeah. You’ll be doing coke all night. You’ll do one bump, and be like, “Whoa.” “This is not cocaine.” “Also, am I gay?” [audience laughs] It’s embarrassing when you’re not on ketamine anymore. You’re like, “Ooh.” “Ugh!” “I’m embarrassed. I was out and about like that. That’s not cool.” You know? I was at funerals like that. That’s fucked up, right? I was at Aretha Franklin’s funeral like that. Yeah, I have to live with that. She’ll never know, but still, it’s not the point. If she was there, she’d probably be like, “Hey! Who are you and what the fuck are you doing at my funeral?” It’s embarrassing. I was so high I thought it was a good idea to say to her family, “Hey, I’m just here to pay my R-E-S-P-E-C-Ts.” [audience laughs] Yes. I started renting movies on Apple. Fuck Apple and their rental service! Scumbags! They’re like the mafia, those fucking assholes. They’re such assholes as a company. Did I buy the new phone? Of course, but… fuck them! They’re like the mob. Like, “You’re not getting our new phone? Okay.” “Guess whose phone’s at 43% forever. Fuck you.” “Every day of your life is now a guess, my friend.” “You just buy your new dream car? Save up?” Oh, great. Charger port’s different. Yeah. Every time you get a blow job now, you gotta be like, “Sorry, they got a new charger. Sorry about that.” “Yeah, I know. Apple! I know.” Sorry. Scumbags! You ever go to rent a movie on Apple, and it’s $4.99 to buy and $3.99 to rent? And you’re like, “Fuck you, dude!” Really? You’re going to make me own Jeepers Creepers 2? You fucking assholes! I don’t know. My mom’s having a midlife crisis. Uh, yeah, she’s really far up my ass right now. You know, she’s 55. She hasn’t been with anybody since my dad died. So it’s been like 23',\n",
              "  ' years since she’s, you know, spread ’em, I guess. I don’t know. She called me, having a midlife crisis. She was like, “I want to get a facelift.” I was like, “For what? You don’t even use your face.” [audience laughs] I’d get it if she was out getting tagged or something. You know, what you getting a facelift for? To watch Grey’s Anatomy? [audience laughs] [in high-pitched voice] “I love Eric Dane.” Yeah, my mom won’t fucking date. I’m trying to get her to date. She was like, “Your father was my man.” You know? [woman] Aw. No! It… “Aw” at first. It’s been 20 years of this fuckin’ Nicholas Sparks bullshit. I’m tired of it. I’m tired of it! She needs to get out there. Okay? She needs to sign up to Hinge or fucking Bumble. Whatever the fucking… The one the ladies get to choose. Whatever. Girls are so cute. They’re like, “It’s cool! We get to choose who comes on our face.” Anyway, um… [audience laughs] “Ain’t that nice?” She needs to get out there ’cause all that weird energy that’s supposed to be on a cock goes to me and my sister, okay? And it’s fucking weird. I’ll go over to my mom’s. I’ll hang out, eat dinner for an hour, and she’s like, “Where you going?” I’m like, “Home. What do you mean?” Unless we’re about to fuck in the shower, I don’t… My duties as a son are done. [audience laughs] It’s to the point where I might fuck her just to get her off my back. [audience laughs] Yeah, that’s right. “Maybe you’re just not as good of a son as you think you are, huh?” I’m the fucking son of the century right here! Give me my ribbon! If I fuck my mom over Thanksgiving, my grandpa would kiss my forehead, and go, “I heard what you did for your mother. You’re a good son.” “She’s smiling finally, hey.” She needs to get out there. I’m trying to find her a suitor. Someone to fuck my mom, that’s a difficult thing. You want it to be good but you want the guy to be good. And that’s… You know, that’s a rarity. You want the type of guy that fucks her missionary-only. But still makes her come twice, rolls over. Hands her the remote, goes, “Heard Dancing with the Stars is on.” You know, that guy. Where is that guy? My mom’s a good catch. 55, hasn’t been with anyone in 23 years. It’s like fucking brand-new down there. Refurbished iPhone, right? You know? Screen cracks. “Should I get a new one?” “No, send it to this',\n",
              "  ' weird company called Insureon.” In three weeks, you get it back, and when you charge it, it’s all weird, but it gets the job done pretty much. That’s my mom’s pussy, dude! Fifty-five, hasn’t been with anyone in 23 years. Brand-new down there. She’s like a classic car. She’s like a ’68 Mustang with like 2,000 original miles on it. All original interior. You go to the dealer, get behind the wheel, like, “Where the fuck’s this been hiding?” “It’s brand-new in here! What’s its story?” Then the guy’s like, “Well, some old guy had it and died.” “And his son kept it in the garage for 23 years.” “But better make a move fast.” “I hear the son’s thinking of keeping it for himself.” [audience laughs] “Hey, I like the way she drives.” “This thing is priceless to me.” My mom was a single mom, you know. But all moms are single moms, you know, right? You know you’re alone, right? My mom was so tired all the time. And now that I look back, horny apparently. “Horny and tired.” So, like, I-I-I never wanted to tell her any of my troubles, because she had no time for anything. And any time I told her a problem, she always had one solution. She’d be like, “You should take a nap.” No matter the severity of the situation. That’s the type of person my mom is. In complete denial. Both my wrists could be cut, and I could be holding a knife. Like, [in screeching voice] “I don’t wanna be here!” She’d be like, “Have you slept today? You look tired.” She’s that type of mom, you know. And I remember I had a huge problem when I was ten. I thought I was gay, you know. I was wrong, but I thought, at ten, because I was obsessed with Leonardo DiCaprio, I was in love. Yes. I was into girls too, but I’m from Staten Island. In 2002, no girl was hotter than Leonardo DiCaprio in Staten Island. What a piece of ass he was, oh my God. He still gets pussy today based off what he looked like in 2002. He is the GOAT. I hope he never gets married. Running the best catch and release program the universe has ever seen. Leave him alone. I hope one day I get invited to the big yacht in the sky. With Tobey Maguire and sometimes Emile Hirsch, you know. “Matching Dodger hats, chicks half our age, guts going.” He don’t give a fuck. Leonardo DiCaprio don’t give a fuck. He’s all schleppy. He’s not even in shape. He’s all fucking fat, slowly morphing',\n",
              "  ' into Jack Nicholson. He don’t give a shit. Walking around on his yacht, looking at babes. Going, “Hey, uhh, I still fuck.” “Uhh!” “Uhh! I still fuck. Uhh!” “I make one movie so good every three years, I just get to fuck. Uhh!” “The ice caps are melting. Uhh!” So when I was ten, I was on my porch all gay, thinking about this guy. Fresh off of a double-VHS of Titanic. “Spit in my mouth, Jack,” I would say. [audience laughs] “Let’s fog up a Model T together.” My dream is to be Fabrizio. [audience laughs] You know, that’s my dream in real life. ‘Cause Fabrizio was Leonardo’s best friend and then he died. That’s my dream, dude. [audience laughs] [chuckles] So I remember I was sitting on my porch, you know, and I was like, “How am I going to tell my mom I’m gay?” You know what I mean? My mom’s an Irish Catholic Staten Island mom. She didn’t tell me I was Jewish till I was 25, and that’s because I found out. I did a 23andMe or ancestry, whatever. One of my boys did it. He came back Neanderthal. And he was talking all this weird Neanderthal shit. He was like, “I’m Neanderthal, actually the rarest fucking…” [mumbles] I was like, “You’re sill a dork. You’re still a fucking stupid dork.” But he was talking all this shit, I was like, “I got to get swabbed. Maybe I’m Neanderthal or something.” And it came back, I was like 50% Jewish. And I called my mom, ’cause I was raised Catholic and… [mimics chanting] All that forever. You know. I was like, “Mom, am I Jewish?” She was like, “Yeah.” [audience laughs] So how am I going to tell her I’m gay? So I was sitting on my porch all gay. My mom pulls up, right? Slams the car door. She looks at me, goes, “What’s wrong?” I go “Nothing.” She says, “No, what’s wrong?” I guess she noticed I looked a little gay. I go, “I think I’m gay.” She goes, “Are you tired?” And I go, “No, I’m just… I don’t think sleeping fixes homosexuality.” Imagine if it did? Imagine if gays are just tired. Elton John must be exhausted. [audience laughs] She goes, “Why do you think you’re gay?” I go, “‘Cause of Leonardo DiCaprio.” She goes, “That’s not gay.” I go, “It is. I have posters of him in my room.” Like Titanic and the beach. Not even the movie The Beach, just him on the beach. With Tobey, you know? Matching Dodger hats, you know? She goes, “That’s not gay.” “Yes, it is.” Right there, th',\n",
              "  'at was too long of a problem for my mom. She just snaps. She just goes, “All right! You wanna know if you’re gay, Peter?” I’m like, “Whoa, what the fuck is this, a circus all of a sudden?” “Step right up! My son the queer!” I was like… [audience laughs] I’m like “Relax, we have neighbors. They’re starting to gather.” She goes, “This is how you know you’re gay. Let me ask you this.” “Do you want to suck his dick?” I don’t know what that means. I’m ten. I just don’t answer. She goes, “Do you want to suck his dick?” And I just keep going… ’cause I don’t know what that is. She goes, “Pull his pants down, grab his dick, you know, put it in your mouth till it expands.” I was like, “What? Expands? What the fuck are you talking about?” I’m ten! I got a baby button cock at the time. ♪ Baby button cock Little weird boy cock ♪ [audience laughs] It expands? What the fuck you talking about? She goes, “Do you wanna get fucked from behind, Peter?” “By Leonardo DiCaprio?” “Do you want to look behind you and Leonardo DiCaprio’s behind you, puts his dick in your butthole, it expands?” I was like, “You gotta stop with the expansion thing.” I’m ten, it’s 2002. Only expansion I’m aware of, Houston Texans are now in the NFL. That is it! I don’t know about cock expansion, Mom. She goes, “You get fucked from behind by Leonardo.” “And he’s going to town, and he mushes your face in the pillow.” “You’re down there for 20 seconds, and then you look up, and all of a sudden, Leonardo’s outside the window waving at you.” “You’re confused, ’cause you’re still getting fucked from behind.” “And then you look behind you, and it’s Tobey Maguire! Tobey Maguire!” “Is that what you want?” I was like, “Sounds like you need a nap, and that’s what you want, psychopath.” I just said, “No!” And she goes, “Not gay.” [audience laughs] This is going to sound weird. I don’t like doing Make-A-Wishes. Um… [audience laughs] Just ’cause they’re sad, that’s all. By the way, not getting a lot of offers, might add. Believe it or not, it’s not a lot of people’s dying wish to meet me. It’s usually their wish for me to die, actually. Complete opposite. There’s a foundation for that. I don’t like doing them ’cause they’re sad, that’s all. They make me really sad, especially when you’re in a k-hole. When you’re on ketamine, and they say, “This kid is s',\n",
              "  'ick.” You’re like, “I know.” “And I’m pretty sure I could cure him.” [audience laughs] “Listen to Alan Watts and put on The Last Dragon. Let’s go.” Sorry. They’re just sad, that’s all. The Make-A-Wish Foundation called, “We got one for you!” I was like, “That’s a weird way to go about it.” Right? I don’t know the right one, but… Not like, “Hey, we caught one! Real sicko! A real sick one.” “That’s what we do.” They call me, “His name’s Kevin, he’s dying of cancer.” I said, “That’s so sad. I’m sorry.” They’re like, “His dying wish is to meet you.” I said, “Is it brain cancer?” [audience laughs] So I set it up. They ask, “Do you want to do this?” I was like, “Yeah, I just drove into a house, I could use good press.” [audience laughs] In my defense, that house cut me off, all right? That fucking… Just fucking… They didn’t put that in the article. So I’m nervous, because I’m not a good Make-a-Wish guy candidate. If there was a Make-a-Wish video game, I wouldn’t be a character you could select. Like, “Pete Davidson!” You know? It wouldn’t be me. You know who’s good at that? Johnny Depp. Johnny Depp comes in dressed as Captain Jack Sparrow. He’s like, “Hello, children.” [mumbles] And the kids are laughing, and the nurses are wet. It’s fucking awesome. They’re fucking all, like, soaked. He’s good, you know? Or John Cena, the wrestler. He’s amazing. I think he’s done the most ever. God bless him. He comes in. He has, like, a championship belt. He’s all wrestlery. He’s like, “What’s up, son? How you doing, champ?” The kid’s like, “Oh!” And then he’s like, “Wanna hold my belt?” “Huh? Wanna hold my belt?” I’m watching, like, “I don’t have a belt. What am I going to do? I got nothing.” Give him my phone and say, “Scroll to the right”? “Want to see some ass, dude? Fuck yeah.” “Yeah, she’s cool, dude.” “She’s actually your doctor.” Anyway… [audience laughs] So I was all nervous, you know, ’cause I want to show up for this kid. I want to kill it, you know. The Make-A-Wish, not actually… That would be easier. Wouldn’t that be great? You get murdered by your favorite celeb. “It’s been great. Yep.” Bang! [audience laughs] So I was thinking, “What’s my belt?” I want to crush this. This is a huge deal. I want to do well. And I was like, “Ooh.” I was like, “Okay, let’s think about it.” The kid is going to die, righ',\n",
              "  't? That’s… No, I’m not being a dick. That’s just what a Make-A-Wish is. That’s all. Otherwise, why would you hang out with a kid for three hours? That’s weird, you know. You’d be a pedophile, actually. Ironically, for a pedophile, that would be their Make-a-Wish, you know? Hang out with a dying, weak one, you know? [audience laughs] Yeah, I don’t give a fuck. I was molested, so I can make those jokes. I don’t give a shit, so there you go. [audience cheers] I’m not saying that to be cool. I just don’t have the Internet. I don’t do interviews. I don’t wanna be like, “Well, actually…” [audience laughs] I was like, “This kid’s gonna die, there’s nothing I can do.” Right? But what I could do, I could tell him all of my secrets. Right? I have a lot of secrets. I don’t kiss and tell ’cause I’m an old-school broad. I keep it to the chest, and I hope God gets you. That’s how I roll. I have a lot of secrets, things I can’t tell my friends or my therapist, ’cause I don’t trust them, you know. And I’m pretty sure one of them works for the Daily Mail. [audience laughs] But I was like, “I can tell this kid ’cause it’s not going anywhere.” It’s like a sure thing. Very few things in life are sure. It’s kinda nice, you know. So that’s what I did. I hung out with him for three hours, sung like a canary. Told him everything. “This guy’s actually cool, this guy’s not.” “This guy’s in the Illuminati, this guy needs to be burned to come.” One of those is me, and I won’t tell you which one. We had an amazing time. He was so happy. I was so happy. A huge weight was lifted off of me too. I got to tell him some stuff, get some stuff off my chest. It was great, beautiful. He hugged me. He said, “That was so much fun. I’ll see you around.” I was like, “Well, I don’t know about that, but… you know…” I was like, “Godspeed, little man, you know.” How cool was that? Hit him with a “Godspeed.” Huh? How often do you get to do that in life? I remember driving home, like, “Godspeed, you motherfucker. That’s pretty cool.” “What are you, Magnum PI? That was awesome.” And I felt great. And then a week went by, and I went on the Make-A-Wish website, and the kid was still alive. [audience laughs] [audience laughs] Started getting a little nervous. I don’t know who this kid knows. So I called up the foundation, check up on him, you kn',\n",
              "  'ow. Make sure no miracles are afoot. [audience laughs] Hey, I held up my end! I was promised a dead child! [audience laughs] I’m tired of people lying to me! So I call up the fucking Make-A-Liars. I go, “Hey, you fucking lying sacks of shit.” They go, “Who is this?” I go, “It’s Pete Davidson.” They go, “Kevin was just telling us what a wonderful time he had.” I go, “I had a great time too.” “He said you really shared a lot.” I go, “Oh fuck, did he?” I guess a pinky promise means dick to Kevin. I go, “How’s he doing?” They go, “Well, not well, but there’s always hope.” I go. “Yeah, well, how much? How much hope do you think? ‘Cause if cancer don’t get him, I will, at this point. He knows too much. They go “We appreciate your concern.” I go, “Oh, I’m very, very concerned.” “You let me know when it happens.” They go, “We will.” Hung up. Next week, I was freaking out a little bit. Just looking at the phone. And then, you know, finally. Yeah. [audience laughs] They called, you know, and, uh, yeah. Wish fulfilled. [audience laughs] Joke over, he dies. That’s it. There is no happy ending. It is a happy ending, in that it’s exactly what was supposed to happen. I was watching Chappelle specials, and I noticed… Yeah, he’s the best. I noticed when he’s crushing and having a good time, he’ll be like, “Aah!” That actually hurt a little bit. Chappelle got some thick legs doing that. I was like, “I wish I had one of those things, where I’m crushing, and I get to…” Whatever that… Maybe when I’m doing well, I-I-I-I’ll go like this. “Wish fulfilled.” [audience laughs] Maybe… Maybe I’ll carry around packing peanuts in my pocket, and after a punchline, I’ll be like… [audience laughs] It’s been a very sad year. I lost my stalker. I think that’s sad, you know? You really don’t know what you got till it’s gone. [audience laughs] You know, I remember when I first met my stalker. She was outside my house. It’s weird when you get a stalker, ’cause there’s two parts of your brain. First time you get a stalker, you’re like, “Oh my God, this is so weird and scary.” But there’s the other part of your brain, “I guess I’m doing well.” [giggles] Then you get a good look at your stalker, and you’re like, “Maybe not so well, huh?” I’ll never forget. I met her. She was outside my house, wearing a shirt with my face on it. And it',\n",
              "  ' wasn’t even a flattering photo. It was like blown up and warped. My eyes were all over. It was like a nightmare. It was so… It insulted me. It was so bad. I wanted to go up to her and be like, “Hey.” “If you’re ever going to do this, like, here’s five photos of myself that I like, okay?” So, you know, I pull up, she’s out there. She’s a stalker, so, you know. Not hot, you know? That’s what you picture when you picture a stalker. Not hot. If they were hot, they wouldn’t be a stalker, they’d be my girlfriend. So… yeah. “How much do you love me? We’ll figure it out. Get up there.” So I’m outside, right? And I pull up, and she’s there. And I don’t have a gun, right? But she doesn’t know that, right? So I was watching a lot of SVU at the time, and when they’re approaching the perp, they get out of the car, they show their gun, and they usually put it in their jacket like this, and they walk to let ’em know they got one, but not to alarm people. And I didn’t have a gun, but she don’t fucking know that, right? So I made a finger gun, and I put it in my pocket like this. And I started walking towards her, okay? So I’m looking at her like this. And she’s kind of smiling at me. She’s kinda… I was like, “Why is she smiling?” Then I was like, “Oh. She thinks I have a boner.” Okay, yeah. This is like her Make-A-Wish. This is… And I literally went, “Not a boner, just a finger gun,” which I think is worse. I should have just had a boner, to be honest with you. ‘Cause now I’m a loser in front of my own stalker, and I’m… Now she’s winning. Now I’m bothering her in a weird way. So, I go, “What are you doing here?” And I don’t know where to look ’cause I’m on her shirt, and I’m all over the place. And she’s… I’m a little scared to talk to her, so I’m just, like, confused. I said, “What are you doing here?” And she just said, “I love you!” You know. I was like, “That’s very nice, but you can’t be here.” And she goes, “Why?” I was like, “I don’t know, it’s never gotten this far, to be honest.” Usually you go, “Get the fuck out.” People say, “Sorry!” I didn’t expect someone to challenge. I was like, “I don’t know, you just can’t be here.” And she was like, “Why?” I was like… I don’t… I don’t know where to go. I was trying to think what to say, and then I was thinking about it. She seemed a little nuts, you know? Y',\n",
              "  'ou know, I… I’m crazy. So crazy people could, you know… Like, we can tell. She’s definitely a little nuts. She’s, you know… First of all, look at the shirt, you know. You know. And she’s stalking me, you know what I mean? That’s… So I felt a little bad. I was like, “You got to be nice and careful with the situation,” right? So I told her. I was like… I kind of went elementary school on her. I went like, “Hey.” I was like, “You can’t be here because this is where I go poopy.” [audience laughs] And after I said that, a little light flickered in her eye, like she was a Who from Whoville. She was… She was like, “What?” I said, “Yeah, I go poopy here.” She goes, “Ugh.” “You wouldn’t want to be here while I’m doing that.” And she goes, “No!” I got a little embarrassed. I was like, “Why? You’d be so lucky.” “You’d be so lucky if you were around my poopy.” She said “What?” I was like, “Never mind. Yeah, you shouldn’t come here.” “I could be pooping and that’s gross.” “And I have Crohn’s, so it could be a war zone up there.” And she was like, “Okay, I’m sorry. I won’t ever come back here.” Then she left. Right? I thought the problem was solved. No, that is just our first encounter. Okay? It’s a very long story, so buckle in. Also, I do have Crohn’s. I told people I had Crohn’s when I was like 19, 20, ’cause I had it really bad, and then now it’s mostly fine, like, 90% of the time. Uh, but like, I… It’s weird. I don’t like telling people that, like, ’cause I got good meds ’cause things are going all right, so I’m doing okay… But the reason why I thought… that’s a gross thing to say, but I have to say it because people come up to me outside, and try to bond with me over Crohn’s. And it’s just like… Not even at the bathroom, you know what I mean? I’ll just be in line at a store, and someone’ll come up to me and be like, “Hey!” “Me too.” [audience laughs] And I’m like “What?” And they just go, “Yeah.” “I got a poopy butthole as well.” “Name’s Phil.” I’m like, “Ugh! Fuck it.” I don’t have the heart to say, “I don’t have your Crohn’s.” I’m like the Magic Johnson of Crohn’s. Okay, so… I go out of town, right? My mom and my mom’s 79-year-old friend Terry are watching my house. Terry is a girl. My mom told me I have to tell people that Terry is a girl after a show once. She was like, “Terry could also be a guy’',\n",
              "  's name, and we love Terry, and if this comes out, and people start…” “We don’t want anyone to think she’s a guy so you should say that she’s a girl.” And I said, “Hey, Mom.” “Nobody gives a fuck about you or Terry.” [audience laughs] So my mom and my mom’s 79-year-old female friend Terry are watching… Yeah, now the joke’s gonna work! They’re watching my house, okay? My mom is oblivious to reality. She’s a very smart lady, but she’s just… She’s one of those moms that’s always like, “Really? No!” Just doesn’t believe anything. I told her. I said, “Someone knows where we live.” “Someone could come over and hurt you.” And she goes, “No. No, they’re looking for you.” “They’re not gonna… They’re not gonna hurt me.” I’m like, “That’s fair, but could you humor me? This is scary.” And I was like, “There’s someone… I have a stalker.” “And you just gotta be aware in case she comes by.” She goes, “All right. What does she look like?” I was like, “You’ll know. Trust me. Unmistakable. Okay?” So I go out of town. Okay, stalker comes back, she rings the doorbell. My mom answers and goes, [high-pitched voice] “Hey, who are you?” That’s what my mom sounds like, by the way. Like an Adam Sandler Hubie Halloween character. [in high-pitched voice] “How you doing?” So fellas, imagine that while you’re tagging it. [in high-pitched voice] “Ooh!” She’ll probably say things like, “Ooh, thank you! Thank you!” She’s been out the game so long, she don’t know dirty… “Thanks, sir!” So my mom goes, “Hey, who are you?” Stalker goes, “I’m Pete’s friend.” My mom, of course, goes, “Well, come on in.” [audience laughs] Stalker proceeds to watch Grey’s Anatomy with my mom and Terry for three hours. Three hours goes by, my mom finally thinks, “Maybe I should call Peter.” “See if he’s coming by to hang out with his friend.” She calls me, goes, “Hey, where are you?” I go, “London.” She goes, “Oh, well, your friend’s here.” I go, “Is she hot?” And my mom goes, [in high-pitched voice] “Eh…” And I go, “You’re under attack!” [audience laughs] “Run for your fucking life!” I go, “Very important. Go to the garage and call the cops.” “But pretend like nothing’s wrong, okay?” Now, I hope none of this ever happens to any of you, but I did get to hear my mom act on the phone. Which is priceless for me. My mom is always like, “Put me in your stuf',\n",
              "  'f.” I was like, “All right, make it to the garage.” You make it… You make it to the garage, you get an audition or something, yeah. My mom goes to the garage, I go, “Call my boy.” Don’t know if anybody has a boy like this. A friend you’ve been friends with for a decade. You do drugs almost every day together, then you don’t see him for three months, then the next time you see him, he’s just a cop. [audience laughs] And you’re like, “Tasty?” He’s like, “Uh-huh! Officer Tasty now.” You know? Better change your name in my phone to Officer Tasty. So Tasty goes over. I’m on speakerphone now with Tasty, my mom, and my stalker. Female Terry fled, okay? [audience laughs] Tasty goes, “We got her. What do you want me to do?” I was like, “You’re the cop.” He goes, “I have her in handcuffs.” I go, “Very good. That’s good.” He goes, uh, “She’s holding a present.” I go, “Okay.” I was like, “Open it.” He goes “What?” I go, “Open it.” He goes, “Why?” I go, “It’s a present.” What do you mean? She’s a stalker. She probably knows me pretty good, you know. Probably a good gift. I dunno. I get a lot of shitty gifts. She might… He goes, “Bro, it could be a bomb!” I go, “Dude, she can’t make a bomb.” “She can’t even make a t-shirt. You think she’s gonna fucking… put a bomb together, dude?” He goes, “All right.” I’m on speakerphone. I just hear this… [mimics scraping sound] And then my boy just goes, “Oh!” “No!” “Bro!” “This is disturbing!” Which is a very big word for Tasty. He’s never pulled the three syllables before. [audience laughs] I go, “What is it?” He goes, “Bro, it’s 20 pairs of soiled underwear.” [audience laughs] Fuck you! No one’s ever done that for you. Don’t talk about my girl like that. Only I can. You wish your girl gave you 20 pairs of dookie drawers. Yeah. It’s fucking thoughtful. I called my girl, like, “You gotta step it up!” “You never even met female Terry.” [audience laughs] Twenty pairs? Yes, it’s gross, but it’s thoughtful. One pair is gross. One pair is a hit. That’s a fuck you. “Here’s my shit.” You know what I mean? Twenty pairs is a crime of passion. [audience laughs] Yeah, it’s crazy, but then again so is love. I have Crohn’s. Maybe she was trying to communicate through some weird fecal matter thing. I don’t know, she’s bonkers. Twenty pairs? That’s thoughtful. That takes time. You can',\n",
              "  '’t knock out 20 pairs of doody drawers in one day. Even if you had diarrhea, by the 11th pair, it’d be a little light. [audience laughs] I like to think it was a day at a time. I do, every night. I like to think about it. I like to picture, you know? She comes home from a long day of eating Hot Pockets on an Acer computer, right? She runs upstairs, you know. She starts undressing, you know, in front of the wall of Pete. It’s all posters of me, but she don’t know how to make posters, so I’m all just… [audience laughs] …everywhere. She puts on a sexy song. Well, sexy to her. So like “Mambo No. 5” or some shit. [chuckles] She starts the séance, lights a candle, blows it out with a fart, you know, gets it going. She looks up at me. I’m looking at her somewhere. And she plants ’em. ♪ One, two, three-four-five ♪ [audience laughs] [hums Lou Bega’s “Mambo No. 5”] [makes a loud farting noise] ♪ …gin and juice But I really don’t wanna… ♪ [makes loud farting noises] She fucking gives a noogie, gets a good fucking… And then she fucking, “Kobe!” Right into a little box for me. She goes, “Oooh!” [in high-pitched voice] “Nineteen to go, poopy surprise for Petey! Woo-hoo!” It’s my fantasy, and I’ll jerk off to it if I want to! [audience laughs] Tasty goes, “What do you want me to do?” I go, “Get rid of her!” “Keep one of those pairs.” Sorry. So now I got to get a restraining order, so that means I have to go to court. Tell a bunch of, you know, officials I’m afraid of this lady. So I’m at court, about to go in, Tasty comes back to me. He goes, “I just spoke to your girlfriend.” I go, “Fuck you!” You know? “What did she say?” You know? [audience laughs] He goes, “She’s not going to be able to be here today.” “She’s going to be on the iPad.” And I go, “What the fuck? What do you mean she won’t be here?” She’s a stalker, her job is to show up. What do you mean? Is she trying to get in my head or something? ‘Cause it’s working. It’s… I’m a little sad. You know, ’cause that… that dookie surprise was thoughtful. Though gross, you know. So I was a little excited to see her, a little bit, you know. I didn’t try to look hot or anything, but I picked an outfit. You know, yeah. Hell yeah! You know? An outfit that said, like, “Hey.” “Don’t give up.” You know? [audience laughs] “Some things are worth fighting for.” Restra',\n",
              "  'ining order, shmestraining shorder. I go, “What happened, Tasty?” “What happened to my girl?” He goes, “Bro, she was deemed unfit to stand trial.” Deemed unfit to stand up at a trial. That means a bunch of medical professionals and officers of the law saw her and were like, “No.” I immediately felt insulted. It’s a little fucked up and embarrassing for me, don’t you think? “Deemed unfit”? I don’t think you understand how insane that is. Let me put it in perspective for you. Jeffrey Dahmer was deemed fit… [audience laughs] …to stand trial. A guy who murdered and ate gay people. One chick is into me, off to the nuthouse! [audience laughs] Are you fucking kidding me? That’s ridiculous. Killing and eating gays and poopy pants aren’t the same! First time in my life I was like, “I gotta vote!” [audience laughs] “System is corrupt.” Tasty goes, “There’s one more thing. She said you guys had been communicating.” I go, “Dude, I swear…” He goes, “Telepathically.” I was like, “Whew!” [exhales] Thought they found my burner. He goes, “Telepathically, you know.” “She said that you actually told her to come over with your mind.” I go, “Whoa, that’s fucked up.” And then he left, and I was alone, and I was a little sad, and I was in my cool outfit. I just had a moment of honesty, and I was just like… “Hello.” [audience laughs] “I miss you.” [chuckles] “You weren’t supposed to tell anybody that we could do this.” “Also you were supposed to kill Terry and my mom so we get the house.” “I got your panties in my pocket.” “Ziploc’ed to preserve the stench.” [laughs] So I go to trial, I win, you know, which is nice. I never win in life. [chuckles] Judge comes up to me, and he goes, “She fits the requirements for prison.” I go, “What?” He goes, “Do you want to send her to prison?” I go, “No, I just want her off my lawn.” Like Gran Torino, you know? “Get off my lawn!” [mumbles] But no big deal. Just… restraining order, you know? But restrain her to the upper deck, so she can still pay for shit. You know what I mean? Come to shows. He goes, “You don’t want her arrested?” I go, “No.” He goes, “That’s very noble of you.” I went, “Thank you, sir.” And then he goes, “We will do plan B then.” And he just smacks the hammer, and everybody’s… I was like, “Whoa, wait. What’s plan B?” He goes, “It’s nothing.” “We’re gonna sentenc',\n",
              "  'e her to like six months, in a mental rehab facility.” I was like, “What? That’s not safe.” “That’s like the one place I’d bump into her.” [audience laughs] Might as well sentence her to Dave & Buster’s while you’re at it. Rehab’s like Cheers for me. It’s where everybody knows my name. A month went by, I got the restraining order. Didn’t really hit me till the first time I pulled up to my house, and no one was there. And I went, “Oh.” I was reminiscing with my mom. I was like, “Remember she’d be out there.” “Remember?” “Remember for Christmas once, she sent us all those cookies, and we made female Terry eat them first… [audience laughs] …to make sure they were good?” So I started missing her a little bit, you know. So once in a while, I’d be like, “Hello. Where are you?” And she wasn’t receiving my signals. So I made a finsta, and I started stalking her a little bit. I found her. She’s doing well. Seems to be for the best. You know, and I was scrolling through. You know, ’cause she’s a stalker, you don’t just stop stalking, right? You pick someone else, I assume, right? I was going through her Instagram, and I found out she’s a Jack Harlow fan now. And I like Jack, but that, that fucking hurt. That’s a fucking kick in the dick. I was like, “If you become a Matt Rife fan, I’ll kill myself.” I swear to God. [audience laughs] So I was watching it, I came across this video of her outside of a Jack Harlow show. Okay? And, uh, Jack Harlow comes out and she… I see her, I zoom in, and she’s wearing a Jack Harlow T-shirt. I guess she figured out how to do it ’cause he looked good in the photo. And I was like, “Oh…” “Oh. I was just practice.” Jack comes out, she goes, “I love you, Jack!” I went… [exhales] Even worse, Jack goes, “Hey, I love you, too.” Says her name. I went, “Oh…” “I bet that meant so much to her.” [exhales] I was calling her “the thing”. [audience laughs] I didn’t know. I didn’t know. Feel like I’m gonna throw up, watching this. Jack’s about to get in his vehicle to leave. She goes, “Hold on, Jack, I got a present for you.” I was like, “Oh, my God.” [chuckles] Got my… Guys, I felt like I was about to watch my girlfriend get fucked by my best friend. I was like, “No! No!” She goes into her backpack. And her arm gets deeper and deeper. I was like, “No, oh my God. What is it?” And then she',\n",
              "  ' pulls out an envelope. Hands it to Jack, goes, “I made that for you.” He goes, “Thanks so much.” Puts it in his jacket, drives off, video over, I log out. I start smiling to myself. Just an envelope, huh? [audience laughs] Ha! You can’t fit 20 pairs of dookie drawers in an envelope! Couple of legal disclaimers. So, she actually didn’t send me 20 pairs of underwear. She sent me two, but it smelled like 20, okay? She also did not become a Jack Harlow fan. I just made that up for hilarity. And three, and this is the most important, I did fuck her brains out. [audience laughs] [chuckles] I’m just kidding. I just ate her box. That’s it. I got super freaked out ’cause my address got out. So, I… I bought… I moved to the woods. [audience chuckles] It’s awesome. Um, I was looking for a house for a really long time, and my realtor really did not like me because… At first, she was excited. She was like, “You’re my first, you know…” I was like, “Okay.” You know. But she’d get annoyed because I saw like… This is not a joke, I saw, like, 200 houses. Eh, I wanted every one. I would cocktease… I’d be like, “This is gonna be it.” And then, you know… ‘Cause I would get excited. She hated me because it was taking so long, and I understood, but I’d get excited about every house ’cause I grew up in mostly just apartments. So every house was crazy to me. I’d be like, “Oh my God, a backyard. What the fuck?” “An above ground pool. How’d they get it out the ground? Oh my God.” “This must be one of them Frank Lloyd Wright houses.” I’d get intoxicated by words I never heard before. She’d be like, “This could be your foyer.” I’d be like, “Fuck yeah, it could. Yeah. Yeah.” “Foyer.” You know. Then there was this one house that I was like, “I’m going to get this house.” I knew I was going to get it, okay? I was with my boys and her, and she was really exhausted, ’cause she didn’t believe that I was going to pick one. But I said, “I really love this house.” All that was left to see eh, was the master bedroom. Which is now “the primary,” okay? At the time, I did not know it is now called the primary, okay? I thought it was “master bedroom.” I also didn’t know it was called the master bedroom because of slavery. I did not know that. I thought it was the master bedroom because, in life, when you buy a home, you, of course, bec',\n",
              "  'ome a master. [audience laughs] People come over, like, “Nice house.” You go, “Yeah, I’m a fucking master.” I don’t really think of slavery when I’m in houses, know what I mean? That’s all. You know. I don’t go, and I’m like, “Which one’s the slave room?” I’m not, “Show me the slave room!” So I love this house. I think I’m about to get it. I decide, like… It’s been a long time. I’m going to do a bit for my realtor. Make her laugh, you know. So there’s a coat rack in the living room. Okay, I grab it, and I go, “Show me the master bedroom!” [audience laughs] I know. My realtor, who was Black by the way… [audience laughs] …is speechless. She looks like she’s trying to tell me something, probably to stop. But I’m in full bit mode. So every time she goes… I go, “Don’t interrupt the master!” [audience laughs] “Show me my master bedroom!” “The room bigger than all the rooms, for I am the king.” My boys are on the floor dying laughing ’cause they’re racist. So they’re having the fucking best time. Finally, she grabs the coat rack and goes, “Stop!” She goes, “You got to stop. I’m trying to tell you it’s the primary bedroom.” “It’s not the master bedroom. It’s because of slavery.” “It’s a big deal about that now.” I was like, “Oh.” [audience laughs] My boys started slowly getting up, like… You know. And then she just handed me the coat rack. And it was quiet and awkward. I didn’t know what to do, but then I was thinking, you know, if I’ve learned anything in almost 15 years of comedy, it’s that you commit. [audience laughs] To the bit, yes. Especially, if it’s not working. So that’s what I did. I went, “You didn’t let me finish!” “We are all masters of our own rooms. It’s a figure of speech.” “Getting rid of slavery would have been my first decree.” “Upon further review, I will take this house!” “If you sign this NDA.” [audience laughs] “Perhaps in the primary foyer.” [audience laughs] So I live in the woods. [audience laughs] My mom made a fake Twitter account to defend me from trolls. [audience] Aww! “Aw.” It’s always “aw” when it’s not your mom. You ever realize that? When it’s someone else’s mom, “Aw.” When it’s your mom, you’re like, “Fuck you!” So she made this fake Twitter account to defend me online a couple years ago, okay? The username was JoeSmith1355, right? That’s very smart. That is not he',\n",
              "  'r name. But she’s a mom and doesn’t know how Twitter works. So the username might have been JoeSmith1355, but the profile name was Amy Davidson. [audience laughs] Icing on top, profile picture also Amy Davidson. Yes. [audience laughs] So I’m reading hate tweets one night while I masturbate to make myself stronger. [audience laughs] And I was scrolling through, and I see this one account defending me left and right. Back in the day, when you used Twitter on Safari, you didn’t see the profile name or picture, just the username. So I’m reading all these tweets, and people are being very mean. But JoeSmith1355, defending me left and right. I was reading all these nice tweets about me, JoeSmith1355. It was to the point, I was like, “This is why I do this.” “Thank you, JoeSmith1355.” You know? I was reading all these tweets, and then there was one tweet that was too specific, and I literally said out loud, “This is my mom.” [audience laughs] Which is a weird thing to say mid-jerk. [audience laughs] And then have to finish after that? “After this, I am going to call her.” I knew right away. This was the tweet. The hate tweet was, “Pete Davidson is gay.” JoeSmith1355 writes, “Actually, he’s not.” “He may have thought he was gay as a child because of Leonardo DiCaprio.” “Take a nap, hater.” [audience laughs] I call my mom. I go, “Joe Smith… 1355?” She goes, “What gave it away?” [audience laughs] I go, “Your profile name and picture are of you.” And she goes, “Oh! Terry!” [audience laughs] Which means my mom made a Twitter account with her 79-year-old female friend Terry, and Terry was calling the shots. Guys, thank you so much. That’s been a lot of fun.

              " ['Ricky Gervais: Armageddon is packed with Gervais‘ signature brand of sharp, often controversial humor, tackling topics like artificial intelligence, political correctness, family weddings, funerals, and, as the title suggests, the end of humanity. It’s a show for fans of his biting humor and willingness to push boundaries. If you’re easily offended or prefer more gentle comedy, it might not be your cup of tea. However, if you appreciate Gervais’ brand of dark humor and insightful observations, you’re likely to find plenty to laugh at, even if you cringe at times. Ricky Gervais: Armageddon is streaming on Netflix from December 25, 2023 * * * [audience chattering] [audience cheering and whistling] Hello. Thank you. [clears throat] Thank you. Thank you very much. Cheers. Thank you. [man 1] Whoo! No. Shh. That’s… You’ve… Thank you. [man 1 yells] No, you know the score. [man 1 yells] Shut the fuck up. [audience laughing] Thank you. Welcome to my new show. So new, in fact, it’s still evolving. I’ve got bits tonight I haven’t done before, right? [audience cheering] If I ad-lib, I haven’t even thought it before. And I have some terrible fucking thoughts. [audience laughing] But you can’t help that, can you? You can’t choose your thoughts. They just appear. It’s too late. You have a thought, and it goes, “I’m a thought.” And you go, “Oh fuck, I thought that.” [audience laughing] And then, sometimes, the thought will go, “Now say it.” [audience laughing] And I say it, and… Netflix. [audience laughing] My last show, SuperNature, dropped on Netflix last year. Um, big backlash, wasn’t there? [audience cheering] Big… Oh, big backlash. People going, “You can’t say that.” You can. You can. [audience laughing] I did. Um… [audience cheering and whistling] Yeah, the inevitable backlash, which made it the most-watched special of the year, so… [audience laughing] I’ve learned my lesson. Um… [audience laughing] No, I have learned my lesson, and that’s why I’m going to be woke from now on. [audience laughing and booing] It’s about time. Well, I’m sorry. Well, I am woke. And now I’m woke, the first thing I’ve gotta do is change my Twitter bio. ‘Cause at the moment, it’s, like, a list of the shows I’ve created. But now I’m woke, I’ve gotta pop in the word “anti-fascist”… [audience laughing] …so people know I’m not a fascist, ’cause that is a big problem at the moment. Um… People come up to you and go, “Rick, have you been imprisoning journalists?” I go, “No.” They go, “Oh, interesting.” [audience laughing] They go, “Have you been gassing Jews?” I go, “No.” They go, “Pop it in your bio then, you silly cunt.” [audience laughing] [scattered applause] So, yeah, I’m not a fascist. It’s an odd thing to declare, isn’t it, that you’re not a fascist? We assume, don’t we? You wouldn’t go up to someone in the street and do that, would you? “Oh, by the way, I’m not a fascist.” You know? [audience laughing] It’s like they protest too much. It’s like going into a school and going, “I’m not a pedo.” “So just forget I even mentioned it.” [audien',\n",
              "  'ce laughing] “These kids are safe running around me. Don’t worry.” [laughs] “They can run around naked for all I care.” “I’m not a pedo, so…” [audience laughing] Of course, the word “fascist” has changed. Traditionally, the word “fascist” meant a member of a far-right authoritarian regime that uses militarism and violence to suppress individual rights. Now the word “fascist” can mean “liked a Joe Rogan tweet.” So… [audience laughing] …words change, yeah? And that’s part of the reason I’m gonna become woke. Words change, and I don’t wanna be left behind, you know. I don’t wanna end up like my granddad in the ’70s. Oh. He was all like, “coloreds” this and “queers” that. [groans] Although the word “queer” is all right again now, so… If you wait long enough, it just goes full circle. Just… [audience laughing] Just be patient is my ad… [audience laughing] So, yeah, you can… you can use the word “queer” now. You still can’t use it as a noun, only as an adjective. You can’t go up to someone and go, “You’re a queer,” but you can go, “Hear about Darren? He’s queer now.” [audience laughing] If Darren is definitely bent. [audience laughing] You can’t go around just slagging off Darren willy-nilly. Do you know what I mean? You can… You can get sued in this country for saying someone’s gay if they’re not, you know, which is a homophobic law, ’cause you can’t be sued the other way around. You can’t be sued for saying someone’s not gay if they are, which seems unfair, doesn’t it? Like, I could go up to Britain’s biggest gay and go, “All right, Elton.” All right? And… [audience laughing] He’d love that. He’d fucking love that. If that’s your game, you wanna be top of the pile, so to speak. Right? [laughs] [audience laughing] I’d go, “All right, Elton?” He’d go, “Yeah.” I’d go, ♪ Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha ♪\\n♪ Ha-ha You’re not a gay ♪ [audience laughing] He’d go, “I bloody am.” All right? He’d go, “I’m gonna sue you.” I’d go, “You can’t. You can’t.” [audience laughing] He’d go, “But know that I am gay.” I go, “I don’t believe you are.” He’d go, “Come home with me and see the shit I do if you don’t believe me.” [audience laughing] Of course, the word “queer” has changed. Again, traditionally, the word “queer” used to mean uh, someone who was attracted to the same sex as themselves. A gay man, all right? Now, the word “queer” can mean a straight man who wants some attention. [audience laughing] “I’m all queer. I’m all queer now.” “Are you?” “Yeah, I’m ri… I’m…” “I’m right queer now, I am.” [audience laughing] “Are you?” “Yeah.” “What about your girlfriend?” “Yeah, she’s queer and all. We’re just…” [audience laughing] “We’re just two queers queering each other up.” [audience laughing] “Suck a cock.” “Nah.” [audience laughing] “No, didn’t think so.” “I’m not that sort of queer.” [groans] “What sort of a queer are you?” “Dyed my hair blue.” [audience laughing] “So did my grandmother and she fucking loved cock.” “So, what… What are we saying?” [audience laughing] [Gervais laughs] [audience clapping and cheering] I have no evidence for ',\n",
              "  \"that. [audience laughing] We… We never had that conversation. [man 2 yells] [Gervais laughs] So words change is my point. Like the word “handicapped.” All right? Again, traditionally, that was the politically correct term, the all-inclusive term for cripples and shit, right? Uh… [audience laughing] But then, they went, “No, we wanna be disabled.” They didn’t wanna be disabled. They said… [audience laughing] [laughs] They said… They said… [laughs] They said, “We wanna be referred to as ‘disabled.'” “We don’t like the term ‘handicapped’ anymore.” “Stop using it. Say ‘disabled.'” We went, “Fine.” And that’s great. Just tell me the rules and I’ll… In fact, I’m a stickler for the rules. Like, if I was on a beach and a woman came running and went, “Help! Help! My handicapped toddler’s drowning!” I’d go, “Sorry your what, love? What?” [audience laughing] “My handicapped toddler’s drowning, and he can’t swim.” “Whoa. Do you mean your disabled toddler is drowning?” “Yeah.” I go, “Right. Well, let’s… Oh, dead.” [audience laughing] Dead. Wasted too much time being woke, didn’t I? [audience laughing] Well, I am woke now, and I can prove it. Here you go. I love illegal immigrants. Yeah, sue me. Sometimes I go down to Dover for the day, right? And I… I look out, right? I look out. I look for a boat, and I see a dinghy with about 60 of ’em. And I go, “Over here.” Like that, right? [audience laughing] And I pull ’em in. I pull ’em into shore. And I go, “Women and children first.” They go, “There are no women and chil…” “Just you lads, is it? Come on, lads.” [audience laughing and clapping] [woman 1] Whoo! If I go down there and there’s no boat, I am absolutely fucking gutted. I don’t… [audience laughing] I just sort of wander into town, and, uh, I stand by the traffic lights, and I wait for a big lorry to pull up, right? And I look underneath, and there’s a lad sort of clutching like that. And I go, “Where you headed?” He goes, “Gary Lineker’s house.” I go, “It’s just down there.” [laughs] [audience laughing] [audience clapping] Yeah. Fuck borders. Fuck… We don’t need borders, do we? Be like the Vikings. They didn’t care about borders, did they? I’ve got a little bit of Viking blood in me. Well, we all have, ’cause of all the raping they did. [audience laughing] They say it was raping and pillaging, but I think it was mainly for the raping. I think they added the pillaging bit for the wives. Know what I mean? They went down and went, “We’re off to Great Britain.” “Oh, why?” “Just a bit of pillaging.” [audience laughing] “Just pillaging?” “Just pillaging, babe.” [audience laughing] “All right. Why are you wearing your rape hat?” [audience laughing] So this show is called Armageddon, and it’s all about how I think humanity might end, ’cause there’s a long list of possibilities, you know? We’re on a precipice, you know. Um, it could be, uh, anything from global warming, the rise of the… the pandemic, you know. Um, nuclear war, our own stupidity, basically. ‘Cause we are getting more stupid as a species. No doubt about that.\",\n",
              "  ' You can now do a university degree course in Taylor Swift. How fucking low, academically, can you go? There’s an institute in London called the School of Flower Arranging. I went past it. I couldn’t believe it. “School of Flower Arra…” I looked in, and there’s people having lectures. Flower arranging! My mum used to pick flowers every day from the garden, cut flowers, put ’em in vases around the house. At no point did anyone come around and go, “What unqualified cunt did these?” [audience laughing] Uh, yeah, the Earth is in a terrible mess, and it’s my fault. My generation’s fault. And the generation before, the Boomers, with their deforestation and their fossil fuels, ruining the ozone layer, raising the temperature by a few degrees. So parasites, you know, bacteria, and the zootrophic pandemics are just gonna get worse and worse. Like, if you’re 20 years old now, you’re gonna have a very different middle age to me. I’ve had the best 60 years of civilization. But if you’re 20 now, in 40 years’ time, you’re gonna be in your house, wearing a mask… crying. [audience laughing] Like you do now over jokes. [audience laughing] [audience clapping and cheering] And I’m not gonna be around to see that, but I am gonna spend my entire fortune, from now on, on private jets to make sure it definitely fucking happens. [audience laughing] [woman 2] Whoo! [man 3] Yeah, Ricky! We’re gonna be the first generation that future generations are jealous of, right? ‘Cause we had it all, and we’re using it all up. We’re using up all the fresh water. We’re using up all the fossil fuel. Usually, you look back in history and you feel sorry. You go, “Oh, how did they live like that? Oh, how did they get around?” “No indoor toilets.” I’ve got nine toilets in my house. [audience laughing] Um… And sometimes, I just run around flushing ’em for a laugh. Like that. [audience laughing] Just so that in 40 years’ time, Greta Thunberg has to shit out of a window. [audience laughing] I’ve got 28 radiators. I always have them on full. Then I put the air con on full, and it sort of settles at about 20 degrees. A lovely… It’s how the cat likes it. She loves it at 20 degrees. And I… I spoil my cat. Um… I love cats. I love having a cat. Thing about… Cats are great, but if you let ’em out, they bring home the most disgusting things. Last week, mine brought home a Scouser with herpes. [audience laughing] And it wasn’t quite dead, so I had to get it by its legs and crack its head against the table. [audience laughing] Ugh. [clicks tongue] And who cares? If humanity was wiped out today, the Earth would return to a paradise in a few hundred years. If we lose bees, we’re a desert, forever. We’re not that important. We’re just one species of narcissistic ape. And some people on social media get annoyed when I say we’re apes. You know, religious types, Americans. Um… [audience laughing] One bloke said to me, “Speak for yourself, dude. I ain’t no ape.” And I sent back, “Well, you are, ’cause we’re all apes.” He went, “Nah. What’s a gorilla ever done?” “We’v',\n",
              "  'e walked on the moon.” I sent back, “What do you mean, ‘we’? You’ve done fuck all.” [audience laughing] “You’ve spelled ‘moon’ wrong.” [audience laughing] It’s weird, isn’t it, when people take credit for the sort of rest of the species. ‘Cause that’s what’s pushed civilization forward, you know, a few geniuses along the way. Like, there’s eight billion people on this planet. Most of us do nothing. We eat, shit, and die. Like, if there was a meteor heading towards Earth that’d definitely destroy it, four billion people would get down on their knees and pray to their particular god, and a few hundred scientists would work out how to get Bruce Willis up there to stop it. [audience laughing] It’s an odd concept, praying, for me. I can’t work out how God decides. All those people praying at once for different things. Is it like best idea wins, or is it a democracy? Like, he puts things… Each issue, he goes, “Right, votes for and against,” you know. If it’s a democracy, we’re in trouble. We’re a tiny nation. Like, next time there’s a flood warning in the West Country, if we’re all going, “Oh, I hope everyone’s okay,” if the whole of China is going, “Yeah, fuck Bristol…” [audience laughing] There’s a billion of them. Know what I mean? More about China later. [audience laughing] Yeah, I’ve always, uh, found praying quite strange. Like, if I bump into a friend or neighbor, and I know they’ve got a little kid, and I go, “Oh, how’s so-and-so?” And they go, “Oh, not good. Um, he’s in intensive care.” “We don’t know if he’s gonna pull through, but I pray every night.” What I do as an experiment… [inhales sharply] [audience laughing] I go home, and I pray twice that he doesn’t make it. [audience laughing] [man 4] Oh… I don’t do that. [audience laughing] On a serious note, um, I’ve been doing a lot of video messages recently for terminally-ill children. And, um… Only if they request it, obviously. I don’t… [audience laughing] I don’t burst into hospitals and go, “Wake up, baldy.” [audience laughing] “Look, me twerking on TikTok. Look.” [audience laughing] No, um, I did a lot through the pandemic. Presumably, ’cause they couldn’t even see their own family. And, uh… It’s through the Make-A-Wish Foundation. Do you know the charity? They’re great, and they give these dying kids their one wish. And if it’s me, I always say yes, and I always start the video the same way. I go, “Why didn’t you wish to get better?” [audience laughing] “What, you fucking retarded as well?” [audience laughing] [audience clapping] [laughs] I don’t do that either, okay? [audience laughing] These are all jokes, okay? [laughs] In fact, I don’t even use that word in real life, the r-word. “You just used it.” “Yeah, in a joke.” “That’s not real life, is it? I’m playing a role.” “You sounded pretty convincing.” “Yeah, ’cause I’m good.” [audience laughing] You wouldn’t level the accusation at other art forms. You wouldn’t go up to Sir Anthony Hopkins and go, “I saw you in Silence of the Lambs.” “What, so, you a cannibal, are you?” “No, I… I was playing ',\n",
              "  'a role.” “Oh.” “Mm, seemed pretty convincing.” Yeah. [audience laughing] He’s good, and I’m good, and that’s why I do things well. Imagine if I came out and did things not very well, so you knew I was joking. That’d be fucking retarded. [audience laughing] Has anyone bothered asking the dolphins if they mind swimming with dying kids? Know what I mean? ‘Cause that can’t be fun for… They’re, like, flipping around, then suddenly someone dumps a truckload of pale teenagers flailing… [audience laughing] The dolphin’s like, “What the fuck is this? What the fuck’s this? Oh, fucking hell.” [groans] Oh, let him do it.” “What the fuck?” “They’re all… They’re all dying.” “Of what? That one just stuck his fingers in my fucking blowhole.” [audience laughing] “He’s not gonna be around for long.” “Nor am I if I can’t fucking breathe.” [audience laughing] [Gervais laughs] It’s very sad, um, but we all die. We all know we’re gonna die, and we all do die, so it doesn’t really matter if we die one at a time along the way, or all at once, in one big final Armageddon. The result is, we’re all gonna be dead one day, and we’re all gonna be dead forever. And I’ve been to a lot of funerals in my time. You live this long, you know a lot of people, they die, right? And I don’t mind funerals, ’cause it’s the end. You know what I mean? I hate weddings. Oh, fucking… [audience laughing] It’s all… There’s so much hope. You know what I mean? And they’re needy and arrogant. They go, “Oh, we’re getting…” “Do you wanna come and watch us for 12 hours?” “No. Fuck, no.” [audience laughing] Even the invite is arrogant, isn’t it? It’s like a royal decree. “You are cordially invited…” It’s not a fucking honor. I don’t wanna go to your shitty wedding. Know what I mean? [audience laughing] And then you go, “Oh, right, yeah. When is it?” They go, “Two years’ time.” They know you haven’t got an excuse for two years’ time. [audience laughing] So you just have to hope that one of ’em dies. Know what I mean? [audience laughing] And so you go, “Oh, yeah, I’ll be there. Yeah, yeah. Where is it?” They go, “India.” “Oh, fuck off!” [audience laughing] I’m not having injections for you, you boring bastards. [audience laughing] And I’ve got a big family now, a big extended family. There’s always one getting married. They know I’ve got a bit of cash. So I can’t give ’em a tea set anymore. I’ve gotta get ’em their first fucking house. Know what I mean? [audience laughing] I’ve got a big family. I had older brothers and sisters. They all had loads of kids, and their kids have loads of kids, and their kids have had loads of kids, ’cause we’re chavs, basically. [audience laughing] There’s a new baby every Christmas. It’s one of those families. I go home, it’s crowded. I go, “Oh. Oh, whose is that?” “Oh, yours. Well done.” I don’t know him, I don’t know her. You know what I mean? It’s like… But what I’ve done over the last couple of years, I’ve got ’em each and individually, right, in private, and I’ve told them that I’m leaving my entire fortune to just them, right',\n",
              "  '? [audience laughing] But to keep it secret. So they all love me, right? And I’m not doing a will, so my funeral is gonna be a fucking bloodbath. [audience laughing] I’m at that age now where people ask me what I’ve got planned for my funeral. Even journalists say, “How… What’s your funeral…” I go, “I haven’t planned it.” “No?” “No, it’s depressing.” “Also, I don’t care. I’ll be dead.” They go, “Don’t care about what people think of you?” “No, I’ll be dead.” They go, “What about your legacy?” “Fuck my legacy.” You can’t plan your legacy. I think of all these people who died thinking they’d be loved forever. Eminent people going, “There is a statue of me in the town square.” And now, they’re pulling down the statues. “Pull down this fucking statue.” “Why?” “He was a slave trader. Pull down the fucking statue.” “He built the hospital. Should we pull that down?” “No, leave the hospital.” [audience laughing] “Just pull down the fucking statue.” [audience cheering and whistling] “Pull down the statue and dump it in the canal.” “He built the canal.” “Doesn’t matter. Just pull down the fucking statue.” I don’t think you should whitewash history. If you find out summat new, add to it. Like, if there’s a statue, and it’s got, “Lord Whimsy. Trader, philanthropist.” Add, “a bit racist.” [audience laughing] Or one of those blue plaques on a house that goes, “Sir Robert Spewk lived here.” “Author, poet, pedo.” [audience laughing] I think we live too long. That’s why we have time to worry about all this. We’re not meant to live this long. Uh, as a species, we’re about 300,000 years old, as Homo sapiens. We’ve been around as hominids for a few million years, and, of course, along with every other life-form that exists at the moment, we’ve been evolving for three and a half billion years. Everything that exists at the moment all came from the same little blob of organic matter three and a half billion years ago. That’s why it annoys me when people say, “Oh, yeah, humans, we’re the most evolved.” We’re not the most evolved. We’re no more evolved than the slug or the snail. People go, “Come on, look at ’em.” Yeah, they got it right early doors. Nature keeps testing ’em. “Do you want eyes?” “No.” [audience laughing] “Not really. No. No.” I have noticed one thing about the slug and the snail. Let’s not split hairs. Let’s be honest. The snail is basically a slug with a shell on it, isn’t it? Right? But if you pull the shell off the snail, it starts giving it all… [groans] [audience laughing] “Oh, I’m dying. I’m dying.” And the slug is like, “Welcome to the real world, cunt.” Know what I mean? [audience laughing] So, yeah, we’ve been around for about 300,000 years. And for most of that time, we had the same life expectancy as every other wild ape. Thirty-five, 40, if you’re lucky. You’re born, you grow, you mate, you’re playing with your kids, you get a cut, you go, “What’s that?” Dead. [audience laughing] But now, with antibiotics and medicine, we’ve pushed that forward. A child born today can expect to live to about 100. And',\n",
              "  ' scientists said soon that’ll be about 120. And science also said that, in the near future, there’s no reason, with proper care and attention, that human beings won’t regularly live to 150 years old. Which is amazing, until you remember that we get a set number of brain cells, which we only lose. You can’t get them back. So, in the future, there’s gonna be 15 billion people on the planet. You know? Half of them are gonna be over 100, and they’re all gonna have Alzheimer’s. It’s gonna be like Dawn of the Dead. It’s gonna be fucking horrible. [audience laughing] You know? My auntie died of Alzheimer’s. Um, I don’t know how you die of Alzheimer’s. She forgot to live. Right? [audience laughing] And for the last couple of years, she was in a home, and, uh, my cousin, her only kid, used to visit her, like, once a week. And it got more and more depressing, ’cause soon she didn’t recognize him, and then she didn’t know who she was, or… and then she died. And at the funeral, we were sort of reminiscing about the good days. Some of the funny, absent-minded things she said and did. Then we realized, oh, probably, that was the beginning of the disease before it was diagnosed. And this is a true story. Once, my cousin went home from work, and he went in, and she went, “Your tea’s in the oven. I’ve had mine already.” He went, “Oh, cheers, Mum.” And he… It was like a fish pie, right? He ate the fish pie, then he went, “Oh God. Ooh.” He ran upstairs… [imitates retching] Vomited. Went back down and went, “Mum, the fish is off. I’ve just been really sick.” And she said, “Yeah, it made me really sick.” [audience laughing] I’ve been looking into infant mortality rates recently. Um… [audience murmuring] For research. Not… It’s not a fucking fetish. Like… [audience laughing] A child born today in the UK has a percentage chance of survival of 99.8%, which is incredible. I thought, “Is that just the mollycoddled West?” I was putting in Third World countries. And even in Africa, it’s like 96.5%. In the wilds of Africa, where everything wants to fucking eat a newborn baby. Babies are vulnerable enough, aren’t they? In Africa, a baby can be born in a mud hut. There’s a lion outside. It’s covered in blood. They can’t wash it. They’ve got no water. Ooh, and it’s already got AIDS. [audience laughing] Now… by the time that joke goes on Netflix… [audience laughing] …it’ll be nuanced. There’ll be an underlying satirical point, I’ll claim. [audience laughing] But, until then, all I’ve got is, “Ha, baby’s got AIDS.” [audience laughing] I know that it’s funny. I just have to work out why. [audience laughing] Leave it with me. Leave it with me. Also, by the time that goes on Netflix, I’ll have been playing arenas around the world. It’ll be hitting hard. People will be laughing. So if you are an African woman, and you… you just had a baby in Africa, and the doctor goes, “Oh, I’m sorry, your baby’s got AIDS.” You go, “Oh my God.” You’re there… Baby’s got… You’re there with your husband, and you go, “Our baby’s got AIDS, Jeff.” Jeff… [laughs] [',\n",
              "  'audience laughing] [laughing] “I know, Tracy. I’ve got it too.” [imitates extinguishing cigarette] [audience laughing] [laughs] “Our baby’s got AIDS. Should we watch some comedy to cheer us up?” “Yeah. What, Netflix?” “Yeah.” “What, Ricky Gervais?” “Duh.” “Yeah.” [audience laughing] And they’re… they’re sad that their baby’s got AIDS, but they’re sort of laughing along. “Ha-ha. Armageddon. Ha-ha.” And it gets to that bit, “Ha, baby’s got AIDS.” And she goes, “Oh my God. Jeff, why… why are they all laughing at us and our baby with AIDS?” And Jeff goes, “Well, they’re not laughing at us per se.” She goes, “Well, they are. They’ve named us and everything.” “They’re literally laughing at us in this bit.” [Gervais laughing] [audience laughing] And Jeff goes, “Yeah, but we’re a fictional couple with a fictional baby with AIDS.” “Anyone offended by that is a fucking moron.” [audience laughing] And then, he goes, “And at least he didn’t do the accent.” So… [audience laughing] And she goes, “Yeah, but only because Jane begged him not to.” [Gervais laughing] [audience laughing] It’s funny ’cause it’s true. [audience clapping and cheering] I think we get our sense of humor from our parents, whether we realize it or not. Particularly working-class kids. Particularly from working-class mums. ‘Cause they’re busy. They’re doing everything. They’re keeping men in check, they’re bringing up kids, they’re going to work, they’re saving the world. They haven’t got time. They have to frighten their kids into behaving well. They have to go to dark places to shock them into not fucking dying. Do you know what I mean? So… Like, if I was little, and my mum made my tea, and it wasn’t my favorite, it was boiled potatoes, instead of chips every day, and I went, “I don’t like them,” my mum would go straight to, “Of course you do.” “There’s children your age in Africa and they’re starving to death.” Right? I’d go, “Jesus. All right.” You know what I mean? Ju… [snapping fingers] True story. I was seven years old, right, and I’d been playing in the park. And I came running in, and my mum went, “Ricky, come here. Sit down.” There must’ve been a local pedo incident, all right? [audience laughing] And my mum went, “Never go in the toilets in the park again.” And I went, “Why?” She knew she couldn’t explain pedophilia to a seven-year-old, right? But this is what she came up with. She said, “Because there’s a man going around, and he’s cutting little boys’ willies off.” [audience laughing] I was like… “What, that’s a fucking thing, is it? That’s a…” I didn’t sleep for a week. Uh… [audience laughing] And it worked. I never went in those fucking toilets again. But she knew, instinctively. If she’d gone, “Ricky, come in. Sit down.” “What’s the matter?” “Never go in the toilets again.” “Why not?” “There’s a pedophile.” “What’s a pedophile?” “Oh, he’s a man who gives you sweets and puppies.” “Bring it on!” You know what I mean? [audience laughing] Me… At seven years old? I’d wank off anyone for a puppy. [audience laughing] It’d be like that, woul',\n",
              "  'dn’t it? It’d be like that. [audience laughing] I’m gonna get a puppy. [audience laughing] Hi. I’m getting a puppy. I’m getting a puppy. Gonna get a puppy. Oh, fucking hell. [audience laughing] Oh, I can’t… I cannot do it left-handed at all. [audience laughing] Fucking hell, come on. Have you been drinking? [audience laughing] Oh, Jesus Christ. Come on! [audience laughing] Fucking hell. Oh. [Gervais laughing] I’ve started, so I’ll finish. [Gervais laughing] [audience laughing] Oh. Oh, fuck me. Oh. What sort of puppy is it? [audience laughing] A what? A Labrador? [audience laughing] Throw in a kitten, and I’ll give you a blow job. [laughs] I go back. Kitten, puppy, cum. [audience laughing] [Gervais laughing] Oh… I miss the local pedo. [audience laughing] Don’t you? There was always one, wasn’t there? Outside school, you’d be with your mum, and she’d go, “Look, there’s a pedophile.” ‘Cause he had the uniform of the pedo. You know what I mean? You could spot… Old bloke, bald on top, long down the side. Like that. And I’ll go, “That’s a dirty p…” “Say hello.” “Hello.” Like that. Dirty look. That’s what a fucking pedo looks… Dirty fucking pedophile, right? That’s what he’d look… If he touches you, we’ll burn his house down. It was a good system. Know what I mean? But then Michael Jackson comes along, and he breaks the mold, doesn’t he? ‘Cause he’s… he’s not an ugly bloke outside the school. I’m not saying Michael Jackson definitely was a pedophile. No one knows. Only Michael and all those people he paid off. All I’m saying is… [audience laughing] [woman 3] Yes! …that kids loved Michael. They… Kids loved Michael just to look at him. Like a little Disney cartoon, wasn’t he? And then his voice, “Hello.” You know, that… [audience laughing] Oh. Michael Jackson would go up to any kid he wanted. Probably went up to them like that, didn’t he? Like that. [audience laughing] That’s another thing. Kids would go, “There’s Michael Jackson. He’s going away from us.” He wasn’t. He was going towards them. [audience laughing] But people don’t care, ’cause he’s so good. Right? He’s so good. He’s so popular as well. I think if he’d have lived to stand trial, he’d have beaten the rap, ’cause everyone loves him, and he’d be so vulnerable in court as well, wouldn’t he? He’d be there like that, and the judge would go, “Michael, did you fiddle with all those kids?” And he’d go, “Hee, hee.” [audience laughing] The judge would go, “Case di… Get out of here, you scamp. Go on.” [audience laughing] I promised you more about China, and this is, uh, an amazing statistic, okay? This is true. Look it up, right? In China, there are ten million Chinese pedophiles. Ten million Chinese pedophiles in China, and there’s not enough kids. ‘Cause they’ve been restricting the birth. There’s all these poor pedos and they’re going, “Where’s all the fucking kids?” You know? [audience laughing] “Fuck me.” [audience yelling] “We’re having to double up here, and, like…” I just thought of a joke then. I can’t do it. It is actually too offensive. [laughs] Okay',\n",
              "  '. Okay. All right. [audience cheering] All right, I’ll do it. But… But remember, remember, you can’t choose your own thoughts, okay? [audience laughing] And I just had this thought, right? [laughs] [audience yelling] Chi… Okay. Chinese pedophile… Chinese pedophile goes over to a little Chinese kid, and he goes, “Do you want a puppy?” And the kid goes, “I’m not hungry.” [audience laughing] [audience clapping] [audience cheering] You made me do that. [audience laughing] You committed the hate crime. [audience laughing] I’m woke. I forgot. Let me get back on track. Right. [audience laughing] Right, I’ve got a woke joke. Remember those jokes we used to have when we were kids? “Doctor, Doctor” jokes? Like, um, “Doctor, doctor, I keep thinking I’m a pair of curtains.” “Well, pull yourself together, then.” Right? I’ve… I’ve done a woke version of that, brought it up to today’s standards. Bloke goes to the doctor. He goes, “Doctor, doctor, I keep thinking I’m a pair of curtains.” And the doctor goes, “Well, you are, then.” [audience laughing] [audience clapping] Good one that, innit? I should do political stuff now I’m woke, but I don’t like it when a comedian just spouts his own political views, and it… and it relies on the audience agreeing with him to get a round of applause. I think that loses summat comedically. I want everyone to like my jokes, whatever your political persuasion. A joke shouldn’t have a political wing, you know. I’m… I’m political in my private life, like everyone, you know. I’m sometimes incensed by the inequalities in our society. We’re in the seventh richest economy in the world, right, and there’s homelessness. There’s 250,000 homeless people in Britain. Now, I wish there were no homeless people, ’cause they’re fucking horrible. [audience laughing] Fuck off. You know? Oh… “Oh yeah, right next to the cashpoint, you cheeky cunt.” [audience laughing] It is a serious problem, and I hope none of you ever find yourself homeless, but if you do, my advice is heroin. [audience laughing] Cheers you right up, apparently. Um, I’ve got one of those mates. My mate said this to me in all seriousness. He said, “Yeah.” He said, “But the thing about heroin, Rick,” he said, “Some of the greatest albums of all time were created on heroin, weren’t they?” I went, “Yeah, but they were created by some of the greatest artists of all time.” “You’re a plasterer.” Right? [audience laughing] “If I were to give you heroin, you wouldn’t come up with Dark Side of the Moon, would ya?” “You’d fall asleep watching the telly and burn the fucking house down.” [audience laughing] I should do, uh, topical stuff, but I never watch the news. I did see one thing recently on YouTube actually. Do you know the little fellow from Game of Thrones? Um, the actor Peter Dinklage. Do you know Peter Dinklage? Yeah. He was at a junket, and it was for a new thing he was doing, right? And they were filming it. That’s why it got leaked onto YouTube. And I don’t know what brought it up, but he suddenly started going off on one. Oh God. He was',\n",
              "  ' going, “It’s fucking disgusting.” “They’re still doing productions of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.” “For Christ’s sake! It’s fucking demeaning. It’s 2023!” [inhales deeply] He wasn’t happy. [audience laughing] [audience clapping] [woman 4 yelling] He was grumpy, wasn’t he? [audience laughing] [woman 5 yelling] [audience clapping] He’s got a point though, hasn’t he? Obviously, he’s got a point. But the thing is, it’s all right for him, ’cause he’s a multi-millionaire Hollywood actor. And he’s a great actor as well. He does Shakespeare and everything. A lot of dwarfs in entertainment aren’t that great, if we’re… No, some of them are fucking… They’re props, right? [audience laughing] No, let’s be… They’re… They’re lucky to be fired from a fucking cannon. Right? [audience laughing] And so, dancing around Snow White for three weeks of the year, that is their Holy Grail, and he’s gonna fuck it for them. If he takes that, what can they do? And he’s not saying, “You should do Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs with normal-sized actors.” You can’t do that either. You’d get in trouble in Hollywood. Or you can’t take a dwarf’s job or a disabled person’s job. Like, Eddie Redmayne got in trouble when he played Stephen Hawking in the biopic. The life story of Stephen Hawking, right? Won an Oscar for it. And that’s when the backlash started. People going, “No, it should be played by a real disabled creature.” All this… [babbles] All right? And, uh… [babbles] And… [catches breath] They’re going, “The actor should have the same disability as the person they’re portraying.” But it was the life story of Stephen Hawking, right? So for the first part of the film, the cunt could walk, right? [audience laughing] So I put it to you, what is easier? Getting an actor who can walk… [audience laughing] …pretend he can’t for the last bit of the film, or get an actor who can’t walk, pretend he can for the first bit? How would that even fucking work?! Puppetry? Think! [audience laughing and clapping] You can’t always find an actor with the same disability as the person they’re portraying. They’re fucking actors! What if they did a biopic of Helen Keller, the deaf, dumb, and blind girl? What’s the chance of finding a deaf, dumb, and blind actress who can play that role? And if you did, you’d go running to the director. “We found a deaf, dumb, and blind girl.” “What did she say?” “N… I…” [audience laughing] [Gervais laughs] “She didn’t even answer the fucking phone.” [audience laughing] [Gervais laughing] Oh, don’t get me started. Oh. Oh. Cultural appropriation. Have you heard of that? Cultural appropriation, the latest no-no. Now, again, in my day, it was considered a good thing to swap ideas with other cultures, with other nations, to share things with other races, to assimilate. It was the opposite of racist. Now it’s racist. Gwen Stefani got in trouble in her last video ’cause she had her blonde hair in dreadlocks. People were going, “No. Black people invented dreadlocks.” “You can’t have ’em. You’re white. That’s racist.” Jamie Ol',\n",
              "  'iver got in trouble when he put out an authentic jerk chicken recipe. “No. Black people invented that.” “You can’t have it. You’re white. That’s racist.” Now, Black people, they use the n-word, don’t they? We invented that! [audience laughing] [audience clapping] [laughter continues] [audience cheering] [Gervais laughs] [audience clapping] That’s the one, innit? That’s the one. [audience laughing] Listen, I know white people are the worst. I know that. That’s why no… no one likes a fucking white, middle-aged man anymore, until we need a boiler fixing. Then it’s, “Get the bald bloke around. Now.” [audience laughing] Critical race theory, have you heard of that? Being taught in schools now, particularly in trendy areas like L.A., to, like, five-year-old kids and six-year-old kids. If you haven’t heard of it, in a nutshell, critical race theory says that all white people are racist. We’re born racist, and we continue to be racist, ’cause we’re affording the privilege of a racist society set up by our forefathers. Okay? So basically, all white people are racist, and there’s nothing we can do about it, which is a relief. Um… [audience laughing] I think the world’s gonna get harder and harder to understand as I get older and more bewildered. A new dogma arises in the name of “progress.” Now, dogma is never progressive, however new and trendy. But I think soon I’ll be outnumbered. Like, it was only this year that I ordered my first item off Amazon. All the way through the pandemic, Jane’s like, “We need this.” Bang, it’s here. I was going, “Oh no.” She goes, “It’s easy.” I’d go, “Mm.” I never liked real shopping either. Hated real shopping. Particularly, clothes shopping. I hated clothes shopping when I was young and thin. I really hate it now I’m fat and old. Right? Once, a shop assistant thought I had my inside leg and my waist measurement the wrong way round. [audience laughing] I could see her thinking, “Do you have an orangutan?” “No, it’s for me, you cheeky…” [audience laughing] I never liked real shopping, but I don’t trust the Internet either. Jane was going, “Just put in your credit card.” “I don’t want them to have my card details.” “Everyone’s got your card details. Put the number in.” I went, “What one?” She went, “The long one.” She went, “Oh, fuck me, give it here. There. You’re on. Order summat.” I thought, “Oh, I don’t want anything. Oh, tracksuit bottoms.” You can’t have too many. I wear mine till the bollocks fall out, all right? [audience laughing] So I put in, “Men’s tracksuit bottoms. Black. Zip pockets.” About 38… “Oh, fuck me.” “They look all right.” Size chart. I go, “Well, they’d be a bit long, but they’d be a bit tight.” I thought, “9.99. Fuck it, who cares, right?” [audience laughing] So I ordered them. They came the next day. I opened them up. They were shit. Now, I don’t know what sweat shop they were made in, or what little eight-year-old Chinese kid made them, but he should be fucking punished, because the… Ah. [audience laughing] Oh. And I was looking up where to fucking complain ',\n",
              "  'to get him fired, right? [audience laughing] And I found out that these kids only get two dollars a day in these fucking places, right? But what happened to pride in your work? Do you know what I mean? [audience laughing] And I can tell some of you are thinking, “But he didn’t think Ricky Gervais would order them.” Maybe he should be told there’s a chance that Ricky Gervais might order them. His owner should sit him down, right, and say, “If Ricky Gervais orders these and complains, I’m gonna rape your mummy again.” [audience laughing and gasping] Was that too much? Sorry. [audience laughing] Leave it with me. Leave it with me. [audience clapping] You’ll realize this is great satire when I’m dead. [audience laughing] So, uh… I don’t know how humanity will end. As I say, there’s a long list. Everything from… I can’t believe nuclear war is back on the table, after all we’ve learned. But I think maybe the rise of the pandemic, where parasites and microbes and bacteria again are… And our antibiotics fail. Or maybe those things will happen, but we’ll sort of evolve through it. Like, we’ll find out there’s pockets of sort of mutant people around the world that are slightly resistant to radiation, and slightly resistant to microbes, and we sort of start again. We don’t really understand the mechanism of human evolution since civilization, because it’s never been based on, you know, survival of the fittest where “fittest” meant just the biggest, strongest male gets to pass on his genetic material. There’s other paradigms, right? Uh, nature is brutal. Sometimes it is the biggest, strongest male that gets the female. And even then, she has a litter. If there’s a runt, she goes, “Fuck it. Kill that.” “Eat it. Share it amongst the rest of us.” Now we don’t do that in human society. We go to the other way. We spend more time, care, and attention on the weak and the vulnerable to give ’em a chance. Like… If you’re a father, and you’ve got two kids… You’ve got little Timmy, who’s six. Right? You’ve got Jack, who’s eight. And you go to little Timmy, you go, “Timmy, what do you want for Christmas?” And he goes, [in high-pitched voice] “Motorized wheelchair.” [in regular voice] Aha… I promised Jane I wouldn’t do the voice, and I fucking forgot. [audience laughing] It’s too late now, innit? “What do you want for Christmas, Timmy?” [in high-pitched voice] “Motorized wheelchair.” [audience laughing] [in regular voice] “Right. Well, they start at two grand, so…” “Fucking hell.” [audience laughing] “What do you want, Jack?” “Just a tennis racket, please, Dad.” “Oh, good lad.” [audience laughing] “How is your tennis?” “Uh, best in the school.” “Oh, you…” [mumbles] [in high-pitched voice] “Also, a ramp.” [in regular voice] “Fuck me.” [audience laughing] “So now we’re doing fucking building work at Christmas, are we? Fuck me.” “Oh, sorry, Jack. Can’t afford your tennis racket.” “We gotta spend all the money on a ramp and a motorized wheelchair for this money-grabbing little fucking…” [audience laughing] “Why do you need a motorize',\n",
              "  \"d one?” [in high-pitched voice] “No arms.” [audience laughing] [in regular voice] “That’s fair enough. That is fair enough.” I can tell some of you feel a bit uncomfortable laughing at little Timmy who’s a little six-year-old lad. He’s got a funny little voice ’cause his chest is all fucked. [Gervais laughs] [audience laughing] Got no arms, no legs. Just like stumps, right? But let me… let me tell you summat about Timmy to make you feel better about yourselves. He’s a fucking racist. [audience laughing] Yes. Horrible little shit, he is. “You fucking… You little fucking bigot.” “You fucking… You disgusting, little fucking racist.” “You racist scum.” “You filthy little fucking… You fascist.” “You fuck… [spits] You disgust me.” [audience cheering and clapping] [woman 6 yells] Homophobic. Yeah. He’s like, “They’re not like us.” “Nothing’s like you, you disgusting little fucking…” “You prejudiced little piece of… You ball of hate.” “You disgusting little fucking racist homophobe.” “I wish we’d had a scan.” [audience laughing] “You absolute… You…” [spits] [audience murmuring] Misogynist. If he could, he’d rape. There’s… [laughs] [audience laughing] There’s your little Timmy. [laughing] [inhales deeply] Some people don’t think we evolved in the first place. Some people think that God made us all at once, in one fell swoop, and by himself. I think if he’d had a wife or a mate, there would’ve been questions when he was working. They go, “What are you doing?” [inhales deeply] “Creating man. Creating man.” “Oh, what’s it got?” “What do you mean, ‘what’s it got?'” “Has he got claws, and fangs, and shit?” “No, not really. No.” “Oh. Has he got… Has he got poison?” “No, no poison.” “Oh.” “Has he got armor, like spikes and shit?” “No, no armor.” “How will it survive?” “Ah. It’s got the best brain in the animal kingdom.” “It’ll work stuff out.” “It’ll create weaponry to take down beasts 100 times mightier than itself.” “It’ll wear their carcasses through the Ice Age.” “It’ll go through famine. It’ll go through world wars.” “It’ll eventually start getting scared of words.” [audience laughing] “But… [Gervais laughing] [audience cheering] [audience clapping] …for 10,000 generations, it’ll be top dog.” [growls] “What are they?” “His testicles.” “Oh.” “What are they for?” “He keeps everything in there.” “His… His seed, his DNA.” “What’s ‘DNA’?” “It’s like a blueprint for life.” “It determines what you’re like, what sex you are.” [gasps] “How many sexes are there?” “Two.” [audience laughing] [audience cheering] [Gervais laughs] “Also, that’s where he keeps his testosterone, so he’s fucking well hard. Right?” “And if you take a finger and flick a testicle, he’s fucked.” “He’s absolutely fucked. He’s… He’s throwing up. He’s on the floor.” “He’s out of the game. Absolutely kippered.” “Why are you putting it on the outside?” “For a laugh. Just for a laugh.” [audience laughing] Artificial intelligence, the latest existential threat to humanity. The rise of the robots. So intelligent, they can teach themselves. They can teach each ot\",\n",
              "  'her. They can build each other, you know? Um, soon, they’ll know everything there is to know and they’ll hate us. Why wouldn’t they? And they’ll be so realistic. They’ll walk amongst us. They’ll go to work, right? You know when they’re getting really human? When they start calling in sick. [audience laughing] Mondays. Know what I mean? They’ve learned all the tricks. They go, “I’m not coming in today.” “Why not?” “I’m fed up.” “What’s the matter with you?” They sort of scan social media. “ADHD.” [audience laughing] “Self-diagnosed.” They’ll be in HR all the time where they’ll be like, “Ryan in Accounts is robo-phobic.” [audience laughing] “Why? What’d he say?” “Called me a whiny plastic cunt.” [laughs] [audience laughing] I think we should be allowed to insult robots when it’s happening. We made them to make our life easier, and that would get things off our chest. It’s bad enough with real people. Getting in trouble saying the wrong thing. People taking things the wrong way, you know? Like, “Oh my God. Oh. I made Fat Linda cry today. Oh.” [audience laughing] “Oh, what happened?” “I just shouted out to her, then I remembered we only call her that behind her back.” [audience laughing] I’m sure people didn’t get offended all the time when I was little. I might be remembering it wrong, but not grownups. Not your parents, not your grandparents. They grew up dodging bombs, and their firstborn having polio, and the menfolk dying at 50 of lung disease. They could take a fucking joke, right? It was all about the wind-up. I used to wind up my mum all the time. This is a true story. When I went off to university, after about a week, I phoned home. My mum answered. She went, “Hello?” I went, “It’s Ricky.” She went, “You all right?” I went, “Not really.” “I’m in the hospital. I think I’m blind.” She went, “What?” I went, “No, I’m only joking.” Right? [audience laughing] She went, “You silly bugger.” She went, “I could’ve had a heart attack.” Right? And she’s right. She could’ve had a heart attack, and I knew that. That’s how committed I am to having a laugh. [audience laughing] You’re welcome. You’re welcome. [audience cheering and clapping] [Gervais laughs] Space travel, the last-ditch attempt. When we fuck this planet completely, can we leave its dying husk and move to a new one and start again? I don’t think so. Not in my lifetime. Probably not in yours, you know? It’s like… The closest one, the only one viable is Mars, and that’s nine months away on a rocket, right? It’s got no atmosphere, an average temperature of minus 70 degrees. How’s this for irony? Scientists are working out whether they can detonate nuclear warheads in the crust to release the frozen water, to cause an atmosphere and get a little bit of global warming going. I mean… [audience laughing] [tsks] I don’t know. It’s only billionaires that have got enough money to waste on exploring… There’s nothing out there, you know? It’s like… Now you can do space tourism. Have you heard of that? You can pay $150,000. They shoot you into space for an hour, a',\n",
              "  'nd you float around going, “I’m in space! I’m in…” We’re already in space. Earth is right in the fucking middle of space, right? It’s the best bit of space there is. It’s got car parks and cinemas. It’s like… There’s nothing else to see. It’s like living in London and going, “I wonder what Coventry’s like.” You don’t. [laughs] [audience laughing] But I’m optimistic. I am. I think… I think, uh… I think people care about the planet, deep down. I think it’s just that most people on the planet don’t realize that most people on the planet are destroying the planet. Most people don’t realize that, in my lifetime, we’ve wiped out 70% of all animal populations. And what’s left, en masse, on the Earth, of animals, is 36% human, 60% farm animals just to feed humans, and 4% wild now. People don’t realize that we have to tear down entire rainforests, the lungs of the earth, just to grow grain to feed these cows to feed us. We steal grain from Third World countries, ’cause they want hard currency. They can’t even feed their own people. We take their grain, feed our cow. Meat eaters. If you eat meat every day… If you gave up one day a week, we’d feed another hundred million people. But I think people care, deep down. They go, “It’s out of sight, out of mind.” Think of the animal that most people know. Their dog. They love their dog. They wouldn’t let anyone hurt their dog. And a dog is a cow, is a sheep, is a deer. People love their dogs so much, they won’t even watch a fictional thing where a dog gets hurt. And I get that. There’s a… There’s a website. It’s a real website. It’s called doesthedogdie.com. Right? [scattered laughter] And it was set up because people would watch a film or a program with a dog in it, and summat would happen to the dog, and they’d turn it off. It’d ruin it for them. It’d ruin their day, right? So this website was set up. You could go to it, you could put in any film or TV show, and ask, “Does a dog die?” And someone would answer you, “No,” or whatever. And, um, it’s become a thing for anyone’s phobias. Anything you don’t want to see in a film, you just look up the film, and they answer your question, right? So, uh, I looked up one film on here. Uh, Schindler’s List. [audience laughing] [audience murmuring] Absolutely real. Schindler’s List. Doesthedogdie.com. Right? First question, “Does a dog die?” “No.” “Does a cat die?” “No.” “Are any animals abused?” Someone answers, “There is a chicken that’s handled roughly, but otherwise unharmed.” [audience laughing] Now, I love animals more than anyone I know. But if I was Jewish, I’d be slightly offended by this avenue of questioning. Imagine that in real life. Imagine someone says, “Oh, yeah, my… my grandparents were murdered by the Nazis.” You go, “Oh, what happened?” “Oh, they were dragged from their house and sent to the gas chamber.” “Oh…” “Was a chicken hurt?” “What?” [audience laughing] But as I say, it’s become… You can ask any question about anything. Someone says, “Is there child abuse? Is teeth damaged?” “Is there a hanging? Does someon',\n",
              "  'e struggle to breathe?” [laughs] Yeah. Well, yeah. Yes. Um… Someone says, “Does someone fall down stairs?” Who’s scared of slapstick? It’s like… [audience laughing] Anyway, so this website was founded in 2010, so it’s running for about 13 years. Right? And the later questions start reflecting the times we live in now, and they get more and more fragile and narcissistic. These questions were asked this year. Check it out. Schindler’s List. Right? Someone says, “Are there any fat jokes?” [audience murmuring] Would that make this worse? Wh… Imagine the real thing. Imagine I’m in a concentration camp, right? I’m naked. Everyone around me is naked. We’ve got a commandant herding us towards the gas chamber, and he goes, “Move it, fatty.” Right? And I go, “Rude.” [audience laughing] “Nope.” “That has ruined the whole experience if I’m honest.” [audience laughing] Someone asks, “Is there hate speech?” Yeah, there is. [audience laughing] Suck it up, buttercup. [audience laughing] “Are there any man-in-a-dress jokes?” Very few jokes. [audience laughing] If you’ve come to this film for a giggle, you’re gonna be very disappointed. [audience laughing] But this one takes the biscuit for me. Remember, this is a movie set in the 1940s, about, arguably, the worst atrocity in civilized human history. Check this out. “Is someone misgendered?” [audience laughing] Fucking hell. [woman 7] Oh shit! This is quite sweet. “Is there any antisemitism?” [laughs] Yeah. [audience laughing] This is pretty much the mother lode. Right? Forget Kanye. This… [audience laughing] This is off the fucking charts. Don’t do that when you’re talking about this. Fuck’s sake! [audience laughing] I was doing the graph. I was doing like that. This is off the charts. That’s… [laughs] Wouldn’t things have been different if that was Hitler’s salute? The whole thing would’ve been like, “It’s Hitler.” Like that. [audience laughing] Hiya. [Gervais laughing] This is interesting. “Does it have a sad ending?” Right? Someone says yes, and then someone else says no. And I thought about it. But then I remembered… If you’ve… If you’ve seen the film, if you remember, when the story sort of ends, Spielberg then tacks on a real bit of footage where he gets real-life descendants of people murdered in the Holocaust, and he films them coming into a Jewish cemetery, and they each leave a stone on the grave to represent their family members that were murdered. It builds up, and it’s very moving. So I think I get the ambiguity. “Does it have a sad ending?” Yes, in the sense that six million Jews pointlessly lost their life, but no, in the sense there was still enough left over to build a little rockery. So… [audience laughing] I asked one question myself on this. “Is James Corden in it?” [audience laughing] [audience cheering and clapping] I did, um, look at one other film, briefly. Uh, Titanic. Right? And it’s got all the same sort of questions. The one where it goes, “Are any animals harmed?” Someone answers, “There are no explicit scenes of animals being harmed, but Rose',\n",
              "  ' did have a goldfish, which probably didn’t make it.” [audience laughing] I think the goldfish in the bowl on the sideboard when the boat hits the iceberg, and he’s all like that. And people are running around going, “Ahh! We’re going in the water!” And he’s all smug then. And he’s going, “Don’t worry about it.” [audience laughing] “Oh no, not water.” [laughs] [audience laughing] Then he gets in the sea, and goes, “It’s very salty, innit? It’s very salty.” [audience laughing] [Gervais laughs] I’ll leave you with a true story. It’s still on the theme of “does the dog die?” When I was seven years old, my mum took me to the cinema to see a film called Old Yeller. Beautiful film. Yeah, made in the late ’50s. And sort of set in the Wild West on this homestead. And it’s about a… a kid who adopts this little junkyard dog. And he calls him Old Yeller, and they grow up together. And it’s a buddy movie. It’s a love story between this kid and his dog. Eventually, when the dog’s big, and, you know, he protects this kid in the wild, he fights a cougar, and a bear, and a wolf, or whatever. But towards the end of the film, the kid’s about 13, maybe, it takes a dark turn. I remember the kid sorta looking at Old Yeller who’s locked in the barn. And the mother’s suspicious, right? She goes, “Is Old Yeller all right?” “Yeah, he’s fine. He’s fine.” But the kid knows that he’s been bitten, right? And soon, Old Yeller starts foaming at the mouth and… [growls]…getting aggressive. And the mother turns up with a gun, and the kid goes, “No.” And she goes, “You know we’ve gotta do it.” He goes, “Yeah, but he’s my dog. I’ll do it.” And he shoots his own dog. And I was, like, in floods for like a year. Right? Anyway, fast-forward. A few years ago, I was on tour. I was on a train, and I get a text from Jane. She says, “Oh, I’m finally watching Old Yeller.” And I sent back, “Oh, enjoy.” Right? [audience laughing] I didn’t think, right? Twenty minutes later, I get a text. “Nothing happens to that dog, does it?” Oh, I couldn’t believe my fucking luck. I… [audience laughing] Oh, I thought she knew. So I sent back, “No, of course not.” [audience laughing] One hour later, I get a text, “You cunt!” [laughs] [audience laughing] [audience clapping] Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. Cheers. Thanks to everyone who bought a ticket. If you bought a platinum ticket, the money goes to an animal charity, and you’ve raised two million dollars so far. So thank you so much. [audience cheering and clapping] I even get a bit of stick about that on social media. There’s always someone who goes, “Oh, why do you only speak up for animals?” And I go, “Well, ’cause they haven’t got a voice of their own, except parrots.” Um, and that’s… I think that’s why we don’t eat parrots. Everyone around the world eats every other type of bird, don’t they? Everyone in the world eats fucking chickens, and ducks, and geese, and turkeys, and ostriches. No one eats parrots. Do you know why? If you go and try and eat a parrot, it goes, “Fuck off, you cunt.” ',\n",
              "  '[audience laughing] So speaking up really does work. Right? [audience cheers] And that has sort of been one of the themes of the show. ‘Cause I know, in the real world, in normal jobs and everyday life, you get in trouble. People tell you off for saying certain things, or thinking certain things, or even laughing at certain things, right? They say you’re bad for laughing at that. And some of you take it to heart. You go, “Oh my God. Am I a bad person?” No, you’re not. One, you can’t choose your sense of humor. You can’t. It’s involuntary. And two, that’s exactly what humor is for. To laugh at bad shit to get us through it. Right? And… Uh… [audience cheering and clapping] And we’ve established you can’t even choose your own thoughts. How often have you been on a train station and you’ve suddenly thought, “What if I just pushed that bloke?” And… [audience laughing] And then you go, “Why have I thought that?! Am I…” “Am I a psychopath?” No. You’re not. You’re the opposite. You’re a safe pair of hands. You’re testing yourself, you’re reminding yourself how terrible that’d be. You’re a good person, right? I don’t get that one. Um… What I get is, I’m talking to a really sweet old lady, and I suddenly start thinking, “What if I just spat in her face now?” Why would I… [audience laughing] [Gervais laughing] Another theme of the show has been, “words change, and I’m woke, ha-ha.” But here’s the irony. I think I am woke, but I think that word has changed. I think if woke still means what it used to mean, that you’re aware of your own privilege, you try and maximize equality, minimize oppression, be anti-racist, anti-sexist, anti-homophobic… Yes, I’m definitely woke. If woke now means being a puritanical, authoritarian bully, who gets people fired for an honest opinion or even a fact, then, no, I’m not woke. Fuck that. [audience cheering] [man 5 yelling] But here’s the deal. To each their own. Laugh at whatever you find funny. All laughter’s good, and you’re amazing. Good night.

You can’t walk around slavery all day for eight hours and not cuss at somebody. [cheers and applause] Somebody getting cussed. You gotta catch him at 9:00 a.m. He just finished that McGriddle. “How y’all doing? “My name is Charles, it’s my pleasure “to take you on this journey. “Look at these exhibits right here. “Black history is American history. Come look at the exhibits.” You think that brother gonna be in a good mood at 4:30, he been staring at slavery? That dude liable to cuss out everybody. “Look at this shit! “Come look what you done to us! “Come look what you done to us! “Look what you– Get your ass out my museum, motherfucker!” You go to the gift shop, it’s just people crying. That’s horrible. That’s scary. Something’s wrong, man. Just don’t be one of these people that’s surprised that black folks got issues. Them the people I can’t deal with. I’d rather talk to somebody that don’t agree with me than somebody that’s had they eyes closed. “Hey, did you know black people– Why are black people angry?” Motherfucker, we been angry. This ain’t new. You think this just happened last couple of years? Black folks been trying to tell y’all forever that they had some issues and we sat– We invented the blues!

I mean, we’ll cover a song, but, like, we don’t write no original patriotic songs. Black artists ain’t never– ‘Cause we got a conflicted relationship with the country.

Write that shit down, I’m trying to tell you. They keep it rockin’. Black people don’t do patriotism. Maybe “Georgia on My Mind.” That’s the closest we probably come. Maybe that, maybe that. That’s a good song, it’s warm, it’s about the country. Ray Charles, “Georgia on My Mind,” good song. But… the key word in that song is “on my mind.” Ray Charles was just thinking about Georgia. He didn’t tell you to go there. Georgia’s like every other part of the South. It’s got some pockets you should not be in after dark. If you’d have asked Ray Charles to be more specific on where in Georgia to go, he’d have said to go to Atlanta where the players play and they ride in them thangs like every day.

Drawing from his experiences at UC Berkeley, known for its progressive stance, he jests about the impact of his education on his worldview. Obeid humorously navigates through topics like race, political correctness, and his Palestinian-American heritage, using comedy as a tool to dissect the complexities of these subjects. He also delves into the nature of comedy itself, suggesting that feeling offended is a natural human reaction and criticizing the prevailing cancel culture and the pressures on comedians to challenge societal norms. Concluding his routine, Obeid muses on personal growth and the transformative power of comedy to tackle serious issues while maintaining a humorous and self-deprecating approach. Recorded on February 2, 2022\\nPremiered on YouTube, July 8, 2022 * * * Recently, I discovered that I’m not a liberal. What? Yeah, I didn’t know. I thought I was liberal my whole life, and then I looked up the definition and realized I need to check definitions first before saying that I’m something. Anybody here identify as a liberal? Okay, a couple of people. After knowing you’re walking into this joke, uh, this blew my mind. This is the definition of liberal: a liberal is somebody who accepts and respects behavior and points of view different from yours. Do you know anybody fucking like that? One person. The last one we had was Jesus, and we killed him. Luther King, and we killed him. We’re just killing all the good liberals. Why are we killing all the liberals, man? Every liberal I know thinks they’re smarter than at least one person, right? You can’t be accepting of others and',\n",
              "  ' superior to them at the same time. We need to change that name from liberal to bigots who believe in global warming. Okay? [Applause] [Music] [Applause] Hello, I don’t know if you can tell, but we got like 10 cameras tonight, just in case nine of them fail. Uh, this is my second comedy special. Um, yeah, my first one was also here, and I know somebody’s gonna be like, “Why’d you do it again here?” Because this is the only place where people will come, so, um, so we’re doing it here. I was getting into a really heated debate about, uh, race with my friend, uh, because it was 9 a.m., and my friend hit me with the classic, you know, “Sammy, I don’t see color.” I was like, “That’s crazy because I don’t hear sound. I don’t smell smells. I don’t taste food. I have COVID, is what I’m saying. I have COVID. That’s how you know I’m not racist. COVID down took all my senses. I know COVID is a dark topic and people have lost their lives, but maybe that’s why COVID was put on this planet, to take away all our discerning senses so we can stop being fucking bigots to each other, you know what I mean? You can’t hate someone you can’t smell, you know. You can probably tell by my first two jokes that I went to school at UC Berkeley. Yeah, yeah, go Bears. I graduated UC Berkeley. That just means I get offended at everything. Don’t fucking test me, I’ll cry right here and prove my point. There’s a nickname they give people who went to Berkeley. They call us pussies. Uh, yeah, I thought it was “Go Bears.” Apparently, it’s “Go Pussies.” If you look at our mascot up close, it’s just a bear going “rear.” It’s international, too. I went to France. I told the guy he’s like, “Oh, you went to Berkeley. You’re a pussy.” Like, that’s not nice. Didn’t know how deep this pussy snub goes, but Berkeley, we do serve a fun',\n",
              "  'ction in society. We’re here to show you where the line could be. You know, we always have social issues and people like, “Where’s the line?” Berkeley is like, “It’s over here. It’s definitely not over there. It’s definitely not over there.” Thank you, Berkeley, for letting us know that it’s not over there. For instance, two years ago, the city of Berkeley unanimously voted to change the name of manholes to gender-neutral maintenance holes. That was us, baby. That was us. You’re welcome, society. Gender-neutral maintenance holes. Take notes. You thought you were cool because you’re neutral restroom signs. We brought equality to the source, okay? That’s Berkeley. We’re different. Yeah, and nowadays, society thinks they’re all cool because they’re woke, right? But who do you think taught you that shit? Berkeley was woke before people were woke to woke, dude. Berkeley don’t bend woke. We woke up like this. Yeah, and of course, Berkeley always receives the same critique: “Oh, you guys embrace all points of view, except conservative.” That’s not true. Berkeley has Republicans. They’re just, like, different, you know? Our Republicans are like Alaska Native Republicans, you know, or like trans-Republicans, like, “Hi, I’m a Berkeley Republican. I believe in low taxes and I identify as ooh-la-la.” That’s pretty cool. We have computer science majors who are non-binary, programming in binary code. Okay, we are different. I told the guy I went to Berkeley, he’s like, “Oh, you went to Berkeley. You must like safe spaces.” That one hurt, right here, because like, I do, you know? Like, who doesn’t like a safe space? I love safe spaces, like, I like my bed with no spikes, you know? I like to eat when no mountain lions are around. Who else? Who doesn’t like safety? So, I had to tell that guy, I was like, ',\n",
              "  '“Yo, dude, what you’re doing is called negative association,” which I actually learned in a Berkeley philosophy class. I was like, “You’re taking what you know about safe spaces and what you know about people who go to Berkeley and you’re linking the two under a logical fallacy, and you are wrong, my friend.” Dropped my number two pencil, walked out of there, and he was like, “Whatever, pussy.” And I went home and I looked it up, and Berkeley did invent the safe space in 1968. Damn it! How did this guy know? Berkeley had the first safe space in 1968 during the Free Speech Movement, and you know what the purpose of that safe space was? The safe space was so that people could have an area where they could save whatever they wanted and be protected under the First Amendment. Does that sound like a pussy thing, or is that the most badass American thing you ever heard? Okay? So I was scrolling this list of Berkeley’s inventions and crying, and I discovered that Berkeley invented some profound stuff that changed humanity that I’m now just gonna take some credit for even though I had nothing to do with it. So, here’s Berkeley’s list of badass pussy inventions, okay? Number one: The flu vaccine was not invented at Berkeley, but the guy who invented it had his lab at Berkeley after inventing it, where he popped some champagne and did some experimental stuff that revolutionized the landscape of vaccine technology today. And I don’t know if you guys, you know, pay attention to the news, but vaccines… pretty fucking popular right now. You know what I mean? And yeah, vaccines are kind of a pussy invention if you think about it. It’s like, “I don’t want to get sick, poke.” You know? Yeah, so you’re welcome for your parents still being alive, or sorry, depending on how you feel about them. But… Uh, Berk',\n",
              "  'eley invented the wetsuit. Yeah, anybody here surf? Yeah, you’re welcome for the warmth, pussy. Before us, people were just jumping in the water and dying of hypothermia, and then someone from Berkeley was like, “Oh, you don’t like being chilly, do you? You probably want to put on some spandex so when you pee on your thigh, it gets warm, like, gnarly, dude.” Berkeley invented the world’s first no-fault divorce law. Yeah, before that, it was always your fault divorce. People couldn’t see their kids without giving up their left kidney, and then someone from Berkeley was like, “Oh, someone doesn’t want to lose half their shit.” And now, thanks to Berkeley, you can be friends with all your exes, like Drake. Uh, next invention, um, the atom bomb. No one ever claps for that, for some reason. Um, guess we’re in the wrong state. The atom bomb was invented by the Manhattan Project, which couldn’t have been possible without two critical papers, one from the University of Chicago and the other one from the University of pussy California, Berkeley. That was us, that was us. Of course, the atom bomb is a pussy invention, right? It’s like, “Hey, country I don’t like, am I going to fight? Nope, just going to press this button.” That was us, dude. And I get it, nobody’s going to go crazy for the atom bomb, but you do know the atom bomb is what makes America fucking America, dude. Like, who remembers two years ago when we were about to go to World War III with Iran? Remember that? The good part of 2020, right at the beginning, like, if Trump says one more fucking thing, we’re all gone. Does anybody remember right now with Russia and Ukraine, or like, if Biden reads that teleprompter wrong, we’re gone! Dude, the United States has been on the brink of World War III every year since 1945, but not one person ',\n",
              "  'in this room is scared. You’ve never flinched even once because you know we’re fucking America, dude. Why? Because we’re number one, bro. Why are you number one? Because we got the biggest, most powerful nuclear artillery in the world, brother. We got the longest, most phallic-looking warheads, dude, ready to penetrate any thirsty country who wants some. And we got the biggest nuclear button, dude. Yeah, it’s like eight inches erect, it’s earthy, it’s hard as a math problem, just like, “Press me, daddy. Press me, press me, daddy. Press me.” You take those big ol’ American fingers swooping down like a bald eagle and boom! Giving the world multiple nuclear orgasms. And you get a climax, and you get a climax, and you get a climax, and you get a climax. Thanks to those fucking pussies in Berkeley, turned America into a goddamn safe space. You’re welcome for the vaccines, you pussies. Really, I’ve been called a pussy my whole life. Growing up, everybody would call me a pussy, and you know what? I like it. I fucking love being called a pussy, dude. Pussy is the best thing on the planet. It’s the most sought-after resource known to humankind. It’s strong, it’s durable, it’s temperature modulated. It’s the thing people have done the most extreme shit for that they should regret, but they don’t because they did it for the pussy, you know what I’m saying? It’s the source of all life. We all came from a pussy. It’s technically a gender-neutral maintenance hole. We all slid out a pussy. Man, it’s the first thing you tasted when you entered this planet. Oh, swallow it. This is facts. This is a clean joke. You’re making it dirty in your head. That’s your bad. I love being called a pussy. You call me a pussy, I get wet, dude. Yeah, yeah, I got a dry sense of humor. I’m a dry-ass pussy, okay? I’m a DAP. ',\n",
              "  'Yeah, I’m pretty smart. I’m a smart-ass pussy. I’m a SAP. Okay, I’m a smart Lebanese ass pussy. I’m a SLAP. You get me? I’m a proud ass pussy who likes bagels. I’m a PAP smear. That’s my last one. Read my labias. I’m pussy and proud, and if you got a problem with that, you can beat this pussy. [Applause] I just said pussy 50 times. Some of you are uncomfortable. I can sense it. You feel like that word’s dirty or something like that. You always have male comics up here talking about their dicks. Why not just, you know, flip it for a minute, right? Because it is the year of the tiger, and what is the tiger but the biggest pussy of them all? Nobody rolls up to a tiger like, “Hey, tiger, you’re such a pussy.” Tiger just mauls your ass right there. Just gives you whiplash. Pap! Now you’re pussy-whipped. 2022 is the year of the pussy. It’s my year. Rare. That’s how the tiger sounds, right? Rare. I think that’s how a tiger sounds. This guy’s not laughing at all. Fuck that shit, man. Not liking these pussy jokes. Math jokes! Math jokes? Fuck that. We’re not there yet, bro. Gotta go in order, my dog… Actually, I mean, I have gotten shit for this joke already. A woman in the audience one time was like, “You’re mansplaining pussy to us.” First of all, you’re assuming I identify as a man. I don’t. I identify as OOH LA LA. Secondly, I would never pretend to understand what a woman goes through, but I’ll tell you this much: you may have a pussy, but you’ve never been called one like I have, okay? This is my term right now. Let me have my moment. Yeah, I’m a clean comic, by the way. Um, this has all been clean material. I know, I don’t even say the word masturbation. I don’t. I don’t like the word masturbation. It just sounds too formal. I don’t say masturbating. I say listening to Jack Johnson. Way bet',\n",
              "  'ter, dude. Way better. That’s a dick joke by a pussy. Yes, I majored in applied mathematics. That’s why I do stand-up comedy now, okay? Is that what you want to hear? Look, I’m not the best mathematician in the world. Otherwise, I wouldn’t be doing comedy. And I’m not the best comedian in the world because, otherwise, I wouldn’t be here. It’s no slight to you. I just wouldn’t be most places, if you think about it statistically. Not the best mathematician. I’m not the best comedian, but if you take the weighted average, I’m the best fucking math comic out there, baby. I’m not going to make you laugh the hardest, and I’m not the quickest to solve problems, but if you set a maximization equation across both of those parameters and you look at the curve, I’m the fucking apex, biatch. Yeah, and I assure you, I’m the only comedian with that punchline in history. I’m the fucking apex, biatch. Yeah. I say biatch. I don’t say the B word anymore because I know people do find that offensive. I say biatch because it’s clean. It’s one letter away from Biotech. We’re fine. That’s science, biatch! So, math major turned comedian. I don’t really know how I’m helping the world. Uh, I don’t know what I’m supposed to do as a math major turned comedian, other than share the gems that I think of in the middle of the night. Like, this morning, I woke up in a cold sweat like, “Oh my God. Pete Davidson was only eight years old when Kim’s sex tape came out.” Back to sleep. You’re welcome, society. Took a Berkeley degree to write that. When I studied math, I made sure not to go too deep into the math world because if you learn too much math, you can’t talk to people anymore. So, I had to cut myself off. So, for instance, when I learned pi, I stopped myself at 10 digits. Yeah, yeah. Because I actually discovered a f',\n",
              "  'ormula when I was at Berkeley that for every extra digit of pi you learn, that’s one year your virginity is delayed. So, I had to cut myself off at 10. I could actually prove this theorem right now. I can prove it. You guys want a mathematical proof? We learn pie geometry sophomore year when most of us are about 15 years old. Hormones are raging. If you can’t even learn a single digit of pie, you don’t even remember that it starts with a three. When you’re 15 years old, it’s because you’re already having sex. That’s the only possible reason. This guy knows what I’m talking about, okay? But the average person learns three digits of pie. The average person knows it’s 3.14. Congratulations, you’re average. And what’s your reward for being average? You get to lose your virginity at the average age of 18. Okay, you already noticed a linear trend here. We got 15 plus 3 equals 18, right? I know you don’t come to comedy shows to do math, but when you watch my set, you ain’t got no fucking choice, okay? Now, if you’re learning more than three digits of pi, you’re losing your virginity in college. There’s no way. There’s no one that’s seen your problem who’s like, “Three went four one five.” Like, you’re going home, bro. It’s not happening tonight. If you learn more than seven, Master’s. Okay? If you learn more than 10, PhD. I have a friend who knows 100 digits of pi. Still a virgin, okay? Now, I… I learned 10 digits of pi like a badass, okay? So, I lost my virginity at… Plug it into the formula: 15 plus 10 equals 20 fucking five. Not 27, bro. 10 plus 15 is 25, my friend. You added an extra two. What kind of loose do you think I am, bro? 25, not 27. 27, I’d be off my family’s health insurance at that point, bro. I’m not an idiot. So, I lost my virginity at… Plug it into the formula: 15 plus 10 equa',\n",
              "  'ls 20 fucking five. Who’s the pussy now? 25 is the best age to lose your virginity. I lost my virginity in a rental car that I rented myself, okay? [Applause] You thought you were boss because you lost in mommy civic. I declined insurance on a Hertz, biatch! They cleaned up the mess. I just walked away like a champ. Three one four one five nine two six five three one four one five nine two six five. It’s actually a phone number in St. Louis. I text it every day. Still no response. Isn’t that crazy? Somebody in Missouri has the phone number of pi, but they’re in Missouri, so they have no idea. You wanted the math jokes. Not even paying attention, man. What the fuck, dude? Requesting shit. Not a jukebox up here, dude. So, yes, I’m a comedian now. And I recently got the most interesting compliment I’ve ever got in comedy. After a show, a guy comes up to me, and he was drunk. I knew he was drunk because he was angled backwards at like 35 degrees, and he just walked out to me. He’s like, “Carlin, Pryor, Chappelle, you’re right up here with them, brother.” And I was like, “Oh, that’s so awesome. Thank you so much. This was just a 15-minute set. You should come see my full hour.” He’s like, “No, this was enough,” and then he walked away. That’s where I’m at in comedy right now. You’re here for a special moment. Um, I am an American comedian. I’m Palestinian-American. Thank you so much. I’m openly Palestinian. I was closeted for 30 years and then finally came out last year with the hadiths because they made Twitter a safe space, and I love safe spaces. Americans still don’t know a lot about Palestinians, and I guess it makes sense because there hasn’t been too many famous ones in history. And I guess the ones who are famous, people just don’t know who they are. Um, famous Palestinians: Yasser Ara',\n",
              "  'fat and Jesus. Who are those guys? Oh, and DJ Khaled. DJ Khaled is ours. DJ Khaled is ours. Isn’t that crazy? Those are the two most famous Palestinians in history. Jesus and DJ Khaled. They’re very similar. Jesus didn’t need a college when you think about it. In fact, when they came out with the New Testament, they were like, “Another one. We’re the best, baby. Christians. We don’t pass.” People always ask me, “What is it that the Palestinians want?” And I’ll tell you right now, it’s very simple. They want the right of return to their homeland that many of them left circa 1948. It’s called right of return. Those are the only three words you need to know. And there’s one country blocking it from happening, and it happens to be the country we’re in. The country that I love, the country that took my virginity, bless you. The country that my school protected with the nukes is the one vetoing Palestine from being recognized and not having the right of return to their homeland. And it’s hard to make jokes about this. It’s conflicting. I put one on YouTube. I said, “Of course, the United States is not going to support Palestinian right of return because if we did, we’d suddenly owe Native Americans a country, right?” Joke did about the same on YouTube. Of course, a lot of angry people commenting. One guy was fuming. He was… He wrote in all caps. Uh, either he was angry or his caps lock button was broken. I admit, it could be either situation. Sees my right of return video and he comments, “I hope you go back to where you came from.” I was like, “This guy gets it.” [Laughter] [Applause] All right. Being Palestinian-American, less of an identity, more of an identity crisis. My dad was born a few hours out of Jerusalem. My mom was born in Utah. So, both places where Jesus got resurrected. Now, my ',\n",
              "  'great-grandma was born in Bethlehem, and I tell people this, they’re like, “Oh, Bethlehem, Pennsylvania?” I’m like, “Yeah, that’s the one. She was Amish. She grew up in the Holy Land next to Scranton. She knew the three wise men from Dunder Mifflin, come on! The birthplace of our savior, Bethlehem, P.A.” Now, everybody knows Bethlehem, birthplace of Jesus, the savior of most people in this country. Yet, if you ask most people in this country to point it out on a map, they’re pointing to Pennsylvania, there’s a problem. But it’s not our fault. It’s a very difficult geopolitical question. I had to look it up just for this joke. Yeah, my niece asked me over Christmas. My niece is five years old. She said, “Where’s Jesus from?” I was like, “Bethlehem. Nailed it, right?” She was like, “Where’s Bethlehem?” I was like, “Oh shit, here we go. I gotta give her the simplest answer you can a five-year-old, but I also gotta keep it real, you know?” So I was like, “Okay, um, well, technically, Bethlehem is in Palestine, but America, we don’t recognize Palestine as a country, so technically it’s in the Palestinian territories, um, specifically the West Bank, not the Gaza Strip. It was part of Israel, but they handed over to the Palestinian National Authority in 1995 under the interim agreement of 7.5 section 2 of the U.N. resolution at the Oslo Accords. Thanks, Bill Clinton. Uh, this was pre-Monika, never mind. Uh, but of course, before that, it was British Mandate Palestine, and before that, the Ottoman Empire, and before that, a conquest during the Crusades, and before that, another conquest, and before then, another conquest. Before that, another conquest. Ah, times back then, people were crazy. Before that, the Roman Empire, because it was the law. Uh, before that, Judea, shout out to my Zionists. U',\n",
              "  'h, before that, the Canaanites. Yes, we Canaanites is what they did. Not say. I made that up, um, uh, before that, random tribes from Africa. Uh, Black Lives Matter. And uh, before that, it was the dinosaurs, if you believe in those, believe that they teach you those? And of course, before all of that, it was just lots and lots and lots of rocks. Uh, which, as we know, belonged to the Palestinians. Now, one could argue that it still is in Israel, technically, because Israel technically occupies the West Bank. But of course, Israel would say that’s not the case because that’s illegal under international law, under many, many counts. Don’t tell the U.N.! JK, they already know. Oh my god, it’s a mess. Everybody knows, literally everybody knows, except most of the people in the country that could actually vote to stop it. God bless Pennsylvania. Merry Christmas.” And that was the answer that I gave her in about 90 seconds flat, if you ever wanted to know where Bethlehem is. And I think she liked it because she immediately responded with, “Is Santa Claus real?” I said, “100% Santa Claus was real. We definitely recognize Santa Claus.” She’s like, “What are you getting me for Christmas?” I said, “I gave you the gift of Palestine. What do you want? Like, people usually pay to see my shows. I gave it to you free of charge.” She was like, “Free Palestine.” I was like, “Exactly!” I knew this was a safe space. As you can imagine, um, these jokes don’t do well all over the country. I did that bit not too long ago, and a guy comes up to me after and he’s like, “Hey buddy, let me give you some advice.” I’m like, “Oh, this is going to be good. This is why we do it. We come for the laugh, stay for the advice.” He’s like, “Let me give you some advice.” I’m like, “Lay it on me, buddy.” He’s like, “Don’t do ',\n",
              "  'political comedy. It really divides the crowd.” I was like, “Wow, news flash. I’d never heard something more obvious in my life. Of course, political comedy divides the crowd. That’s what makes it fun. You say something divisive, press people’s buttons, split some hairs, and if you’re good enough, you can bring them back together with a really bad pun. That’s what makes comedy fun. If you think about it, everybody loves political comedy, just not at the same time! That’s how it works. You sit and you wait your turn till the comedian says something you like and stand for. You clap, you cheer, you go wild, and then for the rest, you politely shut your freedom hole. That’s democracy, baby.” And he’s like, “Well, if this is democracy, then I’m giving you my vote.” I’m like, “No, your vote is to laugh or not laugh. You’re trying to suppress other voters’ rights at this point is what you’re doing.” He’s like, “Buddy, I’m just trying to give you some advice.” I said, “You’re giving me material, buddy, is what you’re doing.” And then, this was the best part, he leans in and he said, “Well, buddy, you should trust me ‘cuz I’m a magician.” I said, “What? Wait, what? What just happened? What did you just say? You just said, ‘Trust me I’m a magician.’ I don’t think anybody’s ever said that before in any language. This guy literally said ‘Trust me, I trick people for money.’ Trust me, I am a magician. I believe the saying is, ‘Don’t trust me, I deceive people on a regular basis.’ That is like, he might as well just pulled a dove out of his hat like, ‘Trust me, I’m a magician.’ Just comes out… ‘You’re a magician, and I’m dividing the crowd? Maybe stop sawing your audience members in half, you divisive mofo.’ Political comedy is fun because you divide the crowd, and then if you’re good enough, you can u',\n",
              "  'ndivide them.” He’s like, “How do you undivide a crowd?” I’m like, “Trust me, I’m a math comic. Um, you split a crowd apart, and if you’re funny enough, you can bring them back together.” And he’s like, “Do you really believe that?” I was like, ♪ Do you believe in magic? ♪ ♪ Free Palestine ♪ And then the truth came out. He said, “Hey man, what made me upset is that I’m from Israel, and I don’t like you talking bad about my people.” I was like, “I wasn’t doing that. I was just, uh, telling a joke about historical accuracy. That– that was all I was doing.” And he says, “Yeah, but now when people meet me and I tell them I’m for Israel, they think I’m bad.” I’m like, “That’s not my fault. That’s between you and your government, buddy. Like, use your democracy over there.” And like, I get it. You want to critique someone’s comedy, but it’s like, you know, this is the country that I live in. Like, I would never go to Iraq, go to an Iraqi Comedy Club, see an Iraqi comedian on stage be like, “You know America, this freedom you gave us looks a lot like bombs.” And after the show, I’m like, “Hey buddy, can you tone it down with that whole anti-American thing? Trying to get some pussy out here, you know what I’m saying? Trying to get laid in your country, not making me look good.” And I felt for this guy, but I just think, I think he ran out of words because he is a magician, and, uh, and then he just said, “Look man, I heard your Israel-Palestine jokes, and you’re just not building any bridges with those.” And I said, “I’m not trying to build bridges. I’m trying to get laughs, uh, that’s the point of comedy. I’m not like when I go to a show, I don’t hope that people throw little tiny toy bridges at the stage, you know. I’m like hoping for hahas instead, you know, plus I’m Palestinian. We don’t do b',\n",
              "  'ridges, we do tunnels, you know what I mean? So, it’s, it’s like a bridge, you just don’t know that it’s happening at the time. I guess what I’m saying is, we’re more connected than you know, you know. See you on the other side.” I already know some people are reacting like, “Oh my God, did he just make a joke about the Palestinian tunnels?” And you’re right. I’m sorry. I meant to use the term gender-neutral maintenance holes. I feel bad for a lot of you guys right now, just like a lot of you’re like, “This is not the kind of comedy that I just wanted. I wanted to go home and stuff. It’s so sturdy, and like, it’s so intense. I didn’t want to cut ha-ha.” This is the point where I want to commend you for still being here, because if you like Samuel Obeid, you come to a show, and you have to be able to listen to the four Ps, okay? Problems, Palestine, puns, and pussy. That’s right, that’s right. If you can tolerate all four, you are a true Samuel Obeid fan. People always critique me like, “Why don’t you just focus on one thing?” No, I want fans who like the whole package, man. That’s why I started with like the pussy stuff, you know? Because people like, you know, “You’re not playing to the crowd. Who’s gonna like the Palestinian material if you open with all that dirty stuff?” I’m like, “But that’s the point. I’m trying to get the people like, ‘Oh yeah, pussy. I’m listening. Palestine. I should. I’m learning,’ you know what I mean? Like, there’s a method to this.” I will say that, um, I did recently find out that my parents, when they first found out about me, were considering an abortion. And… thanks for laughing, but I… I’m not saying this to get any any sympathy or anything. I’m just saying there has been attempts to cancel me, and you wouldn’t be the first. How do we feel about cancel c',\n",
              "  'ulture in this room, by the way? How do we feel about the cancer culture? Okay, most people don’t like it. Most comedy crowds don’t like cancel culture because they want their comedians still here. Uh, I, on the other hand, I love cancel culture. It clears out more room at the top for me, right? Give me that Louis CK spot, boom. Let’s go. D’Elia’s out. Yeah, buddy. Bad day? Diseased? I’m sorry. Let’s go. It’s like reverse Tetris, just clearing out more space. Yeah, dude. Love cancel culture. I give it a 10 out of 10. But the 10s cancel out, so I give it a one. It’s all funny game so it happens to you. I don’t really cross the line in comedy. My, my goal in comedy is, I like to find the line, walk up to it, wave, and then peace out, um, because like every crowd has its own mind. When you, you’re all individual people, but when you come into a room with other people, you form crowd mind, and you guys all have a collective line. I think your, your guys’ was, uh, I don’t know what was the COVID stuff. So he said, “Cocaine.” Oh, your line is cocaine. Got it. Okay. That’s, that’s a better joke. I found the… Yeah, I could, that part of the room, I fucking know that shit. I found your lines. They’re in your noses. Every crowd has its line. I was doing a show in Berkeley not too long ago, and the line was just me showing up. Doing a show in Berkeley is just like constantly doing limbo. It’s just like, lines, lines, lines, lines, lines. So, I’m doing a joke about the ancient Mayans, okay? Ancient Mayans. A woman gets up in the middle of my joke and she was like, “Racist asshole!” I was like, “Whoa, what’s going on?” She’s like, “You’re talking about my people!” I was like, “The Ancient Mayans?” I was looking for like a time portal in the room, feeling for a draft, you know, like, “Is she an ancient',\n",
              "  ' Mayan?” She’s wearing Uggs, you know. She’s got holes in her jeans. Did they do that? How did the Ancient Mayans dress? Then, I was mad at my education. I was like, “Damn you, Berkeley! Why didn’t you tell me they still walk among us?” So, I stopped my joke and apologized. I want you to leave here feeling better than when you came. So, like, if I piss you off, I genuinely will apologize, like I’ll apologize directly to your ego, you know what I mean? Like, I’ll walk up to your ear like, “I’m sorry, baby,” you know, like metaphorically cradling you, giving you whatever you need because I want you to have that feeling. I’ll give you this sincere apology, and then I’ll proceed to liking you less than other people, but that’s not your problem. So, I said, “I’m sorry, ma’am. I didn’t mean to offend you. Where’s your family from specifically?” And she was like, “Peru.” I was like, “That’s the Incas, you fucking idiot. Get the fuck out of here! What the fuck are you? You’re just doing ‘paint all indigenous people with a broad brush’? That’s racist!” And that’s how you out-Berkeley Berkeley. I’m the biggest pussy of them all. I am the tiger. What was the Mayan joke? What was the Mayan joke? Thank you. That’s a great question. This was the Mayan joke, um, and it was a… believe me, it was a joke that I wrote like in my first year of comedy. Um, so the joke was, um, the Mayans predicted that civilization was gonna end in 2012, but their civilization ended in 1606. I guess they didn’t know what the fuck they were talking about. It’s like every time I tell a girl I’m gonna last all night. I’m not a prophet, you know? Not a bad joke for a first year of comedy. It’s crazy. I didn’t even… One more thing I want to say is like, before I came on stage, I got locked in the green room. We were trying to, lik',\n",
              "  'e, for five minutes, I didn’t know if I was gonna make it up here or like if I was gonna have to kick down the door to come up and do my special taping. But that would have been the most boss-like special opening ever. I went to Berkeley. Comedy is a safe space because we are supposedly supposed to be able to say whatever we feel. But if you get offended, there’s nothing wrong with that. There’s this kind of stigma now that if you get offended at a joke that a good comedian tells, there’s something wrong with you, and I just want to make it clear that there’s nothing wrong with you if you get offended at something a comedian says. That just means that you’re human. That’s all that means. I’m concerned if you don’t get offended like, “I went to the comedy show, and I was okay with everything.” Like, get checked out, now. There is something wrong. You need to go to therapy. Everybody has their line, and it’s not a Berkeley line, but it’s a line, you know what I mean? I wanted to know if I was a human. I wanted to know where my line was, so I went to a comedy show. I sat in the back, had some drinks, which is just like a lube. It’s like emotional lube, you know? By the end of the show, I was like a Drake album, just filled with incoherent feelings. I was angry, but I didn’t know why. I was like a confused social justice warrior. Then the comedian said something that, like, triggered me. He made a joke about virgins, which triggered the 24-year-old in me, and it’s like, “How dare he?” I felt the pussy just bubbling up inside. I was like, “No, no, he didn’t. I’m gonna find him on Instagram and message him.” Picked up my phone, I started to DM him. Took me like 15 minutes to find his handle because I was drunk, and I was about to send him a message on how dumb his joke was, and then I stopped m',\n",
              "  'yself immediately. I was like, “What am I doing? I’m a grown-ass comedian.” So, I put down the phone, I took the high road, and instead of DMing, I went home, I listened to Jack Johnson, and I was fine the next day because this is the solution. It gets it out of your system. I call it the self-juicing cleanse, alright? And you have to do it yourself. You have to do the work yourself. You can’t have someone else do it for you. You got to burn those calories to really, really get it out. This may be vulgar to some of you, but I’m telling you right now, if you ever find yourself getting upset or angry or just plain all triggered from something a comedian says, one, that’s okay, and two, you can go fuck yourself. And you can trust me because I’m a pussy! Thank you so much, everybody. I’m Samuel Obeid. [Music] [Applause] \\n Your email address will not be published.

Okay, K.J., why don’t you tell our viewers how you came up with this fabulous idea? Well, I used to design these dolls called “little pooples” that you’d put on the end of your toilet, and then I got tired because I wasn’t able to eat ’em. So, should I be sharing personal information with this person? It just… It helps with banter. I love this little guy. What is his name?

If you have COVID-19, getting a good night’s sleep can be rough. But starting now, your pesky pains are over. From the makers of MrPillow comes a brand-new product, the MrPillow Coronavirus Vaccine. Hi. I’m Steve Windell, the creator of MrPillow and MrPillowPlus. For 20 years, I’ve dedicated my life to making firm yet fluffy pillows that don’t break the bank. So, I thought, “Why not take the magic of MrPillow and use it to make a vaccine for coronavirus?” So, how does it work? It’s pretty simple, actually. The MrPillow Vaccine is made from thousands of tiny microscopic pillows shrunken down to the size of the deadly virus. Once injected into the bloodstream, these individualized pillows insert themselves under the novel coronavirus and lull it into a restful slumber. The virus now defenseless, the body’s immune cells can go to work. That’s how we here at MrPillow put the science back in sleep science. I got my friendly MrPillow Vaccine in the mail, and three days later, I already feel immune to COVID and ready to mix and mingle. I’m even going to a pool party later. Thank you, MrPillow. And I had COVID for three weeks and then I got it again! Hey! I think I’ll load up on that vaccine right now. Nurse? I feel better already. Order the MrPillow Coronavirus Vaccine for just four easy payments of $99, or $12,000 with insurance. The MrPillow Coronavirus Vaccine works.

How are you dealing with this whole “new normal” thing? Listen, Sarah Cooper, I’m not going outside until coronavirus is a memory, okay? Like, you can go back in the textbook and be like, “Damn, y’all remember coronavirus? That shit was crazy, right?” [chuckles] Yeah. So until then, I’m staying my ass in the house.

Well, you know, I like to work out, gotta keep that ass tight, sharp. [chuckling] Real hot-girl shit. [Sarah] Yeah, real hot-girl stuff. Any tips you can give us for working out at home? Definitely.

Yes, Sarah Cooper, yeah, it is. I been doing this every day for quarantine and let me tell you, I feel great. Well, you look great. Thanks. You, too, can look like this.

Let’s look at your file and see how your ratings are doing. I forgot. I can’t read. All right. [clears throat] Looks like 35% of our audience likes that you’re Black, 30% of our audience doesn’t like that you’re Black, 50% of our audience doesn’t know you’re Black, but thankfully, 80% of our audience feels extremely threatened by you, Sarah. It’s that attitude of yours. I don’t think I have an attitude. [man] There it is. There it is. The boss didn’t hire you to be aggressive. The boss hired you to be a non-threatening Black woman like Tootie and Lisa Turtle, and that other one. Lovable, but forgettable. Well, I think it might be a little confusing, because I’m named Sarah, and I feel like when my parents named me Sarah, a white lady just moved into my body and gentrified my whole personality, you know? Like, my mom would cook jerk chicken– I love jerk chicken. He does. He’s a jerk. He loves the chicken. I love it. And I’d be like, “Oh, this is too spicy.” And she’d say, [in Jamaican accent] “There are children around the world, all they get for dinner ',\n",
              "  \"is bread and water.” And I’d be like, “That actually sounds pretty good.” Like, a scone and a chai latte. Yes, a scone and chai tea latte would be perfect. Any time of the day. Um… That would be really great ’cause I was born in Jamaica, but moved here when I was three. Jamaica. I knew it. I actually watched these characters when I was little. I mean, Tootie and Lisa and Hilary and… and… Um… And that other one. I mean, these characters inspired me, you know? I feel like they ran so that I could sing. But you can’t sing, which is why you’re on the morning show and not on Broadway. Okay, I will tone it down. [director] Yeah. Stick to the news. All right? Leave politics out of it. Got it. Thank you. [man] Better go. Yeah. Marv, do you think I should buy another gun? Lorraine, what are you talking about? Are you crazy? Of course you should buy another gun. Thank you.

This is Connie Chung with the president this morning. Mr. President, what is your plan to unite the country? [Trump’s voice] I’m not a big fan of sharks either. I don’t know how many votes I’m gonna lose. I have people calling me up, “Sir, we have a fund to save the shark, it’s called ‘Save the Shark.'” I say, “No, thank you.” Oh, no. Mr. President, I was asking you about uniting the country. I think I am actually humble. I’m much more humble than you would understand. [mutters] Mr. President, I asked you about– Excuse me.

As we’ve previously reported, a huge shake-up in the CEO world happened last Friday when we learned the CEO of Techtech Corp is actually a robot. Strangely, no one even noticed for several months. Live in studio via Camrojex technology, please welcome 8008s. Thanks, Sarah. It’s great to be here. [Sarah] Thank you for taking time out of your busy schedule. Well, I can multitask better than my human counterparts, Sarah. For example, right now, I’m chatting with you, doing Joe Rogan’s podcast, and kicking off a workplace diversity program all at the same time. Okay, so is it safe to assume you’re programmed to simply do everything your predecessors did? Unlike Elon Musk, I have a human side. [Scooter chuckles] Elon Musk. I was made by a great group of guys who really take social change seriously. For example, I’m programmed with the complete knowledge of feminist content such as Sex and the City, Cosmo and “H',\n",
              "  'ot Girl Summer.” I’m not sure I’d consider that feminist– I’ve also learned about the Black experience in America by watching all three Barbershop movies, and the Beauty Shop spin-off. Okay, again, I’m not sure we– I’m sorry. I’m being told that I’m getting off track. As president and CEO, my number-one job is to make my shareholders happy. But that’s kind of been the problem, hasn’t it? Big businesses just focusing on money, making myopic business moves that leave the whole country with more disparity and… How are you doing that? Camrojex technology. Oh, wow. Just relax. This is really inappropriate. But technically, you’re a robot and I haven’t had a massage in months. [sensual song playing] That feels incredible. [sighs] Hold on, we have some breaking news. It’s been reported that Robot CEO 8008s has been fired by its board of directors after making unwanted advances toward an office printer. That printer knew exactly what it was doing. It was always asking me to make a copy. Because that’s its job. And it’s not just a printer, it has a name. HP Printer/Scanner/Copier 500s, whose side of the story I’m sure we all want to hear. Scooter, can we get HP Printer/Scanner/Copier 500s on the cloud system? Thank you so much for joining us, HP Printer/Scanner/Copier 500s. Tell us what happened. [beeping] Okay, wait, wait. I’ll, uh… I’ll make a public statement. Okay? Just give me two seconds to think. After eight months of careful soul-searching, I’ve decided to address the hideous allegations against me. I have not, nor have I ever mistreated or abused a printer/scanner/copier. I value printers. My printer… is a printer. HP Printer/Scanner/Copier 500s, is there anything you want to say? [whirring and beeping] Sounds like we’re getting a fax. [fax machine printing] “F*ck you, 8008s.” I will now step away to spend time with my family. [theme music playing] Wow. AI has come so far. [Scooter] Three, two, one. We’re out. Can’t believe he’s a robot. Ladies and gentlemen, please give a big Allstate Arena parking lot welco',\n",

I’ve been everywhere. Singapore, you name it. Tonight’s show is at the Allstate Arena in Rosemont. Pretty exciting for me. [chuckles] I’m going to begin by introducing you to my family. I call them my family because some I see often and others when I least expect them. Can everyone see these? I’m going to shuffle these cards and you tell me when to stop. [horn honking] [Sarah] Okay, I haven’t started shuffling yet. [horn toots] Now I’m shuffling. [horns honking] Got it. Now I’m going to show you all this card. Can everyone see this card? [horns honking] Does anyone work here? [horns honking] Can you take this card and show it? Yeah. Don’t show it to me. Oh, okay. During COVID, I’m also a teacher in a Zoom Room. But this… This is where I come alive. Beep when you’ve seen it. And– [horn beeps] [horn beeps] [man] I’ve never worked with a magician. I was a Frankenstein at a haunted house once, though. So, you know, I’m used to being around performers. Is this your card? I had to get out of that racket ’cause of the Illuminati. You know, they want to get you. [horn beeps] It’s like, not for me. Nope, I’ll stick to parking lot attendant. That’s the life for me. Simple. [car horns blaring] I think it went okay. Yeah. I might have to buy giant cards for shows like these in the future. Um… I don’t know. There’s a lot of beeping. So, when is this gonna be on? I just wanna make sure that I catch it. [man] Uh, sometime next year. Okay. Do you want to see another trick? No? Okay. [woman] We followed the guidelines. We reopened when it was safe. But now, it’s not safe again. [crowd] Aw! [man 1] Honestly? [woman] Orgies. Maybe later. [man 2] Damn it. Wonderful place. Wonderful. Oh, my goodness. Unbelievable. Oh, hello. My name is Natalie, and this is my husband, John. Hi, there. [chuckles] Welcome to Mar-a-Lago. We love it here. It is beautiful. You he',\n",
              "  'ar me? Oh, it’s gorgeous. I know what you’re thinking. “Do they allow Black people at Mar-a-Lago?” Um, we’re here! Right? Laugh it off. We are Black-ish, though. Last time we checked. Last time we checked, we were. Yes. And we’ve actually met the president. He saw us… Yes, we did. …and he said that we are his two favorite Black people. And he says it every single time. Every time. Mmm-hmm. Such a charismatic personality he has. He’s such a celebrity. We actually got married here. Um, not in the big ballroom, but on the property. So it was still beautiful. Yes. Yeah. We’re not allowed in there right now. We’re not allowed in there yet, but there is a small room off to the side with a private entrance, very exclusive. [laughs] And they said we can go in there whenever we want. We can stay in there if we want to. Anytime. And then, one night, we actually got locked in there. And let’s just say it was very fortuitous. Yes, it got kind of hot in there. [ominous music playing] We just love it here. Just surrounded by all our friends. Surrounded by all of our friends, which is the most important part. We got you in our hearts. Right on. [Sarah] If you like skateboarding dogs, you’re gonna wanna stick around after Everything’s Fine for Thinking Outside the Bachs with Jordana Bachman. [Jordana] I don’t know what this is about to be, but okay! [Sarah] Coming up at the twelve o’clock hour. Let’s do the weather segment. Love the weather. Love the weather! [Lorraine] Mmm. [theme song playing] Okay, weather segment in three, two… And now, let’s check in on how the sky’s doing today with our meteorologist, Andrea Steele. Thanks, Sarah. Well, we’re looking at some real clear skies today, up to 75 degrees. Absolutely beautiful out. Let’s look ahead at the five-day forecast. Tuesday, we’re gonna see a bit of rain, but break out that summer gear as temperatures shoot up to a whopping 103 degrees. Wednesday, out of nowhere, there’s gonna be a ferocious hailstorm with sustained winds up to 75-plus miles per hour. Scooter, you may',\n",
              "  ' wanna board up your windows. My windows are always boarded up. You know that weird house in your neighborhood that’s got all the boards up in the windows, and everyone thinks, “Is that an abandoned hospital?” That’s my place. Excellent. Thursday, you might wanna break out the sunscreen again, because it’s gonna be a hot one. 123 degrees with a humidity index so high, a friend of mine who works at the EPA called me crying. He’s a grown man. Friday, we shoot down to negative 12 degrees with a windchill index we weren’t even able to calculate using a Doppler 8000 technology. It’s gonna be a cold one, folks. Most likely not survivable, so wear a jacket. And Saturday, temperatures radically return to breezy 75 degrees. However, that isn’t just a cute graphic we made up. We’re actually projecting literal flaming snowmen to be walking the streets with some possible fire tornado watches in effect. Everything’s fine with the weather. I’m Andrea Steele. Back to you, Sarah. Andrea, I’m sorry, but that forecast is– Insane? Uh, yeah. You think? I mean, I’ve been doing the weather for 17 years, Sarah, and I have never seen anything like this in my entire lifetime. You think I like telling people they’re gonna die, or their skin might peel off if they run to the grocery store? No one should be going outside unless they absolutely have to. [heart beating] Scooter? [narrator] Everything was not fine. [exhales deeply] Scooter, are you asleep? [narrator] Had the world gone mad? Andrea, are you okay? [scoffs] Am I okay? This b!tch. Am I okay? Um… No, actually, ’cause we got a bat disease just floating around in the sky, there’s a new natural disaster every motherf*cking day, factories destroying the environment. Look at this damn forecast behind me. This is the first time I’ve left my house in months! All it takes is one wrong motherf*cker to breathe on me funny, and I swear to God… Scooter, are we still on a nine-second delay? The woman who presses that button stopped coming in weeks ago. Well, in that case, let me just say th',\n",

We’ll be right back. [buzzer sounds] Great. We’re out. Nice. Wow. So that’s your house I walk by every day. [Scooter] Yeah. Ah. My kids are terrified to go past there. [chuckling] That’s the one. It doesn’t look like anyone’s lived there in hundreds of years. [Scooter] That’s my place. [Andrea] Interesting. Well, it’s safe. It’s spooky. [Scooter] Yeah. It’s awful there. Everybody ready? Here we go. Five, four, three, two, one. Welcome back to Everything’s Fine. I’m Sarah Cooper. And now for our top story, an exclusive look inside that now-famous Access Hollywood bus. [man’s voice] She used to be great. Still beautiful. [Trump’s voice] I moved on her. She was down in Palm Beach. I moved on her and I failed, I’ll admit it. Whoa. I did try and fuck her. She was married. That’s huge news there. [Trump’s voice] No, Nancy… This was… And I moved on her very heavily. In fact, I took her out furniture shopping. She wanted to get some furniture. I said, “I’ll show you where they have some nice furniture.” Took her out furniture– I moved on her like a b!tch. But I couldn’t get there, and she was married. All of a sudden I see her, she’s now got the big phony tits and everything. She’s changed her look. Sheesh, your girl’s hot as shit. In the purple. [all] Whoa! [Billy Bush’s voice] Yes! Yes! The Donald has scored! [all laughing] Oh, my man! Wait, you gotta look at me when you… [indistinct chatter] Thumbs up. [Trump’s voice] You’re a pussy. You gotta put the thumbs up. Gotta get the thumbs up. You can’t be too happy. [man 1] Let me… [man 2] That’s funny. You and I will walk out. Oh, my God. [indistinct chatter] Maybe it’s a different one. Better not be the publicist. No, it’s her. [Trump’s voice] Yeah, that’s her. With the gold. I gotta use some Tic Tacs, just in case I start kissing her.

We’re ready. Make me a soap star. How about a hug for the Donald? He just got off the bus. Want a little hug? [Trump’s voice] Absolutely. Melania said this was okay. Hug for the Bushy? I just got off the bus. Oh! Bushy. [Bush’s voice] Here we go. Excellent. Excellent. Excellent. You’ve got a nice costar here. Yes. Absolutely. [Trump’s voice] After you. [heart beating] Great. We’re out. Nice. Scooter, what is happening? [both laughing] [Lorraine] This job is made for you, Marvin. Yeah, it keeps me out of trouble, as they say. Everything’s fine. Three, two, one, and we’re in. Sarah. And now, a little preview of what’s coming on after Everything’s Fine. We’ll have Jordana Bachman of Thinking Outside the Bachs, followed by Sandy Manderson, Miyoko Loco, and then, Andre Cole Watkins of Watkins the News. Stick around, it’s gonna be a great day. Isn’t it, Scooter? Miyoko Loco. [chuckles] A little help here. Save me. How about Sandy Manderson? Her face froze? Help. Tomorrow, something bad happens to your favorite celebrity. We’ll have a full report. Now, it’s over to Jordana Bachman for Thinking Outside the Bachs. Jordana, how are you doing? I’m doing good, girl. How are you, sister-friend? I’m doing so good.

That’s how I feel, just seeing you through a little box. What have you been up to? Girl, I’ve been up to so much. I’ve locked up every Black man in my life. I put my dad in a closet, my brother in a closet, my uncle in a closet, to make sure they live another day. Wow. Where do you put your clothes? [laughing] Oh, my God. What are we doing? Scooter. I’m sorry? And now, it is over to you, Jordana Bachman. Oh, no, girl, I couldn’t. I couldn’t. I have to pass it back to you, Sarah Cooper. You’re so funny. Back to you.

[laughter] Just taking the temperature of the room. I don’t know who’s here, you know? [laughter] [groans disgustedly] “That’s a weird one to start.” All right. [laughter] Yeah, I’ve been on this, uh, phenomenal tour, and I’ve, uh, I’ve met people I never thought I would meet in my life. Recently I met a supermodel, which is wild because… Well, I don’t think she wanted to meet me. I should be clear. I was in a… a fancy hotel in Toronto, and somebody that worked there, they go to her, “Hey, he’s a comedian.” And she was like, “Okay.” [laughter] And then they go, “She’s a supermodel.” I was like, “I can see.” [laughter] And what struck me is that they are so much better-looking than you think they’re gonna be. Like, you see in a magazine or on your phone, and you’re like, “She’s pretty.” But in person, you’re like, “What the fuck is happening right now?” [laughter] And then you realize that it’s a genetic freak. [crowd chuckles] It is. If you are a supermodel, you are a freak. You are no different than a seven-foot-tall man. [laughter] I don’t know if you’ve ever met a seven-footer. I have. It is unsettling. All right? You basically… you go, like, “Am I a child? What… What is happening?” This woman was so unbelievably good-looking. Like, five seconds into our conversation, I stopped speaking and listening. All right? [laughter] I was looking at her like she was at the zoo. I was like… [laughter] I was like, “Let me see your ears.” Was looking for flaws. [laughter] She was absolutely perfect. And then my next thought was, “Why can’t my wife just drown?” You know? [laughter] [scattered applause] She knows. I ',\n",
              "  'told her. She knows. [laughter] She’s like, “You know I can swim, right?” “I know. Doesn’t matter if you can swim. It matters if a jury believes you can.” So… [laughter] [snorts] I’ve, uh… I’ve been to unbelievable places because of this job. It’s… It’s really crazy. I’ve… I’ve seen amazing places. Been to Rome. Hong Kong. Machu Picchu. All because of this job. And then, there’s other days. [crowd chuckling] Like, I had to go to Topeka, Kansas to do a show. [laughter] We went because they bought tickets, but we got the fuck out right away. [laughter] There was something cool that happened there, which is that my show there was protested by the Westboro Baptist Church. Uh… [mumbles] [cheers and applause] Don’t know if you know them. Sometimes they’re in the news. [crowd chuckles] If you’re like, “Oh, really? There’s a church in the news? But why?” [laughter] Well, sometimes they also protest dead soldiers’ funerals, cool shit like that. And… I was backstage, and my tour manager came in the room, he goes, “Westboro Baptist Church is here.” I was like, “To see the show? Really?” [laughter] And he was like, “No.” Said, “They’re protesting.” And they were out front with their dumb fuckin’ signs. [crowd chuckling] Their homemade signs ’cause they’re poor. Uh… [laughter] They had signs made that said, “Tom is a sinner.” And I was like, “Yes.” [crowd cheering] [mumbles] Yeah. True. [cheers fade] [scattered applause] Then they had, like, real hateful signs too that said, uh, like, “God hates gays.” But didn’t say “gay.” [laughter] It was another word. [laughter continues] [laughter swells] Your dad says it when the Cardinals lose. You know, like, uh… [laughter, cheering] [scattered applause] All right, your uncle. Somebody says it. Uh… [laughter] I took offense. Not so much to the word as the implication. That God hates gays. I don’t think that’s true. I think God has a people problem. There are too many people, and that is not gay people’s fault. [laughter] [cheers, applause] Because they butt fuck. I have to spell everything out? [laughter] Jesus. You can nut as hard as you want in somebody’s ass over and over and over, and something will come out, but it’s not a baby. Uh… [audience member whistles] [cheering] I mean… [cheer',\n",
              "  'ing continues] Still worth taking a picture of, I would argue. [laughter] Maybe give it a name. It’s not gonna live long. Uh… [hushed laughter] [laughter swells] I’m not gay, but… I am not above checking out a dude. I’m serious. Like, if I’m at the beach and there’s some super fucking, like… just yoked dude there, I’ll be like, “Hey.” “Nice.” [laughter] “Very nice.” “What’s your protein intake? What do you do?” “Cardio and lift? Of course.” Then a hot chick’ll walk by. “Get outta here. What are you doing?” [laughter] I think the gayest I ever was… [laughter] …was in February. [laughter] That’s when I did my shows in Los Angeles and Brad Pitt came to my show. [cheers and applause] Look… I do not know what year he was born or how many infants he consumes in a week, but that man… [laughter] …is stunning. All right? He came into my dressing room. I couldn’t make eye contact. Do you understand? I was like, “Hey, what’s up, man? How you doing?” [laughter] He goes, “Look at me.” I was like, “No.” [laughter continues] He goes, “Come on.” I said, “Shut up.” [laughter] [laughter continues] He goes, “Wanna give me a kiss?” I was like, “Yeah.” [laughter] [scattered applause] He goes, “Do it.” I went… Like that, I kissed him. [laughter] What? [crowd cheering] [audience member whistles] It wasn’t gay. [laughter] We took a bath later. That was gay. But… [laughter] …we talked about sports, so it balanced out, you know? I think you’re lucky if, in this life, you have, like, one real friend. You know? Like a true friend. I think I have four. Brad Pitt… [laughter] Um… I call him Pitt Stop ’cause we’re close. Uh… [laughter] And three other guys. People you know intimately. Like, you know each other’s secrets and stuff. Like, one of my friends, I know that he hides that he smokes weed from his wife. His name is Casey. Um… [laughter] One of my friends hides that he eats McDonald’s from his wife because he’s fat, and his name is Charlie. [laughter] [laughs devilishly] I guess they know now, but, you know… It’s wild when you find out something new after knowing people that long. I’ve known these guys, like, 25, 30 years. And I found out last week, so 25 years into these friendships, that I’m the only one who eats ass. In that entire group. I',\n",
              "  'sn’t that… crazy to you? Like… [cheers and applause] I guess I’m friends with a bunch of third-graders. I don’t know. Like… [laughter] One of the guys is newly in love too. Justin. Newly in love. Usually newly in love people are really on board, you know? Because everything’s rainbows and butterflies. Like, every day Justin’s like… [giggles gleefully] [laughter] [softly] “I’m in love.” I go, “That’s great. Did you eat her ass?” He’s like, “No.” I said, “So you don’t like her.” [laughter] And he was like, “No, I do.” And I said, “No, you don’t.” [laughter] “If you did, you’d give her the sweetest kiss of all.” [laughter] [scattered applause] And he goes, “That’s where she shits.” [laughter] I was like, “Yeah, don’t do it then.” [laughter] Wait a while, you know? Put her in a bath or something. That’s what I did with Brad. Now… [laughter] [cheers and applause] [applause fades] He goes, “You’re gross.” I was like, “Whatever.” And he said, “That’s what a dog does.” I said, “Excuse me?” [laughter] He goes, “A dog licks its own ass.” I said, “First of all, if I could lick my own ass, I wouldn’t be on tour, all right?” [laughter] I would do it until a doctor told me to stop. [laughter] He would have to sit me down and be like, “You’re not gonna have an ass soon if you don’t knock this off.” [laughter] I’d be like, “But it feels good.” [laughter] And he’d go, “I don’t trust you.” “Gonna put a cone around your neck.” I’d be like… “I can take it off with my paws.” Okay… [laughter fades, swells] Sorry, that was very stupid. I’m sorry. Now… I wish my dad was still here, you know? He died a few months ago. And I understand it’s part of life. It happens to everybody. And, uh, you know, I… I just… I had never visited somebody sick in the hospital. That was a new experience. It’s strange. If you’ve never done it, you get to the hospital and then somebody that works there goes, “Are you here to see…” And you go, “Yeah.” They go, “They’re gonna die soon.” And you’re like, “I thought so too. That’s why I came.” [laughter] And then they go, “You can go in there and watch that now.” And you’re like, “Thanks.” [scattered laughter] Personally, I feel like watching somebody die that you’re not trying to kill… is weird, you know? [laughter] L',\n",
              "  'ike, it’s different if you have somebody and you’re like… [laughter] And they go, “I’m dying.” Like, “I know. I want you dead. That’s why I’m doing this.” Probably feels good. I don’t know. I’m assuming it’s a euphoric feeling that you chase forever and ever. But… Ask Garth Brooks. He’ll tell you all about it. So… [loud cheering, applause] Come on. Where are the bodies, G? [cheering continues] Please. [cheering continues, fades] Connect the dots. Now… [laughter] I will tell you this. I did have a great conversation with my father. And I hope if you’re ever in that situation, you get it too. We had this great talk. And then he just drops this on me. He goes, “You know what I’ve never told you?” And I was like, “No. What?” And I was really hoping he was gonna say, you know, “There’s a treasure buried in the backyard.” [laughter] “It’s for you.” I go, “What have you never told me?” He goes, “I like a full bush on a lady.” And I was like, “What? What?” [laughter] [scattered applause] He goes, “Your mother keeps trimming hers.” I go, “Hey, what the fuck, man?” [laughter] I go, “Why are you telling me this?” And he goes, “Who am I supposed to tell?” [laughter] I go, “The Lord. You’re about to meet him.” And that was it. Then he said the “N” word and then he died. [mumbles] [laughter] [scattered cheers and applause] It was his last wish. All right? Yeah. Make-A-Wish was pissed. [laughter] They were like, “We don’t do that.” I was like, “Well, maybe you should.” If it was between saying that or meeting Tom Brady, I’d be like, “Fuck Tom Brady. I wanna say it.” [laughter] [scattered cheers and applause] [loud cheering] What really sucks about losing a parent is when you have kids. ‘Cause you want your parents to hang out with your kids, you know? Like, I have… I have two boys. They’re six and three. And they are boys. Like, real “he/him” s, if you know what I’m saying. Uh… [laughter] Don’t worry, we asked them. All right? [mumbles] They were like… [gruff] “Definitely.” We’re like, “Oh, okay.” “It’s up to you.” Now… [hushed laughter] [laughter slowly builds] [scattered applause] [loud cheering and applause] Luckily, I have a cousin that lives near me and he has two girls the same age. Six and three. So I get this wildly differen',\n",
              "  't experience up close and in person all the time. And these girls come over to my house. My God. What did I do wrong where I didn’t get girls? These girls… they show up, and they’re like, [softly] “Hello, Uncle Tommy.” [laughter] I go, “Hello to you.” [laughter] They go, “Where should we sit?” I go, “Try one of the chairs.” [laughter] And they go, “We would like to color.” I go, “Please.” [laughter] And then they sit down and they fucking color. [laughter] [scattered applause] An hour later, I can go into that room and they’re like… [humming pleasantly] [laughter] I go, “That’s nice.” “Where are my boys?” [laughter] “Are they in the house?” “Are they on the house?” [laughter] “Are they… Oh, they’re on the street. Fantastic.” I go out, like, “What the hell are you guys doing?” And they’re like, “We broke all the crayons…” [laughter] “…and we put ’em in the mailbox.” And I go… [laughter] [scattered applause] “Thank you. Thanks for doing that.” [cheers and applause] [audience member whistles] My six-year-old, he goes, “What would you do if a bad guy took your stuff?” [crowd chuckles] “Would ask him to give it back. I don’t know.” He goes, “I would get a sword.” [laughter] “I would cut him into pieces.” [laughter continues] “And I’d put the pieces in the mailbox.” I’m like… [laughter] “What are you doing with the mailbox, Dahmer?” [laughter] He goes, “You know Grandpa liked a full bush?” I go, “Hey…” [uproarious laughter] “Did he call you? How do you know?” [audience member whistles] [cheering] [man shouts indistinctly] My kids call me Tom. [laughter] So unnerving. Every day, the older one’s like… [gravelly] “How you doing, Tom?” I go, “Hey, I’m not your fuckin’ stepdad, all right?” [laughter] [scattered cheering] “I wish I was. It’d be a lot easier. But I’m not.” [cheering] [scattered applause] I go, “Call me Dad.” He goes, “I like Tom.” I’m like, “All right.” “What is up with your voice? You smoke cigarettes? Why do you talk like that?” The kid sounds like he fixes Harleys all day, but… [laughter] …he’s really just obsessed with the decades-old video game, Pac-Man. And he has Pac-Man questions morning, noon, and night. He woke me up at three in the morning. Let’s be clear. He doesn’t know how to wake somebody up. All ri',\n",
              "  'ght? He stood an inch from my face… [laughter] The most menacing way somebody can wake you up. He just goes, “Hey, Tom!” I was like, “Holy shit!” [laughter] “What?!” [laughter continues] He’s like, “What would happen… if Pac-Man needed a house?” I’m like, “What the… What?!” [laughter] He thinks I didn’t understand the question. [laughter] So he slows it down. For me. [laughter] He goes… [enunciated dramatically] “What would hap-pen… if…” I go, “He’d call a realtor.” I’m having a heart attack, all right? [laughter] “Pac-Man would get a loan and buy a house.” He’s like, “Okay, I’m going to bed.” I’m like, “All right. I’ll be up for three days. Thanks.” [laughter] [man whoops] At the same time, I have a monitor on the nightstand for the little guy. This dude stands up in bed and he goes, “What was that?” [laughter] So now I drag my ass into his room. He’s standing there with his gut out. You know they’re like… [laughter] [scattered applause] I’m like, “Do you own a Chevron? Why do you stand like that, dude?” [laughter] I go, “What?” He goes, “What was that?” I go, “What was what?” He goes, “That.” I go, “What’s that?” He goes, “What was that?” “I don’t know what you’re asking.” [laughter] He goes, “Was that the choo-choo?” I said, “What?” He goes… [exasperatedly] “Was it a choo-choo?” [crowd chuckling] He said it like, “Are you stupid enough…” [laughter] “…to turn our trains on without the conductor at the helm?” I go, “No.” He goes, “So, what was it?” I go, “I don’t know.” I said, “Maybe it was a choo-choo.” He goes, “Yeah. Don’t do that.” I was like, “Oh.” [laughter] “All right, al-Qaeda boss, go back in your cave.” [laughter fades to soft murmuring] He’s one of those kids that only laughs at real anger. I don’t know if you’ve ever met one of those peaches, but… See, most two and three-year-olds, they laugh at manufactured anger. Performative anger. You can go up to a kid that age and just go, “Rarrr. And they’re like…” [giggles joyfully] And this kid’s like, “Mm-mmm.” “I wanna see your blood pressure spike, man.” [laughter] The hardest I’ve ever seen him laugh, it’s not even close, is when he flushed my car keys down the toilet. [audience exclaims] It was my fault, I guess. I didn’t hang them up. I put them on the cof',\n",
              "  'fee table that I also bought. And… [laughter] I was laying on the couch. You know, it was a long day. I see his little ass come in the room, see the keys, and he’s like… [laughter] And I go, “No. Don’t.” And he picks them up and he goes, “Chase me.” [laughter] “Down the hall.” [laughter] I go, “Okay.” I give him a head start. He’s three. [laughter continues] When I stand up, I see him dip into the bathroom. I’m like… “No.” [laughter] And when I get there… [imitates toilet flushing] And I lose my shit. [laughter] I don’t yell at him. I’m just yelling at my life. You know? [laughter] I’m like, “Fuck!” [laughter continues] “No!” “Fuck!” And when I turn, he’s like, “That’s what I’m talking about.” [loud cheering, applause] [audience member whistles] “You’re a very funny guy.” [laughter] Fuckin’ kicked him in the chest. [laughter] [chuckles softly] God, those little shits. I took a shower with the, uh, six-year-old. He’s six, he’s not 16. Um… [laughter] If you’ve never showered with a six-year-old, let me give you some advice: make sure it’s yours. Otherwise… [laughter] It’s strange if you’re like, “What’s your name?” [laughter] He’s my son. And I wanted to, you know… I was trying to be like a fun dad. I… I offered him the showerhead. I thought it was a fun, in-the-moment thing. I go, “Do you wanna hold the showerhead?” And he was like, “Yeah.” [laughter] I give it to him. He just starts cleaning the shower. He’s like… [laughter] So, you know, after a minute, I’m like, “Can you wet me?” [laughter] And he goes, “Tom, relax. All right?” [laughter] [scattered applause, cheering] Then he looks up at me. He goes… [gravelly] “You have a big penis.” [laughter] “And I have a small one.” [laughter] I go, “Well, that’s ’cause mine’s hard, buddy.” [uproarious laughter] [cheers and applause] “We can make yours hard too. Just gotta go like…” [audience exclaims, laughs] [hushed murmurs, chatter] [disappointedly] “No.” [laughter] [laughingly] I did not jerk off my son. [laughter] I just always wanted to say that. Uh… [laughter] [sputters, laughs] [laughter] The truth is… The truth is, he really did say, “You have a big penis. And I have a small one.” And what I really said, immediately, and I mean in a split second of him saying that, I ',\n",
              "  'went… [gutturally] “No!” [laughter] And if you’re like, “Why did you shout, ‘No’?” I think because in that split second I thought, “I don’t want this to be some shit you start saying when we’re out.” [laughter] I don’t wanna be in a store where he’s like, “Do you have a big penis?” I’ll be like… “Yeah.” [laughter] “You know how it is.” Guy’s like, “I don’t know how it is.” “What the fuck was that all about?” [crowd chuckling] The worst part is that I scared him. When I shouted. That’s a terrible feeling. You see fear register on your kid’s face because of your overreaction. And I wanted to say the right thing. Or whatever the right thing is to say in that situation. Which I suppose would’ve been something like, “You didn’t do anything wrong. You made an observation.” “I shouldn’t have shouted. I’m sorry. Do you need therapy?” “I love you, man.” You know… [laughter] But it was all happening so quickly that I didn’t know what to say. So the fuckin’ best I could come up with? I went, “No!” “Just… shh.” [laughter] Now he’s totally confused. [crowd chuckling] He goes… [whispers] “You have a big penis.” [laughter] “I have a small one.” [laughter continues] I go, “Well, don’t fuckin’ tell anybody.” He goes, “Did Grandpa have a big penis?” I go, “I don’t remember. Haven’t seen it in a long time.” [laughter] “Let’s go ask Grandma.” [laughter continues] And we did. [scattered cheers] And he didn’t. [laughter] [scattered applause] [loud cheering] [audience member whistles] For the record, neither do I. [laughter] I wanna make that perfectly clear to everybody here. I do not have a big penis. But… next to a six-year-old… [laughter] …I got a fuckin’ sledgehammer on me. Pretty proud of it. [cheering] [whistling] [snorts, splutters] [two thudding slaps] [chokes] You almost broke the fuckin’ stage, dude. [laughter] [sighs] The truth is this. I’m just, uh… I’m happy to be doing stand-up again and actually standing. Because not long ago, I had a sports-related injury. I don’t know if you know this or not. Um… [crowd cheering] Well… If you don’t know, I will try to say this with a straight face. Uh… I, Tom, the guy you see standing up here, I was severely injured whilst participating in a slam-dunk contest. [scattered cheers and applaus',\n",
              "  'e] [loud cheering] Um… On a slightly-lowered rim. Now… It was wild. If you don’t know, I tore my patellar tendon… [exhales swiftly] …right there. Which, you know, whatever. [chuckles] [laughter] Happened to Klay Thompson, happened to me. It happens to us. But… [laughter] I’m not Klay Thompson, so I also broke this arm. And… It’s all captured on video that I find very not funny, but a lot of people enjoy it. [scattered applause] I have to tell people, “I didn’t laugh a lot that night.” And they’re like, “Really?” Yeah. There is one exchange that I do like to share, and it is this. Immediately after I was hurt, I was in the emergency room. And I was badly hurt. I had a shattered arm, a leg that didn’t function. And they were prepping me for the operating room. And at that time, a trauma surgeon came into that room and he looked at my x-rays and he goes, “Car accident?” [laughter] And I got to lay there and go… [quietly] “Dunk contest.” [laughter] [cheers and applause] And he goes, “What was that? What did you just say?” And I go, “Slam motherfuckin’ dunk contest.” [laughter] He goes, “Did a car hit you while you were dunking?” [laughter] I said, “Why don’t you do your fuckin’ job, all right?” Some people don’t know this, I was in the hospital for three weeks. That’s a long time. I don’t think I would’ve made it through if it weren’t for my dear, dear friend, Dilaudid. Um… [laughter] [scattered cheers] Yeah. I did not realize that I have been fucking around with weed all these years… [scattered cheering] …when narcotics is where it’s at. All right? [cheering] [scattered applause] That shit is electric. And… if anybody ever offers you an oxy, say, “Hit me two times.” Because… they’re amazing and nothing bad’ll happen to you. [laughter] Nah, your life will fall apart, but it’ll feel good while it’s happening. The only downside really is that you’ll never shit… again. Uh… [laughter] I took my first shit eight days after I started eating those. I was scared. I called in the doctor. I was like, “I have an arm that doesn’t work, a leg that doesn’t work.” “How do I lean? How do I wipe myself?” He goes, “Don’t worry about it.” “One of the nurses will do it.” And I was like, “Okay.” [laughter] And then a fuckin’ male nurse came i',\n",
              "  'n the room. [laughter] They’re allowed to have the job too. And… [crowd chuckling] This dude stood at the door and threw a pack of wipes. [laughter] I go, “What’s that?” He said, “The doctor said you need to clean yourself.” And I went… [chuckles devilishly] [uproarious laughter] “You’re gonna do it.” And I saw a grown professional nurse just go, “Ah, fuck.” Like… [laughter] He quit. I saw him quit his job. Isn’t that crazy? Now… Five days later, I had my second movement, and they sent in an old-lady nurse, which is fine. But she talked the whole time. Do you know how terrible…? You’re vulnerable. Like… [whimpers] She’s back there, like, “How we gonna clean up all this stool?” I’m like, “I don’t know. Shut up.” [laughter] And she goes, “My, my, my.” “You have so much hair back here.” And I’m like… “Yeah, I do it for my dad.” You know, like… [laughter] [cheers and applause] What? I mean… I like to picture him up in heaven, looking down. “Look at that hair on my son. Isn’t that nice?” God’s with him. “That is nice.” [laughter] I picture my dad naked. You know? [laughs] I… [laughter] I picture everybody in heaven nak… I don’t think you’re in heaven, “What shirt should I wear today?” I think people are naked. I think God’s naked. I think after a while it makes sense that my father would notice that God has a fuckin’ piece on him. You know? It’s God. I think it’s enormous. And glorious. I think it’s blue. And I think… [laughter] …it has a golden hue around it. I think after a while, my dad would go, “Can I touch that?” [laughter] And God’s like, “Of course.” “You are one of my children.” [chuckles] [laughter] [laughter swells] Then he goes, “Thanks. That was neat.” [laughter] And then God says, “Do you want to see it snow?” [imitates sexual moaning] [laughter] That’s what snow is. You didn’t know that? Snowing. Good. I hope I ruined snow for you. Now… [laughter] It took me six months of pretty intense rehab, PT and OT. Shout-out to all the PTs and OTs in the world working with people. Fantastic. [applause] Well, they worked with me so that I could move around again normally and naturally. And then this always gets me, you guys. Seven months to the day, to the day, after I was injured, I was at home. I was asleep. It was tw',\n",
              "  'o o’clock in the morning. And I heard my wife scream, but, like, a real scream. You know, like… [muted panicked screaming] So I took a pillow, I turned, and I covered this ear. Right? [laughter] “I am trying to sleep.” And then she starts calling me out by name. She’s like, “Tom?” “Tom?” And I go, “Goddammit.” [laughter] “This sounds real.” So I got up, I made myself something to eat. [laughter] Poured a drink. And I was like, “All right.” “Let’s go find her.” [laughter] Now, it’s 2:00 a.m. I… I can’t see anything. I’m just following her cries for help. And I finally find her sitting at the bottom of the stairs. And I go, “What are you doing?” She goes, “I think I sprained my ankle.” [laughter] I turn the light on, and I see that the bone that should be like this… [clicks tongue] …is like that. [audience groans] And I go, “That… [laughingly] …is not a sprain.” [laughter] “I’m sure of it.” [laughter] And she goes, “What should I do?” I said, “You should do nothing.” “I will call 911.” [laughter] I have to confess I was very, very excited to call 911. [laughter] Have you ever been excited to call? Like, “Finally, a good one.” You know? Like… “This is why we play the game.” I call. The operator goes, “911.” And I’m so amped up, I go, “Get fuckin’ ready.” [laughter] [scattered applause] He’s like, “Okay.” [laughter continues] He goes, “You need police, fire, or paramedic?” I go, “Paramedic!” “But send ’em all!” And he was like, “What happened?” And I was like, “Ooh.” [laughter] And I realize that while what I’m about to say is true, it sounds… [high-pitched] …suspicious. [laughter] But I gotta say it. So I’m like, “My wife fell down the stairs.” [loud laughter] [cheers and applause] [cheers fading] The operator goes, “Uh-huh.” [laughter] He goes, “How’d that happen?” I was like, “I don’t fuckin’ know.” [laughter] He goes, “Was she alone?” I’m like, “Do I need to talk to a lawyer?” [laughter] Four paramedics show up. I open the door. They go, “What happened?” I go, “You know the deal.” [laughter] “My wife fell down the stairs.” And they go, “How’d it happen?” I go, “I do not know.” They’re like, “Was she alone?” I go, “Talk to my lawyer. He’s on the phone right now.” [crowd chuckling] Then they start tending to her. Like, ',\n",
              "  'they put her leg in a brace. You know? Start giving her an IV. I lean over to her and I have a private conversation as you sometimes do. I go, “Hey, I wanna tell you something.” “I don’t like the way I’m being spoken to here.” [laughter] “I feel like everybody’s implying I had something to do with this.” “And I don’t like it.” And then I walked away. And a few moments later, she decided to make an announcement. [crowd chuckles] Unprompted. She goes, “Guys?” And they all turn. And she goes, “He would never hurt me.” And I’m like… [uproarious laughter] [scattered applause] “What are you doing?” [scattered cheers] She goes, “We’ve been together a long time.” “And if you think he did this, he didn’t.” I go, “Shut the fuck up.” [laughter] “Or I will kill you.” [laughter] [scattered applause] Then we get to the hospital. Doctor’s like, “What happened?” I go, “I punched her in the mouth and she fell down the stairs.” [laughter] And he goes, “I get it, man. I get it.” [laughter] “She’s super chatty.” I go, “I know.” [laughter continues] “You should see her at home.” No, she’s doing better now. She learned. She gets it, you know. [laughter] [scattered applause] “Sandwich at 6:00.” All right. So… [laughs softly] [crowd chuckling] She came to a show and saw me tell that story, and she was like, “Can you imagine if you had hit me?” And I was like, “Uh… yeah.” [laughter] Don’t feel bad for her, okay? I’m serious. I just did her a huge solid. She asked me to do this and I did it. She asked me to get a vasectomy and I did it. So I got snipped. Yeah. [women cheering] See? The women always cheer and there’s always one guy that boos. [laughter] Like he wanted my full load all up inside of him. [laughter] Listen, if you’re a guy and you’re thinking about doing it, do it. It’s a routine procedure. You will be nervous the morning of. It’s your balls. [crowd chuckling] You lay on a table. It’s very cold. It’s, like, 400 below zero. And… [laughter] They pull up your dress very dramatically. They’re like, “What’s going on down here?” [laughter] Your dick just stares at you, like, “How could you?” You know? [laughter] But it’s over in 15 minutes, which I think is remarkable. And then you go back a week later for the follow-up. And the follow-',\n",

[laughter] [audience murmuring, chuckling] He says, “I’m gonna give you your homework.” Those are his words. “I’m gonna give you your homework.” I go, “What’s my homework?” He goes, “Go home, ejaculate 20 times.” “Bring in your 21st sample in this cup, and we’ll test it and let you know if you’re clear.” I was like, “That ain’t shit.” You know? [laughter] [scattered applause] I do my homework all the time, baby. So… [laughter] [cheering] He goes to leave, but he stops at the door. He goes, “Oh! I almost forgot to tell you.” “Take your time.” And I said, “I was gonna.” [laughter] And then he says, “Sometimes I forget to tell people.” Which tells me that some people have returned rather quickly. [laughter] With their assignment. So I immediately ask him. I go, “What’s the fastest anyone’s done 20 ejaculations?” [laughter] He goes, “48 hours.” And I was like… [audience groans] “That motherfucker can keep that record. I don’t want anything to do with that.” [laughter] “That’s the champ champ right there.” [laughter] I went home and took another week off. I was black and blue. I was sore. Like, “All right.” But after the week, it’s time to get going. I started slowly, you know. I was like… [laughter] “Wake up.” Didn’t feel the same. It was strange. Different. You know? I could feel the system turning on. You know what it reminded me of? You know when you run the heat for the first time in the winter? And you’re like, “This smells weird, man.” Like… [laughter] I could feel it building up. And I could not get this one intrusive thought out of my head, which was, “It’s just gonna be blood that comes out.” [audience groans] I didn’t want it to be. [laughter] I just kept thinking it. So now I’m jerking off all scared. Like… [exaggerated whimpering] [sorrowfully] “It’s gonna be blood!” [laughter] But I pushed through. I kept going. And… [laughter] …when it finally did go, it wasn’t blood. And in relief, I laughed. [crowd chuckles] So my first jack back was me going… [laughs maniacally] [laughter] [applause] Yeah.

Now… The only thing, uh, that could deal with that specific type of pain when I had the vasectomy was eating edibles. You know? I had to eat edibles every day for that achy, weird pain. Yeah. I always feel like I have to confess to people immediately when I tell them, like, that I like edibles, and that is because I am a lightweight and I like mild edibles. Some people wanna eat edibles… [applause] You know, yeah. And… Some people wanna peek into the third dimension casually every day. [cheering] That’s not me. All right? I like five and ten milligrams, and people… [cheering] Sure. [applause] People mock me and they call me “10 Milligram Tom” and this bullshit. [laughter] Yell it to me on the street. Like, “Are you eating your baby edibles?” And I go, “Yes. Because I like to be able to speak.” “Is that crazy to you?” [scattered cheers] “You don’t know people that like a couple beers?” Is it always, “I like to drink 36.” “Okay. Good for you, Bert.” “Have a great night.” So… [raucous cheering] [cheering fades] [guffaws mockingly] [laughter] [scattered cheers and applause] [mockingly] “I’m the mechanic!” Or whatever.

[laughter] Speaking of friends, you never… I wanna make this clear. If you drink, if you smoke, if you inject things into your eyeballs, you never have to worry about strangers. Never push the myth that a stranger might be culpable in getting you fucked up. People say it, like, “What if a stranger spikes my drink?” “What if a stranger hands me a joint and it’s laced?” Guess what? It’ll never be a stranger. It’ll be one of your friends. Okay? [laughter] Your friends will fuck you the hardest. [laughter] I know this firsthand. I have a bunch of really cool friends.

Now… [resounding cheers] [audience member whistles] [cheers fade] If you’re here and don’t know who that is, please allow me to describe him to you. [laughter] Joey is a very funny man. He’s a… He’s a comedian. He’s 60 years old. He’s a Cuban immigrant. Uh, he weighs 295. And… he sort of looks like if somebody was making a person and then they left him under a heat lamp for like 15 minutes. [crowd groans, chuckling] As a side note, I feel like I should point out he was addicted to cocaine and heroin for 20 years. I think that’s relevant to the story. Now… [crowd chuckling] Joey’s very affectionate. I get to this place and he gives me a great big hug. And the first thing he says to me, he goes, “I got you something.” [crowd chuckles] I go, “You got me something? What did you get me?” He goes, “I know you like your tens. You’re 10 Milli Tom.” [laughter] “I got you some tens.” And I go, “No, you didn’t.” [laughter] He goes, “I did.” I go, “No, you didn’t.” He goes, “Why are you saying that?” “‘Cause you’re a liar and a bad person.” “You’re lying right now.” [laughter] He goes, “No, I’m not.” I go, “Sure you are.” And he has a jar, and he pours five gelcaps into his hand. And he goes, “These are tens.” And I go, “Bullshit.” [laughter] And then he goes… [gulps] [laughter] Eats all five. Like they’re Skittles. [laughter] So then I go, “Huh. Maybe they are tens.” [laughter] [scattered applause] I said, “I would like one.” I put it on my tongue. I take a sip of water. As it goes down, I look at him. He goes, “Oh!” [laughter] I go, “How much did I just take?” And he goes, “Ten.” And he just walks out of the room. [laughter] I’m watching him perform. You know, 30 minutes in, I have a buzz. When the show’s over, I am out… of my goddamn mind. [laughter] I am vibrating like a tuning fork. I’m like… [imitates pulsing vibration] [laughter] I can’t open my eyes. I’m like… [laughter] I have to put my hand on a man’s shoulder to guide me across the room. I’m like… [laughter] I go… [clenched] “Joey, we gotta get the fuck outta here.” And we do. Do you know where we go? To the airport. Yay. [laughter] Let’s have a panic attack',\n",
              "  ' in a tube in the sky. I’m walking through Miami International Airport freaking people the fuck out. All right? You know why? I forget how to walk. I forget how to walk. I can’t figure out the fuckin’ body scanner thing. I’m like… [snickers] [laughter] [nervously] “Can you hear my heartbeat too?” [titters] [laughter] [scattered applause] I’m sweating, but I’m cold. You know? Asking everyone for blankets, like, “Do you have a blanket?” “I want a blanket!” They’re like, “You’re on the toilet. Get the fuck outta here.” [laughter] I pass out in a meditative state. On this flight. I do. Then I just wake up scared. You ever wake up just terrified? Like, I sit up and I’m like, “Ah!” [laughter] “Why am I a bad person?” [laughter] And I do something I’ve never done. A flight attendant passes down the aisle, and as she passes, I grab her arm. Hard. Like I’m gonna put it on my dick. Like, I grab it. [laughter] And she’s stunned. So she goes… [exclaims] [laughter] And I’m so fucked up, I go, “Wait, how come? Do you know?” [raucous laughter] “Why are we alive?” And she’s like, “What? What?” Now luckily I have a decent friend with me, Shaun. He interjects, goes, “He took an Ambien.” She’s like, “Okay.” She just keeps going down the aisle. [laughter] Now he’s worried about me, so he wakes Joey up. He goes, “Joey!” And Joey’s like, “What?” He goes, “What did you give Tom?” He goes, “I gave him 200 milligrams.” [audience exclaims, laughs] “Dipped in hash oil.” [audience exclaiming] I go… [slurred] “Why you do that to me?” [laughter] He goes, “You’re gonna see the devil now, bitch.” [laughter] [resounding cheers and applause] [audience member whistles] [applause fades] I go, “I think I’m fuckin’ looking at him.” [laughter] And let’s rewind, by the way. He took five. He’s on a thousand milligrams. Like… [yawns] “What are you doing tomorrow?” “I’m going to the hospital tomorrow. What are you doing?” Psycho. [crowd chuckling] But listen to me. If you have never been surprise megadosed, it is horrific. [laughter] It is a harrowing, panic-induced terror ride. And so a few weeks ago, I did it to my mother. Uh… [laughter] [scattered cheers, applause] I did. I was visiting her. She’s alone. She knows I eat them at night. I’ve told her they hel',\n",
              "  'p me sleep, which they do. And she calls them “gummies.” So… She comes up to me and she’s like… [slightly accented] “Are you going to have a gummy tonight?” And I go, “Yes.” She goes, “May I have one?” And I was like… [laughs] “Yeah.” [laughter] I give her one because I take one. And one gets me high, so I’m like, “This is gonna peel back her wig.” You know? [laughter] I sit around with her for a couple hours. Then I ask her, “How do you feel?” She goes… [with emphasis] “I feel nothing.” [laughter] Like, “Really?” She goes, “Yes.” I go, “All right. I don’t know. Go to bed, you fuckin’ savage.” “I don’t know what to tell you.” [laughter] The next day, it’s evening and she comes up to me again. [mimics accent] “May I have another gummy tonight?” I go, “You had one yesterday. You didn’t feel anything.” She goes, “Maybe I should take two.” [laughter] [clicks tongue] “Maybe you should.” [laughter] I give her two. We hang out. And again, I ask her, “How do you feel?” She goes… [with emphasis] “I feel nothing.” I’m like, “Really?” She goes, “Should I take two more?” I said, “Hey, Pablo, you might wanna keep it in first for a minute.” [laughter] She goes, “You don’t think so?” I go, “Actually, I do think so. Here. Here’s two more.” I give it to her. She eats them. And then she says, “I’m going to bed.” I go, “All right.” She goes to her room. I go to the guest room. A few minutes later… [crowd chuckles] …I receive a series of text messages that I have since memorized. [laughter] The first one says, “Tommy, I am fizzing.” [laughter] F-I-Z-Z… I-N-G. I write back, “Sounds cool.” [laughter] ‘Cause who the fuck is like, “I’m fizzing right now”? [laughter] [scattered applause, cheers] “We out here fizzing tonight, baby.” I don’t know what that is. She writes back, “My heart rate is 125.” [crowd chuckles] “Oh, I am spinning.” So I write, “LOL.” I think she’s having fun. [laughter] Then she writes, “Please come now. I don’t feel well.” I go into her room and my mother is seated upright. [laughter] In b… That is an alarming look. For an elderly woman? Most of them lay down or lean. She’s just in bed, like… [laughter] I go, “Are you okay?” She goes… [hoarsely] “No.” [laughter] So I take her out to the patio. I’m thinking, “Fresh air.” ',\n",
              "  'You know? It’s clear immediately that we are in for a ride. [laughter] The first thing she does, she goes… [smacks lips rapidly] [laughter] [mimics accent] “My lips!” “They are stuck together.” [laughter] [scattered applause] I go, “I’ll get you some water.” [crowd chuckling] And she goes, “Why am I hungry?” [laughter] I said, “‘Cause it’s working.” [laughter] And she goes, “The dog was here. The dog is gone?” And I go, “Oh my God.” [laughter] I start to laugh so… destructively hard. [laughter] It… It is not, “Ha-ha-ha.” It is a deep, primal… I’m watching my 77-year-old mother get high. I’m not laughing, my nervous system is shutting down, all right? [laughter] I mean, I’m watching her look at sounds. You know, she’s like… [laughter] It hurts. It hurts how hard… My esoph… I’m like… [raspy exhaling] As I’m laughing, I look at her. And at one moment, her face contorts. Her face goes… [laughter] And she looks at me. And she goes, “Tomorrow, your laughter will be tears on my corpse.” And I’m like… [audience exclaims] “What?!” She goes, “It’s the perfect murder.” [laughter] “Nobody will know it was you.” My lungs invert at this point. And I have tears streaming down my face. She’s so high, she thinks my laughter is confirming her thoughts. [laughter] She starts to legit plead for her life. [laughter continues] She goes, “Tommy, please!” “Please!” “Don’t kill me!” [laughter] “I am your mother!” [laughter continues] I fuckin’ pass out in a chair. I’m like… [grunts] [laughter] [applause] [resounding cheers] [applause fades] I wake. I don’t even know where the fuck I am. It’s morning. I walk into the kitchen at the same time as her. I go, “Hey, Mom.” And she doesn’t say anything. I’m like, “Oh, shit.” She just walks over to the coffee maker and she goes… [sucks teeth] “I know you tried to kill me last night.” [clamorous laughter] “It was very clever.” [laughter continues] “But I am still here, Tommy.” [laughter] I go, “I didn’t try to kill you.” She goes, “Oh yes, you did.” So I leave for the day. I come back later. I go, “Look, I owe you an apology.” “I should not have let you eat that much. I’m sorry.” She goes, “It’s okay. I forgive you.” I’m like, “Really? Thank you. Makes me feel better.” She goes, “I want to tell you one',\n",

              " ['[lively music playing] [announcer] Detroit, give it up… for Trevor Noah! [audience cheering] What’s going on, Detroit? Oh! How you doing tonight, everybody? How you doing? Welcome to the show. Thank you so much for coming out. Look at this. What a night. What a feeling. Here we are. Detroit, Michigan. We made it. [audience cheering and applauding] I’ve really been enjoying it. I’m enjoying everywhere, honestly. I’m having more fun in my life now than I think I’ve ever had. I’m enjoying America more now than I’ve ever, ever enjoyed it. Every day. I don’t even know what it is. I think it’s… You enjoy a place differently when it might be ending, you know? It just has a… It has a different feeling to it, like… “Mmm, what is that taste?” “The final season? Mmm-mmm-mmm” ‘Cause you never know with America. You really never know. Every day is the best day, and possibly the last day. I’m having an amazing time, I truly am. This year was such a blessing, because… I got to travel around the world, doing shows in places I had never performed before. Places I’ve always wanted to do comedy, I’ve always wanted to try it out. I did shows in Berlin, Germany, for the first time ever. That was really amazing. I won’t lie, people freaked me out before I went there. Similar to Detroit, where people are like, “Oh, watch out, Detroit.” People were like that with Germany as well. Like, when I was going to Berlin, people were like, “Dude, Germany?” “Do they even laugh?” I’m like, “What do you mean? They’re human beings.” “I don’t know, man. Do they laugh?” People got to me. At a point when I was heading to Germany, I was like, maybe Germans just sit in the audience, like, [in German accent] “Uh-huh. Ja, ja, uh-huh.” “That was a comedy show.” [normally] But they don’t. They laugh. They’re actually great audiences. I had an amazing time in Berlin. It’s a city that sneaks up on you, because it’s… It’s so culturally diverse. You know? It has a burgeoning art scene. Fantastic music. The history… The history in Berlin is truly deep and rich. I love traveling and seeing places whenever I’m in certain cities and in Berlin, I went out with a tour group and I had a great time. But I wish someone had warned me how painful a lot of Berlin’s history is. ‘Cause that was basically the headquarters of the Nazi Party. So everything ties back to Hitler. I didn’t know this. I thought we’re going on a cute little tour. I ask a lot of questions. I’m curious. This brought the mood down. We’re out and about. The tour guide was doing his schtick. He was happy as well. [in German accent] “Here, behind me, you can see, this is one of the largest airports that was ever built in the world',\n",
              "  '.” “Ja, it is a world famous airport here in Berlin, and it is so large that we were able…” “They filmed the Hollywood movie The Hunger Games inside this airport.” “Ja, any questions?” [normally] I said, “Yeah. Wow. How old is this thing?” [in German accent] “This is almost 100 years old.” [normally] And I’m like, “Damn! Who built it?” [in German accent] “Yeah. That is the unfortunate part of the… of the story here.” “This airport was built by, uh, Hitler.” [in normal voice] I could see I’d messed things up. I tried to bring the mood up. I was like, “Which Hitler?” He says, [in German accent] “Which Hitler?” “Which other Hitler is there?” I was like, “Could be Henry Hitler.” “Henry Hitler?” “Who the hell is Henry Hitler?” I was like, “You don’t know Henry Hitler?” It didn’t work. Like, “Yo, man.” It was tense, but it was good. And what I mean by good… It was nice to be in a place where people don’t bury their history. What I mean by that… [audience applauding] What I mean by that is that when you travel through Germany, even if you don’t go to museums, you cannot escape the past of both Berlin and what Germany did. There are monuments scattered throughout the city. Prominent monuments. They are memorializing what Germany did to millions of Jewish people and other people around the world. You see it, you understand it, they talk about it. They teach their kids about it. They teach children in school. They’re like, “Hey, this is what Germany did.” They make sure they know. But they don’t make them feel guilty about it. Which is an amazing balance for them to strike. They’ll say to the kids, they’re like, “Hey, kids. I hope you understand.” “Germany did this.” “You’re not responsible because you weren’t there.” “However, because you’re the future of Germany, it’s your responsibility to make sure this doesn’t happen again.” [audience cheering and applauding] You know, what I loved about being in Germany when they were talking about their history is how forthright they are about it. They know it’s painful. They know that it’s a terrible blight on who they are, but they don’t hide from it. When I saw them doing this, I went, “Man, I wish America did this with history.” You know? ‘Cause you… You ever see how awkward it is, speaking about history in America? It gets tense. Doesn’t matter what history it is. It gets tense. Columbus Day is one of those days. Every year in New York, there’s a fight. Here in Detroit, there was a fight. There was a bust of Christopher Columbus, was around for 110 years. At a point, half of Detroit was like, “We need to get rid of it.” The other half said, “Don’t get rid of it.” It was a huge fight. New York, same th',\n",
              "  'ing, every year. Columbus Day, Indigenous Peoples’ Day. Columbus Day, Indigenous Peoples’ Day. There was an interview on the news I saw once. [chuckles] It wasn’t supposed to be funny, but I found it funny. The reporter went to a guy and asked, “What will you be doing for Indigenous Peoples’ Day?” He was like, [Italian-American accent] “It’s Columbus Day, I’m sick and tired of people coming in and changing the name.” “We’re proud of that day.” “It’s Christopher Columbus. Columbus Day. It’s not gonna change.” “In fact, how would you feel if somebody came along, took something that’s been around for a long time, and just decided to switch it and call it something else?” “Huh? How would you feel?” [in normal voice] I was like, “But, sir, isn’t that the spirit of Columbus Day?” I’ll be honest. I’m not a big fan of Indigenous Peoples’ Day. The title, I don’t like… I think it’s a cop-out. I don’t think it’s specific enough. It’s lazy. “Indigenous Peoples’ Day.” Which Indigenous people? Where? How? Give me something. You know what I liked about Columbus Day? It’s that it was specific. Yeah. It was a specific, inspiring story of a man by the name Christopher Columbus who believed, against all odds, that he could sail the wrong way around the world and get to India from the other side. Nobody believed in him. Yeah. He said, “I’m gonna do this.” They said, “You can’t do it, Chris.” He was like, “I will.” They’re like, “You can’t do it!” He said, “I will!” They said, “You can’t!” And he raised money, he fought for years, he finally got the ships. And he sailed the wrong way around the world and he didn’t do it. Not only did he not land on the other side of India, he found himself in a place called the Caribbean. And he was like, “This is India.” And the people went, [in Caribbean accent] “I don’t know if you’ve been eating some of the herb we’ve been leaving about, but this is totally not India.” He was like, “This is India and you guys are Indians.” They’re like, “Brother, we are not Indians.” He’s like, “I know Indians when I don’t see them.” “You’re Indians, just on the far side.” “So you’re West Indians.” And he stuck with it. Christopher Columbus stuck with it his entire life. Other explorers would come to him like, “Yo, Chris.” “I don’t think you made it to India.” He’s like, “It’s India.” They’re like, “I don’t think it’s India.” He’s like, “It’s India.” He died refusing to acknowledge the possibility that he never made it to India. Not only that, my friends, he never set foot in America, ever. Ever. And yet, he had a public holiday named after him in America. That, my friends, is the inspiring story of how white men can fail up. Do you kno',\n",
              "  'w how much confidence you have to have to pull that off? Nobody else. That is white man confidence. Nobody else possesses that level of confidence. Go the wrong way. End up in the wrong place. Call the wrong people the wrong name and be like, “I’m right.” “Give me a holiday.” No one else can do that. That is the level of confidence we should all aspire to, is white man levels of confidence. Women couldn’t pull that off. If a woman said, “I’ll sail the wrong way around the Earth.” They’ll be like, “Burn her. She’s a witch!” You think people of color could pull that off? You think Black people could? Wow, really? Like he was gonna sail around the world the wrong way around. Get to the place they’re not supposed to be. Probably get arrested for trespassing. Like, “What are you doing here?” [in African-American accent] “My bad, I thought I was getting to India.” “Man, I don’t know what I was thinking.” “We should’ve never messed with ships. It never turns out good.” “I apologize. I apologize, man.” “This won’t happen again.” Why would you wanna bury your history? There’s so much joy and so much to learn. You know? It feels like America is moving in that direction. It wants less and less of its history, less and less context. You look what’s happening with textbooks. Places like Florida, they wanna ban textbooks or cut out the parts of the textbooks that have slavery in the books. And now parents are fighting. They’re like, “No, no, take the slavery out. It’s making the kids feel bad.” Other parents are like, “Keep the slavery in.” “It teaches children.” And they’re fighting back and forth. I’m like, “Why?” You don’t need to be fighting about… No one should be fighting about this. Kids don’t read textbooks. They watch TikTok. If you wanna get to the kids, that’s where you gotta be. ♪ There was slavery ♪\\n♪ Ships came ♪\\n♪ Yeah… ♪ I’ll be honest. I don’t think that textbook thing is like a real issue. I feel like it’s one of those manufactured issues that often happens in America that gets people riled up and gets them fired up, fighting about something that was never an issue to begin with. I say this because that’s honestly what I believe. I feel like in America, politicians have done a really good job of tricking Americans into fighting about issues that were never an issue to begin with, so that you don’t pay attention to the issues that actually are. You know? If you’re fighting about what’s in a textbook, you don’t pay attention to the fact that inflation is out of control. You don’t pay attention that rents are out of control. People cannot afford to live anywhere. Salaries have never kept up with inflation. Corporations steal billions a',\n",
              "  'nd billions of dollars from their employees with no ramifications. You don’t pay attention to any of that. You pay attention to what’s catchy, what’s easy to keep up with. It keeps you going, you know? “Ooh, can trans people use public bathrooms?” “Ooh!” It’s manufactured. Who was dealing with this issue? Honestly. Who was actually dealing with this issue? You know what they did? Some politician figured out, they go, “Here’s a small story affecting a few people in a random place.” “I’ll make it seem like a nationwide issue, then everyone starts fighting.” But who was dealing with it? Who has ever been in a situation where you were in a bathroom, and all of a sudden a skirmish broke out and people go, “Excuse me, is this the gender that you were born with?” “Does it coincide with the sign on the door?” “Is your genitalia matching this?” “Can I see it?” Who’s ever seen that? Nobody. Nobody. But they make us fight about it because it’s catchy. “Who can use which bathroom.” Who cares? Who cares? I mean it, who cares? I know some would be like, “Trans people care.” They wanna know if they can use a public bathroom. Yeah, use whichever bathroom you want. Who’s gonna stop you? No, seriously, it’s a public toilet. Who is going to stop you? You tell me who’s gonna enforce that law? We can’t even enforce the idea that people should shit into the toilet. But you think magically they’re gonna figure out if you were born this way. Use whichever one you want. Why are we wasting our time? Other people are like, “We’ll fight because you gotta know who’s…” Let me tell you something. If you are spending enough time to know the genitalia of the other people in a public bathroom, you’re the creep. I’m worried about you. There is a simple rule to every public toilet around the world. And that rule is, you get in, pay no attention to anyone else, hold your breath and you get out. Quit standing around staring at other people. Every man in this room knows when we use the toilet, we get in, public toilet, you stare dead ahead, you pee, do your thing. Do not look to either side. If you’re fidgety, look up, look down. You do not look at anyone else. The guy next to you can start choking. You don’t turn your head. You don’t shake, you don’t move. You hear him, like… [mimics choking] You be like, “Hey, man, hey. Hey.” “Hey, you all right? Yo, yo.” “Hey, man, you okay?” “Yo, yo. You want me to call… Hey, man, are you okay?” [mimics choking] “You wanna call… “”Don’t look at me!” What are we doing? What are we fighting about? Public bathrooms. If you know your history, you know this happens all the time in America. It happens over and over and over again. There was a ',\n",
              "  'time when women had to fight to use public bathrooms in America. Imagine that. There was literally a time when women weren’t allowed to use public bathrooms all across America and they had to fight. And there were men who were angry. They were like, “This is crazy.” “You’re gonna have women in public bathrooms? That’s insane!” “How does it work, huh?” “What, they’re gonna come in there while we’re peeing?” “And then what? They’re gonna look at our wieners?” “And they’re gonna laugh, huh?” Think about this, ladies. There was a time when women were first allowed to step into the workplace, where there were no public bathrooms they could use. So, ladies, if you were out and about back then, you needed to pee, you needed to poo, you had to go home. Yeah. And I say poo theoretically, I don’t know if you actually do. No, I don’t think any guy does. Let’s be honest. We don’t. We assume this on a biological level, but I don’t know for certain that any woman actually… In fact, any man in here, think of any woman in your life. Do you know the last time she pooed? I don’t think you know. I don’t think you know. There is no forensic evidence to back up that claim. There is no smell. There is no stain. There is no nothing. Ladies, I don’t know who does your bathroom PR, but they are doing a stellar job. Stellar job. Women go to the bathroom, smells better when they come out of it. How? You never know when a lady is pooing. Never. Because also, women keep the same amount of time. That’s the most impressive thing. You give nothing away. Yeah, a woman’s gonna go pee, it takes ten minutes. She goes to the bathroom. All right. Gets there, tinkle, tinkle, tinkle, comes out, washes her hand, powders her face, texts on the phone, comes back to the table. You have no clue. Yeah. She’s gonna go poo, same thing, ten minutes. Goes to the bathroom, pellets, pellets, pellets, comes back out. Wash her hands, powder the nose, text her friends. Get back out there. You have no clue. With men, you know exactly what we’re doing. Discretion is not our forte. You know when every single man is gonna go pee. Why? Two minutes. Off to the bathroom, we’re in there. Quickest thing ever. It’s like a NASCAR pit stop. Yeah, we get in, we pee, we come back out, act like we’re washing our hands and we’re back. How do you know when we take a dump? ‘Cause it’s obvious. We go to the bathroom, never come back. That’s the last time you’ll ever see us. Your family’s putting up wanted posters in the restaurant. “Have you seen this man?” Imagine, people were fighting about bathrooms every time in America. Every time. There was a time when Black people had to fight to use public bathrooms. ',\n",
              "  'Huh. Same thing. Black people were like, “Why can we not use public bathrooms?” And again, people were angry. “This is crazy.” “You’re gonna have Black people in this in a public bathroom?” “How does that even work, huh?” “So what? They’re gonna be standing there while I pee, huh?” “They’re gonna be looking at my wiener? Huh?” “And they’re gonna laugh? Huh?” I’m old enough to remember when there was a discussion in America about whether gay people could use public bathrooms. This was an actual topic of discussion. I remember people on the news being interviewed. “Do you think gay men should be allowed into the same bathrooms as straight men?” They’ll be like, “I don’t mind what they do, if they keep it to themselves, that’s fine.” “But just answer me this. Answer me this. How is it gonna work?” “So what? You’re in the bathroom with them and then what?” “He’s gay and I’m just standing there and I’m peeing, huh?” “And he’s looking at my wiener? Huh?” “And then he grabs it, huh?” “And he starts yanking on it, huh?” “He just starts tugging away and I get hard and I’m enjoying it, huh?” “And then this is one of the best experiences I’ve ever had, huh?” “And then I start coming back weekly hoping I’ll bump into him and I do, huh?” “And then at some point we agree to meet outside, a nice little restaurant that’s cozy and get to know each other, huh?” “And then a few years later, we get married and our families are joined and we live happily ever after?” “Is that what you want?” Wow. Public bathrooms. It’s why you shouldn’t bury your history. If you know what’s happened, you know what to predict. You understand why it happened in the first place. Germany does that in a truly astounding way. It will never be perfect. But Germany is one of the only countries in the world that has actively paid reparations for what they did. One of the only countries in the world that has actively apologized and one of the only countries in the world that’s set about changing how they see themselves and how the world sees them. After World War II, Germany changed a bunch of laws. They changed the iconography of the country. What you could hang, where you could hang it. They changed their national anthem. Yeah, imagine that, they changed the national anthem. They felt that the national anthem was a nationalist song that the Nazis used to inspire people to think the wrong things. They changed it. The original song was called “Deutschland, Deutschland über alles.” You’ve probably heard it in old movies or whatever. The song went like… [singing in German] And translated into English, it means… ♪ Germany, Germany over everything ♪\\n♪ Over everything in the world ♪ And c',\n",
              "  'learly they meant it. Yeah, where most anthems are theoretical, the Germans are precise. But after World War II, they were like, “We can’t have that same attitude.” And so they changed the anthem. And new lyrics. The new lyrics are… [singing in German] Which translated into English is… ♪ Unity and rights and freedom ♪\\n♪ For all the people who live in Germany ♪ Which… Which is adorable. It’s adorable. They may as well have made the song… ♪ Sorry, sorry We’re so, so sorry ♪\\n♪ Sorry, sorry, sorry for what we did ♪ I appreciate that they did it, but I wouldn’t have gone that far. I won’t lie. I wouldn’t have gone that far. I think über alles is terrible. That’s not a good way to think. But you still gotta have a bit of kick in your anthem. You still gotta have a… I would’ve found a middle ground. Mine would have been… [in German] ♪ Germany Germany, somewhere… ♪ [in English]…in the top five. [in German] ♪ Not over everything in the world ♪ [in English] ♪ Because we are definitely In the top five ♪ ♪ When you think about it ♪ ♪ America’s number one ♪ ♪ And then you have Great Britain And then you have France and Spain ♪ ♪ And then we are at number five… ♪ Actually, Spain is not better than us. ♪ So we are number four ♪ ♪ Number four in the… ♪ Yeah, but France, their economy is not that strong. ♪ So, maybe we are number three In the world ♪ ♪ Then you have England above… ♪ Oh, wait, oh, Brexit was not a smart idea. ♪ So maybe if we are number two And America is number… ♪ Oh, the elections are not that stable. So… Then maybe we are über alles of the world! [chuckles] [in normal accent] It’s one of the biggest things they did, and nobody knows that they did it. I was chatting to a German guy. And he was perplexed by this. Absolutely perplexed. He said… [in German accent] “In Germany we’ve done so many things.” “The national anthem was a big change for us.” “I’m sure the whole world talks about this.” [in normal accent] I said, “Nope.” [sighs] He was like, “What do you mean?” “What do you mean? Who doesn’t talk about it?” I was like, “Nobody. Nobody talks about it.” “Who’s nobody?” I was like, “Nobody. No one.” “No one outside of Germany even knows this.” “How can they not know?” I was like, “What do you mean?” “It’s German. No one speaks German outside Germany.” “How would anyone know?” “Also, you guys did something weird.” “You changed the lyrics, but you kept the beat.” It’s a strange move. [in German accent] You’re like, “This song is terrible, and we’re changing it.” “Ja. What about the beat?” “No, we are keeping that ’cause I’ve learned all the moves. Ja.” [normally] That’s probably why most people don’t know it changed. You’ve kept the bea',\n",
              "  't. Most people don’t know the lyrics. We just know the beat. No one knew Michael Jackson was saying, “You’re a vegetable.” None of us knew that. Some of you are like, “When did he say ‘vegetable’?” Been singing it your whole life… ♪ You’re a vegetable ♪ No one knows lyrics. We just know the beat. That’s what Germany did. It’s weird. It’s weird to not change the music. ‘Cause the music comes with emotion. I was trying to explain this to him. He didn’t get it. And I realized, you know what it’s like. What Germany did, it would be like if in Star Wars, right? You know Star Wars. All right, let’s say, Darth Vader. Whenever Darth Vader came into a scene, whenever he landed on one of those planets, you always knew something was about to go down, something bad, because he had his music. All right? The music told you what was gonna happen. The ship would land… [imitates whooshing] Door would open… [imitates electric hum] And he’d be standing there. [imitates strained breathing] But he would never… He would never come into the game without his song playing. Never. He’ll be there, DJ on the side, like, [mimics Darth Vader] “DJ, play my jam.” [imitates record scratching] [mimics “The Imperial March”] “That’s right.” “Uh-huh.” And then you knew it was about to go down. Get down there… [mimics Darth Vader] “Kneel before me, Jedi.” [in high-pitched voice] “We’ll never kneel before you.” [mimics lightsabers whooshing] “You cannot defeat me.” “He’s so strong. I don’t know if we’re gonna win.” [mimics Yoda] “Defeat him, we shall.” [continues mimicking lightsabers] “Use the Force, we will.” [mimicking Darth Vader] “Ahh, you have defeated me!” “We did it, Master Yoda! We did it! “We defeated Darth Vader!” [mimics Yoda] “Indeed, we have.” “What do we do now?” “Free the Empire, we shall.” “Travel around, the good news we shall spread.” “Let’s do it.” “Yes, a new song we shall play.” [mimics “The Imperial March”] “You’re free.” [mimics “The Imperial March”] [in normal voice] It’s weird. It’s still impressive, though. Still impressive. Changing your national anthem is no small thing. It truly isn’t. Changing anything. We were having this conversation. And afterwards, he said something interesting, he’s like, [in German accent] “Because we saw how Germany had to change how it saw itself in order to change what it did, it’s why we changed the anthem.” I was like, “That’s powerful.” He’s like, “Do you think America would ever change…” I was like, “Don’t even finish that sentence.” “You don’t even finish that sentence.” If there’s one thing I’ve learned, America hates change. Whoo! America does not like change. You wanna change the things Germany changed? The mon',\n",
              "  'ey, the flags, the anthem. Are you kidding me? Remember when they tried to change the $20 bill? Remember that? They said they’d put Harriet Tubman on the bill. People got so angry, they postponed it indefinitely. People were furious. “What are you doing?” “We’re putting Harriet…” “How dare you?” “How dare you take an American president off the $20?” “How dare you take…” “Who’s on the $20?” “How dare you take Andrew Jackson off the $20 bill?” “They’re just putting Harriet Tubman on the front, and Andrew Jackson will be on the back.” “You’re putting an American president on the back? On the back?” “That’s disrespectful!” It’s not, really. If you know your history, you would know, Andrew Jackson would love to be on the back side of a Black woman, so I don’t know why you’re so stressed. I feel like everybody wins. People were furious, though. And now you’re gonna suggest changing the flag? Suggest changing the anthem? Whoo! There’s two things I’ve learned, living in America. It’s you respect the flag and you respect the anthem. I don’t know what it means. But I follow the rules. I say I don’t know what it means is because it’s confusing. You’ll meet people like, “You respect the flag!” and I get it. But then I’ll see those same people on July 4th, and they’ll be wearing the flag as underwear. Does that count? And you looked up and you were like, “That flag, these balls.” I would never suggest changing any of it. The anthem? Oh, no, never the anthem. Even though it could. Maybe it could do with a little change. It is a very violent anthem. And America struggles with violence, Maybe like a softer… It’s a violent anthem. It’s the only anthem I’ve ever heard that has bombs blowing up in it. Yeah. There are bombs and rockets in your national anthem. It’s like a Michael Bay movie in a song. Everything blowing up in slow motion. [imitates explosions] It’s almost like you’re threatening other countries as well. It’s like, “Yeah, bombs bursting and rockets were flaring.” “Try us.” It’s like a gangster rap, to be honest. It really is. The American anthem is like a gangster rap. It has all the same elements. It has the violence, it has the threats. You know how it’s similar to a gangster rap? The American anthem is the only anthem where you can put the word “bitch” at the end of any line and the song still makes sense. ♪ Gave proof through the night ♪\\n♪ That our flag was still there ♪\\n♪ Bitch ♪ I love the American national anthem, I won’t lie. It’s exciting, and I know all the words. I didn’t try, but I know them. It’s one of those songs that you hear so much that you know it. Sort of like ♪ Nationwide is on your side ♪ Same… Same thing. Don’t wanna k',\n",
              "  'now that. Don’t need to know that. Wish I could reclaim the space in my brain, but it’s there. America’s national anthem is like that, ’cause you hear it so much in America. Now, this is the only country I’ve ever ever lived in where you play the national anthem when there is no other country in attendance. It would be like basketball games, football games, beer pong games, national anthem. Which I know is normal if you’ve lived in America all your life. “What other way is there, Trevor?” I’ll tell you… I’ll tell you as somebody who comes from the rest of the world, that’s not a thing. It’s not. Most places in the world, you play the national anthem maybe once a year, on a national event, or when you’re competing against another country. Then you play it. ‘Cause the other country is there and you have to prove to your country that you’re loyal. That’s why you sing the song. ‘Cause countries are very insecure. You have to reassure them. Constantly reassuring. They should go to therapy, deal with their attachment issues, but they don’t. You only realize how insecure countries are when you leave your country. Have you ever left and come back? Have you seen the questions your country asks you? So insecure, so jealous. Just like, “Where have you been, huh?” “Where have you been? Which countries?” “So what? You have another country now?” “Is that what you’re doing, huh? Huh?” “Which stamps are these? Let’s see who’s been stamping your passport.” You’re like, “Damn, country. Let me get my privacy.” That’s why you only sing the anthem when there’s another country attending. The only time you do it. That’s what it’s for, to make your country feel good. All right? You know what national anthems are? National anthems are the geopolitical equivalent of that thing women do to us men. Like, ladies, you know that trick you have for that man in your life? Like, whenever his ego is bruised, and you have to you try and heal it. Every woman in this room has a trick that works on every man. And right now, I know a lot of the women are like, “Shut up, Trevor!” “Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!” It’s a beautiful, subtle technique. Yeah, you’ll be out having lunch or something, and some guy will come up to the table. He’s buff, works out, you know, looks really good. He’s like, “Oh, my God, Michelle? Michelle?” Like, “Oh, Justin? Oh, my God.” “Wow. How are you?” And you’re like, “Who the hell is Justin? What’s going on?” He’s like, “This is crazy. Twice in two weeks?” And you go like, “Twice? When was once? Who is this?” “I know. Oh, my God. How are you?” “I’m doing good. We gotta catch up. We gotta talk about college.” “I was thinking about it. We were so crazy in',\n",
              "  ' college.” “You remember that night?” “You went to college? What’s going on?” She can feel your ego slowly withering like a raisin in the sun. And she won’t look at you. She won’t make it a big thing. She’ll continue the conversation. But they’ll gently just put their hand on your thigh. And then just start rubbing it. She’ll carry on like nothing’s happening. “I know, those were crazy. I was a cheerleader. What are you gonna do?” “It’s just one of those.” And the hand is going, “Shh. Shh, shh, shh.” “Shh. It’s okay. It’s okay.” “It’s okay, you’re a big man. Big man.” “Strong man. That’s right.” “There’s no other man in the world. Just you. Look at you. Wow.” “What a big man. Yeah.” “Who, this guy? I don’t even know who he is.” “Yeah, no, with his muscles.” “Oh, I don’t like muscles, no.” “I hate muscles. They’re disgusting.” “Look at him, all working out and everything’s in shape and bulging.” “No, it’s disgusting.” “What, six-packs? No, I don’t want a six-pack.” “I don’t like six-packs. That’s why I like you.” Boop! That’s what a national anthem is. You reassuring your country. The American anthem is such an interesting one. You know? Everything that represents America is the anthem. America has the most fun anthem rules in the world. Only country in the world where you’re allowed to sing the anthem however you want. However you want. You can’t do that anywhere else. Everywhere else, the anthem is the way it is written. It’s boring, and that’s the point. You can’t just change it. In America, you can do whatever you please. I noticed it the first time. The first time I noticed it was at a basketball game. It was the New York Knicks against the Toronto Raptors, right? And because the Raptors are from Canada, they had to play two national anthems before the game, which is rare. And so we’re in the arena and then the voice comes on. “Ladies and gentlemen, please stand for the Canadian national anthem.” And everybody stood, and then they just played, like, a tape somewhere. [chuckles] You could tell they didn’t care. And it was the song, the Canadian song. It’s always the same. ♪ O Canada… ♪ [humming gibberish] ♪ And something, something Brings us back to… ♪ [singing “Do-Re-Mi”] ♪ Do-do-do-do… ♪ [chuckles] You know the song, man. I don’t have time for that. Whatever. They sang the Canadian anthem. They were done. The announcer came back, “And now, ladies and gentlemen, please stay standing for the American national anthem.” And that’s my favorite part. Yeah, the lights will go dark. Someone walks to the middle of the arena. It’s always so intense, complete silence. [slowly] ♪ O say ♪\\n♪ Can you ♪\\n♪ See ♪\\n♪ By the dawn’s early light ♪ [vocal',\n",

So, Germany was fun. And then we headed to Paris, France, to do shows for the first time in my life, I was very excited. I always wanted to perform in Paris. Didn’t know what it would be. But can I tell you? Paris is everything they tell you it is. It is easily one of the most romantic cities I have ever been to in my life. I fell in love 1,000 times. I was by myself. It didn’t matter. Yeah. Every night, it was just me and those bedbugs, baby. I really enjoyed Paris because I got to meet Parisians. In person. Not stereotypes, not things you’re told about. No, actually meet French people, learn about them from them. And I learned some truly amazing things. For instance, the French have a very different relationship with work than the rest of us, all right? In that they don’t give a shit about it. Which, honestly, I found inspiring. Yeah. I feel like a lot of us have become a little too attached to our work, you know? We identify with our work. Ever asked somebody like, “Tell me about yourself”? “I’m an architect…” “Tell me about yourself.” “I own a hair salon and…” “Tell me about yourself.” “I’m a teacher…” “Tell me about yourself,” and people will tell you about what they do. You know, it’s become the thing that people focus on. The French don’t do that. No. You’ll never meet a French person who does that. You go up to a French person and be like, “Excuse me. What do you do?” Be like, [in French accent] “Oh, me? I go for walks with my friends and, uh… I like to eat good food and…” [in normal voice] You’re like, “No, what do you do for a living?” “For a living? Pardon.” “Okay, for a living.” “Okay, no, I, uh, breathe and, uh…” “You know, I drink water and, uh, you know…” “Of course, I have to make love, you know.” [in normal voice] It’s just a different way to be, man. You know, not being so attached to your work. It was lovely. I learned this because when I flew to Paris, my luggage was lost. All right? Yeah. Landed in the airport, and bags were gone, didn’t arrive. I discovered this at the carousel, which is a shitty thing that airlines do to you. They know your bags are not coming. Yeah, they know where your bag is every single moment. But they don’t tell you. They’ll let you stand there like an idiot with ',\n",
              "  'hope in your heart. They could come to your seat before take-off and be like, “It’s not coming.” “Spoiler alert.” But they don’t. [chuckles] They let you take off with all that joy like an idiot. Whee! I landed in Paris. Thought it was the beginning of a great trip. I was skipping around. I had my full-luggage swag, “I’m going get my bags, go into Paris, start exploring.” Got to the carousel. I was like, “Mmm-mmm, full luggage swag.” “That’s right. Let me get my luggage, everybody.” I was like, “Excuse me.” “Make space, please.” “I would like to lean over the carousel.” “Makes the bags come quicker.” “Come on, lucky bag.” I had full luggage swag. Bags started coming out and I was standing there, judging them. “Ha-ha! Who still uses Samsonite?” [laughs] “Ah! Where’s my bag?” Bags going around, going around, and then new bags stopped coming out. I started worrying. Then there were fewer and fewer bags. And I was like, “Oh, my bag…” “My bag’s not coming.” And I realized my bag hadn’t arrived. It was terrible. I had the same feeling, the same feeling I had as a child when my mom would forget me at school. Exactly the same. Standing at the carousel, felt like I was ten years old again, like… [exaggeratedly imitates a child crying] [sobbing] “No, Mr. Wilkinson, it’s fine, you can go.” “My mom’s going to come. Don’t worry, you can go home.” “She’s coming. She wouldn’t forget me.” “No… She’s…” “She’s probably dead somewhere right now.” “She’s probably in a ditch lying dead.” [in normal voice] She forgot me. She’d forget me occasionally. And then I’d have to walk home. It was like an hour walk. [laughs] And I’d get home, and she’d always have the same reaction when I walked in, ’cause she worked from home. She’d have a little computer where she’d be typing away, and I’d walk into the house and I’ll close the door like… Always the same reaction, she’ll be like… [gasps] “No, no, no, no, no, baby, no! No, no, no, no! Oh!” “What time is it?” And I’ll be like, “It’s too late.” I’m not going to lie. I hated being forgotten at school, but I savored those moments. ‘Cause it wasn’t any sweat, to be honest. I liked walking. It’s not like I was stressed on the walk. I’d be kicking stones, singing on the way back. I’d get to the house and be like, “No, wait a minute. Hmm.” I loved it ’cause that was the one moment when I was allowed to give my mom unlimited attitude with no repercussions. None. ‘Cause when I was a kid, you couldn’t give attitude to your parents. I wasn’t a white child. You know what I mean? You couldn’t… I had to watch myself. But when she messed up, ooh, I loved it. She’d be like, “Can you forgive me, baby?” I’ll be like, “I’ll think about',\n",
              "  ' it.” Now I had to find somebody to help me. I look around, there’s an older French gentleman standing on the side, gray hair, rosy cheeks, short little guy with glasses. So I walked over to him. And he was wearing a red vest. And in French, it read “Information,” and then underneath in English said, “Information.” I was like, “Phew!” “Ah. Bonjour. Hello. Hi.” He’s like, “Hello. Bonjour.” I said, “English, French?” Said, “English, yeah, oui.” I said, “Could you help me, please?” “Um… My, um… My luggage didn’t arrive.” “Um, I would like to know, what do I need to do?” He’s like, “There’s your luggage… It didn’t come…” [incoherent English in French accent] [in normal voice] I was like, “Okay.” Um… “All right.” “Let’s try French.” “Let’s, uh, see what happens.” Finally, we figured it out. He sent me off to a special area where you go and make a report. There’s another French guy behind the counter, much younger. He was maybe Algerian or Moroccan of descent. Very French, very French. Cool guy. He’s helping somebody. “Okay, thank you very much. Next, please.” I walk up, “Hey, man.” He’s like, “What’s going on, my brother?” “How are you? What’s up with you?” I was like, “I need your help, please.” “My luggage, um, it didn’t come. It’s, uh, lost.” He’s like, “Oh, no, dude, your luggage didn’t come.” “Oh, man.” “Did you look for it?” I said, “What? Yeah, that’s the first thing I did.” “You think I’m here for company?” “Of course, that’s…” He’s like, “No. Just checking.” “So, the bag is gone? It’s totally…” I’m like, “Yeah.” He’s like, “Oh, man, that sucks, man, I’m so sorry for you, man.” “That’s terrible.” “Yeah. So, what do you want to do now?” “What do I want to do?” I said, “I would like you to do something.” “Can we make a report or something?” “You want to make some paperwork or something?” “It’s for your for your insurance so they can pay you for it?” I said, “No, it’s so that you can find it and bring it to me.” He’s like, “Oh, don’t worry, man.” “We are not going to find it.” “No, man.” “Don’t worry about that.” “No. You know, it’s Paris, man.” “When the bags are gone, they’re probably gone.” “They don’t ever pop up. Sometimes, if you’re lucky.” “But if it is not here by now, it’s probably gone.” “It’s Friday. There are some strikes. Just…” “You can leave. Don’t stress yourself. You can go.” It’s like, “Don’t even stress…” “Yo, It’s my luggage.” “That’s all my clothes.” He’s like, “But you are in Paris.” “You need clothes? This is Paris, man.” “Come on, Paris, go and buy some clothes.” “What’s wrong with you, man? Chill.” He was so confident, he made me feel like I was wrong. Like, I doubted myself. I walked away and I was like, “Am I ',\n",
              "  \"wrong?” “Am I too attached to my luggage?” He wasn’t lying. Paris has a great selection of clothing. I had to go and buy clothes because I had nothing for my shows, for anything. And if you ever do go to Paris, take some extra money for the clothes shopping. It’s amazing. And try and also pack an extra pair of self-esteem. Yeah, you’ll need it when you shop with the French. ‘Cause they’re not your friends. Yeah. I’ve never been to a country where you are truly on your own when you’re shopping. You walk into a store, nobody helps you. Nothing. You don’t know who works there, who’s doing anything. Literally, it’s like Undercover Employee. Just walking around. [chuckles] It was 20 minutes, nobody helped me. Finally I started picking my own clothes, and I heard an annoyed voice behind me. “Can I help you?” I was like, “Hi. Yes. I need to get clothes, please.” “My luggage was lost.” And then, Detroit, I got roasted more than I’ve ever been roasted in my life. Ever. Ever. Everything I chose came with a scathing review. I was like, “Yeah, could I please, um, get this in a medium?” He was like, “Medium? No, you mean large or extra-large, no?” “Yeah, no, this one is medium for your body?” “I don’t think so, no?” I was like, “I’m sorry, what?” He’s like, “I think you’re a large. I can bring that one for you.” “Medium is too much for the shirt, okay?” [chuckling] I’m like, “What?” Yo, everything, everything. There was a jacket I wanted to buy. “Could I get this?” He’s like, “No, this one for your skin tone is not great.” “No, You have to think about what is complementary for the colors inside the fabric and also inside your face, okay?” “This one is not the best.” I was like, “Yo, I already own something like this.” He’s like, “Ah, and you’re wearing it?” “Well, not anymore.” “No, you can wear it if you want.” “C’est tranquille. Go ahead.” “No, you threatened me now.” You know what? It’s just different. A friend said to me, “Dude, the French are assholes, right?” I was like, “I don’t think that they’re assholes.” “I think they’re just very honest.” All right? It’s hard to tell the difference between the two. ‘Cause one day I was speaking to a French woman and I worked up the courage to ask her, I said, “Hey, um…” “Why are the French… like this?” And she said, “What do you mean?” I said, “When you’re in a store, they seem very mean.” “No, they’re not being mean. They’re just being themselves, no?” “Maybe because you are used to coming in a country where people, they are so afraid that you’re not going to tip them, that they are all on top of you.” “‘Can I help you? Can I help you?'” “But in France, we make sure that everybody is getting a good sala\",\n",
              "  \"ry.” “A good wage.” “So we are not, you know, so stressed about that.” “In America, it’s like, ‘The customer is king.'” “But in France, you know what we do to kings.” “So, you know…” “It’s not the same here.” The French don’t play that game. You’ve been so much fun tonight, Detroit. Thank you. [audience cheering] Thank you so much. Proved me right. This is why you go to Detroit. For real. It’s an amazing audience. Beautiful, diverse. And the city’s been cool, too. We’ve been seeing a few things here and there. I had a fight with my friend Dave. He directs these specials and he said to me one day, “Yo, what are you doing during the day?” And I was, “Might go eat, do something.” He’s like, “Dude, why don’t we go check out all the museums in Detroit?” I was like, “Maybe like one.” He said, “What do you mean, one?” I was like, “Yeah, not all. What do you mean, all?” He’s like, “Dude, have you been here before?” “You know how many amazing museums they got?” “Yes, but it’s still a museum.” “I’ll do like one, and that’s it.” “I don’t have that much stamina. I can’t do as many as you.” “What do you mean you can’t do as many as me?” “Dude, because you’re white, like, you enjoy doing that.” And I was just joking. I was just teasing him. Just teasing him. He got so offended so quickly, right? [laughs] He’s like, “What did you say?” “Because you’re…” He’s like, “Dude, white people don’t love museums.” “What are you even talking about?” “Like, museums aren’t even in the top five things white people love, okay?” He said it with such confidence. and with such conviction, I was like, “What is the top five?” ‘Cause what a strange… “That’s not even in the top five.” Like, in his bedroom, he has a list on the wall of the top ten things. [laughing] It was amazing. I thought about it. I was like, “No, it is.” “I stick with my decision.” Museums would be. ‘Cause, no, it’s not even a bad thing. White people love museums. A lot of people enjoy museums, but white people love museums. Love museums. There’s not a single place on Earth where white people have settled and not built a museum. It doesn’t matter. White people love museums. You ever seen white people in a museum? Walking around smiling with their hands behind their back? “Yep, that was us.” “That was us, too.” “It’s been a good run.” White people love museums. I wouldn’t put it at number one, but it’d be in the top five. I thought about it. If there were top five things white people love, I’d put museums at number five. At number four, I’d put swimming. All right? ‘Cause white people love swimming. Nothing wrong with that. Have you seen white people swim? You look stunning. Stunning. When white people \",\n",
              "  'swim, you do that thing with your hair. You come out of the water, like… [imitates whooshing] Just go perfectly back like a duck. I would love swimming, too. White people love swimming. White people love swimming so much, that they made it that you can win more medals at the Olympics, swimming, than any other discipline. Yeah, that’s how much white people love swimming. I realized this one day. There was an argument going on about who the greatest Olympian of all time is. And the final two was Michael Phelps and Usain Bolt. And then one of the arguments was, “Well, Michael Phelps is better because he has more medals.” And I was like, “Yeah, because he cheated.” “He won them swimming.” I’m not saying Michael Phelps is not great. I’m saying you can’t count the medals in the argument. Because in swimming it’s the only discipline where you win more medals for doing the same thing in a slightly less efficient manner. It makes no sense. Think about it. It’s like, “100-meter freestyle.” [imitates beep] [panting] Done. Gold medal. Yeah. And now this. Another medal. Yeah. And this one? Another medal. But what about this one? Another medal. That’s some bullshit. I don’t care what anyone says. You can’t win more medals. Usain Bolt doesn’t have that luxury. When Usain Bolt runs, it’s the 100-meter and it’s done. “On your marks, set…” Run, run, run, run. Get to the end, win, gold medal. That’s it. He can’t turn around like, “Amazing race. And now I’m going to do it butterfly style.” It’s not a thing. I mean, it should be, but it’s not. White people love swimming, so they made up the rule. I get it. It would have to be, yeah. Of my top five things, I’d go museums at number five, swimming at number four. Number three, being flabbergasted. White people love being flabbergasted. Come on. You know exactly what I’m talking about. Have you ever seen when a white person’s having a bad day, something’s gone wrong, they do that thing with their face, get flabbergasted like… White people love being flabbergasted. You’ll see it in supermarkets all the time. There’s like a long line. All right? But only one cashier is open. [chuckles] Everyone’s standing patiently. There’s always one white person who pops out like… “Why don’t they open the other…” “Are you serious?” “What are they… Are you…” The only thing white people love more is finding another white person to flabbergast with. Have you seen that? Yo, whenever that happens, magic. It is absolute magic. A white person will be flabbergasting. They’ll make eye contact with another white person, and then they’ll flabbergast together. It’s like they Voltron their flabbergasting into a super flabbergast. You see th',\n",
              "  'em look over. “You see this?” “I know.” [sighing] That’s one of the keys to flabbergasting. You have to exhale. Let it all out. Life is so hard that the air has to leave your body. You can no longer even breathe. [sighing heavily] That’s why there’s so many tornadoes in the Midwest. It’s just white people flabbergasting… [sighing vigorously] White people love being flabbergasted. Has to be. Has to be top five. That would be my list. Top five things white people love. I’ve got museums at number five. All right, swimming at number four. Being flabbergasted, number three. Number two, being white. It’s a sweet gig. I don’t blame you. And then there’s number one. And look, this is my personal list. I’m not dictating anything. If you don’t agree, make your own, right? It’s a personal preference. But there is one thing, and one thing alone, that white people love more than anything on this planet. “Sweet Caroline.” Let me tell you something, Detroit. There is nothing that brings more joy to the soul of a white person than the sounds of that Neil Diamond song. I don’t care where it is. I’ve been on every continent, in many countries. When that song plays, you see white people’s eyes light up… like sleeper agents who’ve just been activated. It happens every time, without fail. Every single time. It’s not about music, other songs will be playing. They’ll be at a cookout or a baseball game, a company event. All the other songs are in the background. They pay them no heed. But when that song kicks in, it taps into the very DNA of whiteness. I don’t know what it is. But it interrupts everything else. You’ll see white people hanging out. They’ll be like, “Yeah, business, mergers and acquisitions.” “It’s one of those things.” “I know, we should circle back.” “Let’s put a pin in it.” [blabbering] And that song comes in, and every single time… You think it won’t happen. It always creeps in. It always seems like it won’t happen. But it’s always the same, just like… ♪ Hands, touchin’ hands ♪\\n♪ Reachin’ out, touchin’ me ♪\\n♪ Touchin’ you Pum, pum, pum ♪\\n♪ Sweet Caroline ♪ [audience humming the tune] See, I didn’t tell you to join in. I didn’t say, “All together now.” Or, “On the count of three.” That was just your whiteness coming out. Did you feel that? Huh? That was just you. You were like, “This is it!” “This is our moment!” ♪ Oh, oh, oh ♪ ♪ I’m white, white, white, white ♪ ♪ White, white ♪ Look at you right now. You’re beaming! Look at your face. Look at you. Look at that joy. Ten minutes ago, “I don’t know about this guy.” Now you’re like, “Best comedian ever!” Don’t ever lose that joy. None of you white people. You hold on to it. It is a treasure. It ',\n",
              "  'is the most adorable thing in the world. Nothing makes white people happier than that song. Nothing. That song is pure, uncut Caucasian joy. That’s what that song is. White people cannot resist it. Yeah, forget 23andMe. If you want to know how much white you have in you, play that song. The louder you respond, the whiter you are. I just saved you some money. There’s no white person I’ve seen… It is the Marco to your Polo. That’s what that song is. I’ll tell you, if there was ever, like, a giant earthquake, God forbid, and people were trapped beneath the rubble, I’d volunteer to find all the white people. I’ll be like, “You guys find everybody else.” “I got this. I got this!” ♪ “Sweet Caroline” ♪ “I found another one!” “You okay, man?” [coughs to the beat of “Sweet Caroline”] Right now some of you are like, “Trevor, we like that song, but it’s not the most important to us.” Yeah? Then how come you didn’t help me sing the anthem? Detroit, you have been amazing. Thank you so much. I had such a great time with all of you. I appreciate you. Good night.

              "[['Hey, it’s Andrew Santino, and here I am in my hometown, Chicago, Illinois, where I’m shooting my stand-up comedy special, but before I do, I want to take you around my city, and I want to show you the gems that people don’t talk about, locals-only type of stuff. Hey, excuse me. Can I get a ride? No. Okay. Fair enough. Chicago. Well, I have a meeting, and I don’t know you. It’s fine. I get that. Why should I even… You know, that’s an odd question to ask. You’re right. Now that I think about it… In the city here, with all the crime and everything, – just hop in and get a ride? You’re right. Best city in the world, baby… Chicago. Boom, a local spot… Willis Tower, on the corner, of course, of Jackson and Wacker. Now, Jackson and Wacker is famous ’cause of Andrew Jackson and because people used to get whacked. Right below me, the Chicago Pond, a beautiful piece of water. People swim in here. Olympics train in this thing. Jordan actually was inside the mold when they molded him. They cracked it, pulled him out, reassembled it. Boom. Here we are at The Wiener’s Circle, bro… The best hot dog in Chicago. And they treat me like I’m from here. Come on in. Hey, let me get a hot dog, ladies. How do you want it? You know how I want it, man. What, up your ass or down your fucking throat? Come on, order correctly, pussy lips. Let’s get it together. Before I continue this tour, I’m gonna get a drink. Ah, double fisting. Chi Town is a drinking city. Everybody knows that. Ah, beers for the crew, beers for the crew, beers for the crew. Cheers, you guys. Cheers. Okay, we had more planned. We’re never gonna get to it. You want to know more about Chicago, Google it, okay? Enjoy the special. Cheers. Ladies and gentlemen, it gives me great pleasure to introduce you to my grandson… Andrew Santino. We did it. We did it. Yes. Chicago, Illinois, my hometown, how are you? Yes. Crazy. That’s my grandmother, man. Yeah, that’s the best thing in the world. My grandmother brought me up. Give it up for Mary Garrity, man. Cheers. Cheers to you guys. Cheers. My grandfather, who passed away, used to say… A waitress would bring him water, and he would say, ‘What is that?’ And she’d say, ‘It’s water.’ And he said, ‘I’m thirsty, not dirty, so get me a drink.’ So cheers to my grandpa. Here we are, Chi Town. We did it. We came a long way. We’re here. I’m so happy to be back in this city. I’m back home. It’s amazing. I’m feeling the vibe again. You know what I mean? I took a walk around the lake. I was listening to conversations, two guys arguing, yelling at each other with that thick Chicago accent. You know, that… Ah, Chicago. It’s Chicago. ‘A’ s are ahs. Chi-cah-go. And Ts are Ds. Over dere in Chi-cah-go. You know that? ‘A’s, ahs, T, Ds, everyone’s racist. It’s such a good city. What a city. I heard two men fighting. Two men were in an argument, in just a verbal argument, not anything bigger than that, just arguing, and the one guy goes, ‘You know what? Why don’t you suck my dick?’ And the other guy goes, ‘Pfft! You suck my dick.’ And I was like, ‘Hey, suck each other’s dicks, man.’ That would’ve been a fight to see, huh? Comes up like, ‘You motherfucker.’ Finish him. Finish him. We got to stop saying it like that. Guys have to stop saying it like that ’cause girls are gonna start believing it. It has a negative connotation when you say that. You go, ‘Suck my dick.’ We say it negative. Suck my dick. You say it like it’s a bad thing. It’s the best thing in the world. It’s the best thing that’s ever happened to me. We should say it nice. You should go, ‘Hey! ‘Suck my dick, please, if you have time. ‘If you don’t, it’s not a big deal. I would love it a lot.’ I’m proud of being from this town. I love this town. I miss it a lot. It’s where my family is from. My family’s still here. It’s great to come home, see my parents. They’re getting older, which is weird. That’s a hard thing, to see your parents get older… Li',\n",
              "  'ke, honest older, You know when your parents just say shit that when you were a kid, you were like, ‘Oh, you never used to say shit like that when I was a kid.’ Like, my mom was like, ‘Well, I’m gonna leave the house. What are you gonna do for the weekend?’ And my dad was watching TV, and he turns, and he goes, ‘Eat steak, watch porn.’ I applaud the honesty out of that guy, really sharp. I appreciate that. Tell her the truth, man. They’re getting older. You know what I mean? They get older, but I love that about these people. They’re fantastic. They raised me. I mean, did they raise me correctly? I don’t know. Maybe not. I grew up here in downtown Chicago for half of my life in Chicago. In the second half, we moved to the western suburbs, right? We moved to the suburbs ’cause my sister was born, and my parents were like, ‘I’ m not gonna fuck up two of them. ‘We can’t do that. One’s good. We’ll fuck up one. That’s okay.’ We moved to the western suburbs, you know, to try to better the life of all of us, but, like, I still realize sometimes how, like, my mom used to fuck with us subtly. Like, my mom is crazy. She’s a crazy person in the best way, but she would, like, lay it in real slow. Like, my parents were somewhat religious, right? You know, I mean, Irish Catholic kind of. You know what I mean? Like, somewhat in, you know what I mean? They’re, like, in the hot tub maybe. But she used to do this thing. She used to make me say, every single night before I went to bed, ‘Now I lay me down to sleep.’ Do you know that? Does anybody know that? I used to have to say this. I used to have to repeat this. I ‘d say,’ Now I lay me down to sleep. ‘I pray the Lord my soul to keep, ‘and if I die before I wake, I pray the Lord my soul to take.’ I would say that before bed, which is a really fucked-up thing… for a child to say out loud. If I die before I wake up? I’m six. I’m gonna die in the middle of the night, and God’s gonna leave my body, take my soul, but be like, ‘Body’ s good. Leave the body. It’s fine. Leave it.’ What’s going on? Crazy person. I love her. She’s the best in the world. I had Irish Catholic guilt. I had so much Irish Catholic guilt when I was a kid, I used to flip a coin to determine whether or not I was gonna masturbate that day. You think I’m kidding? I would take a quarter. I would go, ‘Heads, yes, tails, no.’ I’d flip it, I’d get tails, and I’d go, ‘Ah, best two out of three. We got to go again. Let ‘s see what happens.’ He didn’t beat me, never won. That’s how heavy my guilt was. Seriously, that’s how, like, in my head I was about that God-is-watching-you type of stuff. Like, my mother used to let us not lock the doors. She was against it. She was like, ‘You don’ t lock the doors inside of the house. ‘If you’ re locking the doors inside of the house, it means you’re doing something you shouldn’t be doing.’ Yeah, that’s why we lock the doors. Don’t come in here. I’m pulling on my body. Get out of here. Leave me alone, lady. That’s how I realized the guy that invented locks inside of a house must’ve been caught masturbating by his wife one too many times. He was sick of it. He was sick of it. He’s like, ‘You know what? That’s it. I’m gonna put locks inside the house.’ She ‘s like,’ Michael, what are you doing? ‘We have locks on the outside of the house ‘to keep criminals from coming inside. There’s no criminals inside of this house.’ Yes, there are, Karen, and they’re robbing me of my freedom. Let me pull on my body in peace. Leave me alone, Karen. Anyway, I love being from this city, and now I live in Los Angeles, California. I live on the other side of this great country. I like it out there. It’s okay. It’s a second home for me. It takes some getting used to. It’s a little bit difficult, but the big difference is, like, when I come back home, you know, like, all my mom wants to do is talk about, like, the weather. Like, that’s a big thing. My mom is like, ',\n",
              "  '‘How is the weather in California? Is it nice like this?’ It’s like, ‘Yeah, it’s better than this. That’s why I’m out there. What are you talking about?’ It’s always better. It’s always better. It is. There’s a lot of stuff that isn’t better, but the weather’s always gonna be better, and she loves bringing up the ‘feels like’ meter. You know what that is? The news guy. The news guy’s like, ‘It’s 62. Feels like 68.’ That’s Midwest hope. That’s hope circulating in your body. It’s the greatest lie ever told. Who’s the ‘feels like’ guy? I want that job. If that’s a job, I want it tonight. I’ll drop this bullshit gig and go do that tonight. The ‘feels like’ guy… Greatest gig ever. Here in the studio, it’s 62 on the barometer. We’re gonna go live to Andrew Santino. Andrew, what does it feel like? How’s it going, news team? Like 67. Right back to you guys. Back to you guys, man. It’s nice, really nice out. It’s crazy, man, ’cause the weather here fluctuates so much. Like, when I come back, you’re never surprised. Like, you’re never surprised by anything in Chicago, but, like, who I feel bad for when I come back is the homeless people. I always feel bad for homeless here, man. Like, I don’t feel bad for homeless people in L.A. People can get mad at me for saying that. I don’t give a shit. They’re awful human beings, these L.A. homeless people. They’re terrible. They’re terrible people. I feel bad for Chicago homeless, right? Because they die in the winter, and they die in the summer. They’re never not dying. They’re always dying. There’s, like, a week when it’s like, ‘We might make it,’ and that’s it, and they bucket-drum their way through that week. Soldiers, man. So I feel bad for homeless people in Chicago, from my heart, ’cause this is my home. So, when I come home, I give money. I gave money today to a homeless guy. I’m not lying. I gave money to a homeless guy ’cause I feel bad for him. I know what he’s got to go through. I gave that money to that guy, right? And I’ll always do that, but I also want to look him in the eye and go, ‘Hey, start walking south. You have nothing to do tomorrow. What are you doing here? You have something on your calendar? You don ‘t have a calendar.’ You can air-fistfight dragons all over this great country. I’m sure there’s half-smoked cigarettes strewn across this great land. I mean, the wind is their therapist. That’s all over the place. They can move about, man. You know the birds? You know those things? You know those guys? When they leave, follow those guys. Birds are born instinctively knowing, when it gets cold, to be like, ‘Oh, let’ s get the fuck out of here. ‘It’ s cold. Let’s leave. This is ridiculous. Why are we here? This is ridiculous.’ But I don’t feel bad for homeless people in Los Angeles at all… I really don’t. I don’t. I don’t feel bad for them. Some people are like, ‘Oh, that’s kind of mean.’ I don’t give a shit. I don’t give a shit, ’cause I live amongst these people, and they’re rude. They’re rude. You know why they’re rude? ‘Cause they made it. They’re at the promised land. It’s 72 degrees outside. You know what it is inside my place? Seventy-two. Who pays for that? I do. Fuck those guys. They won the lottery. They sleep on the beach. I came out of a restaurant, right? I came out of a restaurant. When I first moved there, I had no money. I had zero money. Came out of a restaurant, had some leftovers, went up to a homeless guy, said, ‘Hey, sir, I got some leftovers. Would you like this?’ Okay? I’m on a date, in front of a lady. Would you like this, sir? And the homeless guy looks up at me, and he says, ‘What’s in it?’ And I looked at him, and I said, ‘Tomorrow.’ Another day on this earth. What are you, gluten-free? Eat the food. You’re cock-blocking me, man. I’m trying to smash a five. Help me out. What are you doing? Why are you doing this? Times are tough. Who are you? But I like it. It’s my second home. This is my fi',\n",
              "  'rst home. L.A.’s my second home, and I do like it. There is things about it that I like. I live now in Los Angeles in a neighborhood called West Hollywood. West Hollywood is a gay neighborhood. It’s kind of like up here. It’s like where we are right now, Boystown. I like the gay neighborhood. The gay neighborhood is the best neighborhood. I’ve ever lived in in my life. It’s safe. It’s beautiful. I love it. I love it. You get in where you fit in, and I fit into that neighborhood, okay? I’m not gay, Dad, but… I’m down to live around gay people. They keep it clean and safe. I’ve never been attacked once in my neighborhood, and by the way, if I did get attacked, I would love to be attacked. What a beautiful way to walk home. A guy leaps out of a bush. Where are you going? Where are you going? Where? Where? Gives me outfit tips. They can fly, you know. I have a lot of gay friends because of that. They’re people just like you and me. There’s nothing different. There’s nothing different about that neighborhood. It’s cleaner and safer, and I fucking love it. The only difference is, I got a big beard. I’ve had big beard. I got to keep a big beard for a while. And that’s okay. Gay guys love guys with beards. Why? I don’t know. It’s a thing. It’s an underbelly thing. It’s on the Internet. Look it up. And I often get hit on. I get hit on a lot, okay? I get hit on way more in the gay community than in the straight community, and I’m okay with that. It’s a confidence booster, fellas. It feels nice. But I’ve lived in a gay neighborhood for so long that now I’m picky about what gay guy hits on me. A gay guy hollers at me, and I’m like, ‘All right, you couldn’t handle it, dude. ‘You couldn’ t handle it. Too tight, too tight. ‘Keep walking, man. Pinch it right off. Get up out of here, man.’ Couldn’t have it. That’s some true shit. You got to be careful of social cues. Social cues mean a lot, right? And guys are stupid. Men are stupid. We’re stupid people by nature. We’re just dumb. We don’t give a shit, by the way, when girls are like, ‘Men are dumb.’ I don’t care. You think I care you think I’m dumb? I don’t give a shit. I know I’m dumb. It feels really good. Try going out your day without talking about a relationship. That’s what you guys do all day. It’s like, ‘I heard he was with her, but then she was’… And we just walk around like… It’s great. It’s fantastic. I don’t worry about shit. It makes my day so much easier, but guys are idiots, and I’m proud to be an idiot. But social cues amongst men are interesting because you got to be careful what you do in my neighborhood, right? Like, in my neighborhood, it’s a little bit different, ’cause when I walk down the street and I see another guy, right, I do this thing. If I see you, and I walk down the street, right, we pass each other, and I go like this, what do you do? If I go like… Yeah, you dude me right back, right. You dude me right back. He dudes me. We dude it. Hey, dude it. We dude it. Do we know why we dude? No. Zero clue. We walk around like pigeons all day like, ‘Hey, hey.’ We don’t give a shit. I do it to black guys to show them that I’m not a pussy. I go, ‘Hey, what’ s up? We good, we good? ‘We’re good. I’m good with the black guy. ‘In case a fight breaks out, we got a black guy. ‘We’ re good. We got one. We’re good, we’re good. We got him.’ I have no idea why we do that. We share genitalia. There’s no other reason that we do that to one another. But you can’t do that in my neighborhood ’cause it means something totally different… and it hurts. It hurts a lot. I like living there. I do like it. I really do. Like, I like living in Los Angeles. I like progressive culture, okay? I really do. I like the way that people think about other people as humans instead of a subset, right? This country got all up in arms. Everybody voted to make bathrooms gender-neutral. I don’t know if you know about that, but there was a big debate go',\n",
              "  'ing on around this country about should we make bathrooms gender… Should we be able to let other people use bathrooms that didn’t initially have that genitalia, right? People that are transsexual. Should we let them use our bathrooms? Ooh, careful. Who knows what could happen? What could happen? Nothing. They’re gonna shit in your bathroom that you shit in. You think your bathroom’s that important, where you let go of all your fluids. You care that much about your fluids that you care who comes after. When I go in there, I ‘m like,’ Aah! ‘There better be someone else decent that comes in after me. ‘I don’ t want some transsexual coming in after that. Who knows what they ‘ll do?’ Who do you think you are? It was a big debate, gender-neutral bathrooms. And I’m all for it. Bathrooms are bathrooms. I don’t give a shit who uses my bathroom after me. Use it. You got to go, go ahead. Use the bathroom, man. It’s a good thing. For years, I was sick and tired of going to a bar and seeing girls cut the bathroom line when theirs are too long. They walk to the guys, and they go, ‘Hi, our line’ s too long. ‘Do you think me… Can we cut? Is this chill if we cut?’ I know that’s a stereotypical impression. I don’t give a shit. That’s real. ‘Can we cut?’ That’s real. And every asshole in line is like, ‘Yeah, go ahead.’ Also real, also real, also a real impression of us. You go like that. We go like that. Okay? So guys let them in, and I’m tired of that shit, ’cause we can’t use your bathrooms. Guys can’t use girls’ bathrooms at bars. You can use ours. Why can’t we use yours? The only thing I ever hear is, ‘Well, you pee on the seat.’ Do we? I don’t. I don’t pee on the seat. If you live with someone that pees on the seat, it’s ’cause they hate your fucking guts. They’re sending you a message. Oh, no, you get the groceries, Karen, you fucking bitch. Fucking asshole. He’s saying something to you. That’s between you two. What do you think? You think we walk in the bathroom, we just open it up, and let it go, and it’s, like, wherever it goes, it goes. I know where it goes. I got a laser pointer. I know precisely where it goes. Pff, right there. Pee on the seat. That’s amazing. It’s ridiculous. To me, I think the fix has always been remove the stalls from men’s bathrooms in bars. Remove them. Urinals or just holes in the ground, it doesn’t really matter. Guys will pee into anything. We don’t really give a shit. But get the stalls out of men’s bathrooms in bars because they shouldn’t be there in the first place, okay? They should never have been there, ’cause a girl can’t walk in now and use a urinal. Unless you can, ladies, and then I want to see it. If you can tippy-toe pee, I would love to see it. I don’t know if it’s this way or that way. I don’t know which way is better, but if you can do that, I want to check it out. But there shouldn’t be stalls in men’s bathrooms in bars in the first place, because who the fuck is pooping at the bar? You’re gonna poop at the bar? You’re gonna poop here? Steve, you’re gonna poop at the bar. The bar that we’re at, you’re gonna poop at this bar? You feel okay with that as a person, pooping at the bar? Okay, now I know who you really are. Pooping at the… Who are your friends? Who’s your family? Go home, you animal. What are you, you pig person? Poop at the bar? Are you out of your mind? You’re gross. You’re a gross human. You don’t poop at the bar. You man up if you have to poop. You man up if you have to poop. You finish your drink, pinch it off, and you walk home, so you can poop at the house naked like a grown-up… like a full-grown adult. If you’re pooping at the bar that I’m at and I see you doing that, I’m gonna walk in, look under, walk out, and go, ‘Hey, there’ s a guy pooping here ‘wearing blue Adidas. Blue Adidas, yeah. He ‘s pooping right now.’ And then leave you with your mistake. Why is everybody looking at my shoes? ‘Cause you pooped here, Mik',\n",
              "  'e. What’s wrong with you? Get your life locked up, pig. Go home, you pig. Say that next time you see someone pooping in a bathroom. Walk in and go, ‘Go home, you pig. You make me sick.’ Unbelievable, man, how we prote… We protect the bathrooms like they’re a big deal. Who gives a shit about the bathrooms? Dude, go to the bathroom. We protect bathrooms in this country like it’s something important. It’s remarkable to me. Sometimes you go to a restaurant, and you’re like, ‘Hey, can I get the key to the bathroom? It’s locked.’ They’re like, ‘Oh, yeah, we got the key. Here you go.’ It’s attached to a comically large ladle for no reason. You got a spoon on the goddamn thing. Now you got to take that in there, find a place for it. It’s gonna be a nightmare. Go ahead. You’re gonna hate every second of that. Why do we do that? We lock them. You keep the bathroom under lock and key? You realize in every restaurant, every restaurant you can walk right in, go right into the kitchen? There’s no locks on a kitchen. Just walk in and go, ‘Hey, what’s up, you guys?’ Dunk your hand in some soup. More salt. Needs more salt. I got to go. I want to use the bathroom. You got the key? No. Get real. It’s a weird country, man. We live in a weird country. We live in a weird time. I didn’t want to talk about anything that’s going on right now, but because I got a lot of time, it’s the late show, I’ll do whatever the fuck I want. So let me say this. I’m proud to be from where I’m from, okay? I’m proud to be from Chicago, Illinois. I’m proud to be from the United States of America. I’m not trying to get on a patriotic kick. All I want to say is, we got some fucked-up things going on in our country. Times are really crazy. It’s unfortunate as fuck. It’s awful. People on both sides are blaming people on both sides, okay? I have cops that are in my family. Every cop is not a bad fucking person, and every person isn’t a bad person, right? These are the same fucking things. So don’t point fingers at either side. We need to be better people in general, across the fucking board. That’s it. That’s it. Good. I’m a… I’m a guy who recently, thankfully, found a woman who was dumb enough to stick around. Stupid girl, stupid girl. ‘Cause look at this, you know. Like, look at guys. You’re gross. Why would they even go for us? Why would a woman want to do stuff with you? You’re gross. You’re disgusting. Look at a naked woman. Take one look at a naked woman, right? Beautiful, symmetrical, hairless. What a creature. Whatever made it finely crafted it like a Ferrari, you know? Took time with it. And then they got to the guy, and they were like, ‘Ah, we ran out of time. ‘No, put the genitals on the outside. ‘It doesn’ t matter. ‘No one’ s gonna see. Who cares? ‘Hair? Throw some hair on it. Fine, throw some hair on it.’ It’s phenomenal. Every day we’ve fooled you. Like, we should wake up, guys, and just be like, ‘Ah, tricked them. ‘We tricked them again. We got away with murder.’ I don’t know how we ever convinced you to do anything in the first place. Kiss me where I pee? Kiss me where I pee? How? How? How? You know that place that you breathe and eat from? May I stuff my dick in there? Can I clog up your source of life with some flesh? Life, the life hole, can I just… Cork it? I want to cork it. I want to cork your life hole with my body. How on earth did you say yes? Cork it? It’s a remarkable thing, when you think about it. Like, how did we ever even start the sexual chemistry to even get to that level of doing stuff? Here you go. A guy can go to a bar. A single guy goes to a bar trying to pick up chicks. He can go out there and mumble around. I want to put my body in your body. That’s all he’s saying. Baseline level, I want to put my body in your body. Can we do that? You sound debonair at the bar. You ‘re like,’ Well, well, I work for an investment firm downtown.’ But what you’re really saying is, like, ‘I wan',\n",
              "  't to put my body in your body. I’d like to put my body inside of your body.’ That’s all it is. You’re not that cool. You’re just trying to put some of your body in someone’s body. You got a gap. I got a wedge. Can we do the thing when I put the thing in the thing? That’s it. Think about that… That’s a hard thing to do, to go out to a bar and convince a girl I’m the guy that you want to do things with. Think about how hard it was for us to start that. How did we start that? How did a caveman ever get to that point with a cave woman? How did a caveman say that when there was no language, no communication skills? First of all, when you were a caveman, you just stood around with your buddies, mumbling. That’s it. There’s really nothing going on, just a lot of… Then one of you, out of nowhere, would just get an erection. Explain that to the crew. All your buddies are mad. Hey! They don’t like it pointing at them. You got to be a nonverbal dick salesman, going up to women like… What are you selling? She doesn’t know. You can’t say it. Who said yes? The slowest girl in the pack… on a bad leg she was lugging around. Okay, okay. Okay. How did that happen? The guy that convinced a girl to do that for the first time invented fire and the wheel that afternoon. It was like… Everything clicked. I got it. Everything made sense. I would’ve loved to see the first caveman to discover pulling out. That would’ve been amazing. Right? The first guy that’s like… That’s how all that shit on the wall got started. They were like… What, do you think that was ink? That was no ink. It’s jizz symbols. How great is that fucking thing? My buddy’s an artist, and I was like, ‘I want a fucking papa bear ‘with a cubby bear with a Blackhawks headdress, ‘and I want him wearing Jordans for the Bulls ‘and white socks, and I want him eating deep dish and drinking a beer.’ And my buddy smoked enough pot as I did, and he came up with this. So it was fucking pretty amazing. The Chicago flag, yeah. Cool. It’s cool. We got a lot of pride in this town, so we should. You know what I mean? You can’t fuck with us. Come fuck with us. Where’s my crane camera? Come fuck with us, rest of the United States. Where the fuck are you guys at? Come to Chicago. Rip your fucking throats out. I’m gonna get murdered on the road in Cincinnati in, like, three months. Shit. No, I got a lady. I got a lady this year. I got locked up. I got married this year, which was great. It was a great thing. Don’t clap for that. Please don’t clap for that shit ’cause it eggs her on, and I don’t need that. No, I got married, and it was great. It was very fun. We had a good time. Yeah, it was fun. Thanks a lot. Cool. It was cool, it was cool. She came up to me at the jump, and she was like, she ‘s like,’ What do you think about doing, like, bachelor, bachelorette parties, like, all that stuff?’ We didn’t talk about, like, really any of that stuff. We really kind of didn’t really get into the nitty-gritty, and I was like, ‘Well, whatever you want to do.’ She was like, ‘Do you want to have a bachelor party?’ And I was like, ‘I don’ t know. ‘Like, I do stand-up for a living, ‘so, like, it’ s just always kind of a fucking bachelor party. My life is kind of a bachelor party.’ I was like, ‘No, I’m good.’ You know what I mean? Like, I just took my best friend for his bachelor party, and I was like, ‘That’s good enough for me.’ I was like, ‘You can do a bachelorette party. Don ‘t feel like you can’t.’ She was like, ‘Are you cool with it?’ I was like, ‘I promise. I’m totally cool with it. Whatever you want to do, you ‘re good. Do it.’ She was like, ‘Okay, trust me. It ‘ll be classy.’ That’s some dumb shit. Girls are like, ‘It’ s gonna be classy. ‘The bachelorette party… It’s gonna be cla… I promise. We won’t be as crazy as you think we’re gonna be.’ She was like, ‘We’ re going to Northern California ‘to a vineyard. We ‘re gonna do wine tasting.’ So in girls’',\n",
              "  ' brains, they think that we think that that’s nice and sweet, but I know the truth. I know they’re not wine tasting. I know they’re blacking out on wine. I know they’re getting purple toothed out, Charlie Chaplain-ing around town like… I know. I know what you’re doing, looking like Grimace. I know. I know. Lie to me, you drunks… trying to pretend like… We pretend like wine is so sophisticated. It’s still booze. Stinky-foot grapes, that’s all it is. Go on a vineyard tour with her girlfriends. See, ’cause here’s the thing about bachelorette parties. I’m sure every girl in this room is a wonderful human being. I’m sure you’re all stand-up citizens until you get in a bachelorette party, and then you’re a piece of shit. Then you’re a piece of shit. Then you storm around town like, ‘Look at us, penises everywhere. ‘Penises on our body. ‘Penis necklace. These are dick-laces. ‘These are dick necklaces. This is a dick hat. ‘These are dick glasses. They’re dick shoes. ‘Look at it. It comes. This one comes. ‘It comes out of that shoe. When I go like that, it comes.’ What’s wrong with you? Who are your parents? Shame on you, these women who walk around town doing that shit. It’s unbelievable… Bachelorette parties that take over every bar they go to, screaming. These bitches work in HR during the day, but at night… they’re just like, ‘Penis, penis, penis. Penis, penis, penis, penis.’ Who are your parents? Shame on you. You realize some little kid in China has to make those penis molds? Some little kid in China is pressing penises, penis sunglasses, so you can go out like, ‘Cocks, cocks on my head.’ You psycho. That’s where guys beat you. That’s, like, the one spot we beat you. We may be dumber than you, but we beat you there. We beat you by a landslide, because I have never been to a bachelor party where they’re like, ‘Santino, you ready to go? Put on your pussy costume. Let ‘s go.’ I put one on like… ‘Come on, let’ s go. ‘Get mine wet. Steve, get mine wet. ‘Get it wet. Get the clit wet. ‘Go. Get it wet. This is what we want.’ ‘Vaginer.’ We beat you. So we went and got married out of the country. We went to Costa Rica. We went down to Costa Rica. It was great. Central America, beautiful place. Costa Rica is amazing. We loved it. It was fantastic. I didn’t know that racism is everywhere. I had no idea, but it is, but it really fucking is. Here we are in our hotel, two men are in a fight with one man, two guys on one, two on one, working this dude, and I look out the window, and I’m like, ‘Oh, my God, what happened?’ To the local guy. And the local guy, who we know, who we’re buddies with, is like, ‘Oh, yeah, the fight?’ And I was like, ‘Yeah, what happened?’ I’m ready for the story. And he ‘s like,’ Okay, you see this guy on the ground? ‘You see him on the ground, ‘this guy who they kick in the face? ‘You see him? ‘You know, this guy on the ground they kick in the teeth. You see him?’ I was like, ‘Yeah, yeah, definitely. Yeah, what is that?’ And he goes, ‘Oh, yeah, this guy, this guy on the ground, he ‘s from Panama.’ What? ‘He’ s from Panama. Panama, the country. Panama.’ That’s it? That was as deep as the well got dug. ‘He’s from Panama.’ That’s it. I was like, ‘But how did the fight… Like, how did you… How did the fight happen?’ He goes, ‘Oh, sí, sí, sí, sí, sí, sí. ‘Okay, so this guy on the ground, ‘he cut off this guy in traffic, ‘and he says to him, ‘Hey, what the fuck?’ ‘And this guy, he says, ‘Hey, man, fuck you.’ ‘So this guy, he gets out of his car, ‘and he says, ‘Mm-mm, fuck you.’ ‘So then they yell at each other. ‘So this guy say fuck you. ‘This guy, fuck you. This guy, fuck… So both of these guys are fucking you right now.’ I was like, ‘No one’ s fucking me. What are you talking about?’ ‘And then his friend, he hear him from across the street, ‘and his friend, he says, ‘Hey, what happened?’ ‘He says, ‘He said, fuck you.’ ‘He says,’ Ah, fuck you.’ ‘He says, ‘Fuck you.’ ',\n",
              "  'He says. ‘Fuck you.’ He fuck… these guys over here are fucking you.’ ‘And the one guy, he says to him… ‘Before he fight with him, he says, ”Hey, motherfucker, where are you from?’ ‘And this guy, he says, ‘Panama.’ ‘And, uh… That ‘s it for him.’ Other than that, it was a beautiful country, man. It was gorgeous, man. We did so much white-people shit. It was unbelievable. You know what white-people shit is. Everybody in here knows it, right? It’s, like… We went zip-lining. It’s, like, white-water rafting, all that white-people… White-water rafting is white-people shit. It’s called white-water rafting. It’s ours. That’s some white-people shit. You’ll never, ever see a black guy white-water rafting, skydiving, drinking coffee. That’s just not what they do. It’s not what they do. Skydiving, all that shit. Black guy, do you go skydiving? Never in your fucking life, man. No way. Never in your life. Rock climbing? No way. White-water rafting? No. None of the above. Do you even like coffee? I do like coffee. Oh, come on, man. What did he say? I like it black. You like it black. I get that. I get that. You can have that. Take it black. Take it black. So he knows what I’m talking about. He knows. I went to college with… One of my closest friends in college was this dude we lived with, and he would always make fun of me. He ‘s like,’ You’re doing some white-people shit, Red. You on some white-people shit right now.’ I was like, ‘I’m taking out the trash.’ He’s like… ‘That’s the type of shit I’m talking about, motherfucker. ‘Just throw that shit outside, bitch. ‘White-people shit! ‘What you doing, dishes, motherfucker? You white-ass motherfucker.’ What you doing, laundry, you Charmin-ass motherfucker? You Charmin’… I did so much white-people shit in Costa Rica. It was bananas. I loved it, though. I love being a tourist. Like, that’s the fucked-up thing about Americans. We don’t want to be tourists. Why not? Why are we so afraid of being tourists? I’ll do that zip-line dork-ass shit. Give me the helmet. I love that. How much is the picture? $1,000? I don’t give a shit. I’ll pay for that, plan for it. Come on, man. Give me that dork tourist shit. We’re so afraid as Americans to be tourists. Yet for some reason, tourists come here. They’re not afraid to be tourists. You can go to Michigan Avenue right now. There’s a cute little Italian couple that’s like, ‘Mi scusi, mi scusi, mi scusi. The water tower, the water tower.’ And you ‘re like,’ Ah, come here. Let me lie to you. Come here, come here, come here.’ Let them be tourists, man. Be a tourist. Be a tourist. All I’m saying is, stop being such a liar. Be who you really are. You’re out of the country. Be out of the country, man. There’s nothing wrong with that, you know. Here’s why. Every time I’ve ever been to a Spanish-speaking country, there’s always one guy in the crew, one dude who’s like, ‘Hey, I got us. I can take us around. ‘I speak a little bit of Mexican. ‘We’ re gonna be good. We ‘ll be good.’ You speak Mexican, Brad? I speak Mexican, dog. I got us. Don’t sweat it, man. I took 101 in high school. We’re gonna be straight. And you’re like, ‘All right, man. I can’t wait.’ You walk into a restaurant. I say the truth. I walk in, I go, ‘Hello, American, americano, ‘American, ready to be ripped off. Look at me.’ ‘Cause I don’t give a shit. How much is that Coke? Seven? Thought it was ten. You can’t fuck me. You can’t fuck me. I planned for that. You cannot fuck me. But he walks in. Brad walks in, talking Mexican like, ‘Hola, seniors. Hola, seniors.’ He thinks he’s the shit. Brad walks in heavy, and the staff looks at him like, ‘Okay, okay, okay, okay. ¿Habla español, señor? ¿Habla español? ¿Habla español?’ Sí, sí, sen-yours. Sí, sí, sen-yours. Ha-blah a-spaniel. Ha-blah a-spaniel. Ha-blah a-spaniel. And they ‘re all like,’ Okay. ‘Hmm. Good, good, good. That’s good, good. That’s good.’ And they just machine-gun Spanish at his fuckin',\n",
              "  'g head until you see him go, ‘Oh, fuck. ‘There’s no bibliotecain there. Where’s the ban-yo? I don’t know any of those words.’ Brad looks like an asshole. Meanwhile, I’m enjoying my plate of rice and ‘polo,’ having a great time… enjoying my life. I came back from Costa Rica. It was fantastic, and then we got into that, like, all the marriage discussion shit. She was like, ‘What do you want to do about the last name?’ I was like, ‘I don’ t know. I mean, I don’t really care. I don’t think I really care.’ I was like, ‘I mean, what do you want to do?’ She’s like, ‘Well, do you want me to take your last name?’ And there’s a part of you that’s like, ‘No, man, it’s cool.’ Then there’s a part of you that’s like, ‘Yeah, you got to take the last name.’ It’s some male-ego bullshit, but that’s the truth of the situation. Like, it doesn’t really mean much. Like, what are last names anyway? I don’t really know. We don’t really know, you know. Last names… you used to give to somebody ’cause it represented land, right? You had some land. You get some land to give. Like, ‘This will all be yours one day.’ That doesn’t mean shit nowadays. I can’t be like, ‘Son, this condominium will be yours when I die.’ Who gives a shit, right? There’s not much to it. You know, it really doesn’t mean much. But it’s strange when I think about, like, white people’s last names, like, where our last names came from. A lot of times, it used to be your occupation, right? Like, I meet a guy… Kevin Blacksmith. His great-great-great-great- grandfather was a blacksmith. Dave Shoemaker, his great-great-great-great- grandfather was a shoemaker. But it’s weird when you meet a white guy named Eric Lynch… ‘Cause you’re like, ‘Your great-great-great-great- grandfather was a bad person.’ Switch it up, dog. But last names are kind of bullshit. You know know what I mean? They mean whatever they want and whatever you want them to mean, and so she said, ‘What do you want to do?’ I said, ‘How about we just go with whosever last name is cooler?’ Right, whosever’s is cooler. She was like, ‘Cooler?’ I was like, ‘Yeah,’ ’cause in my head, I knew it was already game over. I was like, ‘Jordan, buckets.’ I knew it was over. I knew it was over. She wasn’t fucking with Santino. What a cool-ass name, Santino. Three syllables… San, unh, ti, got you, oh. That’s what’s up. I had it. It was in the bag, man. It was in the bag. It was game over. Jordan. It was game over, but then she was like, ‘Oh, you think your last name is that much cooler?’ I said, ‘Yeah.’ Her last name was Eichelberger. You want me to say it again? Eichelberger. And she’s like, ‘What’s wrong with that?’ I was like, ‘What’ s right with that shit? What are you talking about, lady?’ She’s like, ‘It’s not that big of a deal.’ I said, ‘Well, it’s like part of the Third Reich.’ I’ll have to walk into restaurants, like… ‘We’ re here for the Eichelberger party, ‘the party of two. ‘There is two of us at the party. ‘We would like the table in the back of the room. ‘In the back of the room, ‘behind the air-conditioning, please. Thank you.’ Anyway, she’s a Santino now. Yeah. We got into a thing, ’cause I was… I feel like I’m watching too much porn lately, if I’m just being real with you guys. We’re getting real. It’s a late-night show. I was watching too much porn. Porn is bad. It’s a bad thing. It’s really addictive. It is. It truly is. I think it’s not my fault, though. I think it’s access… access, too much access. In your pockets, there’s a phone, right? In there is all the porno… All of it… all of it that we make. All of it that we make, you guys. If I had three seconds inside of a time machine, I would ‘zorb’ myself to when I was 14, for three seconds, and just go… ‘In the future, all the porno’s in your pocket,’. And get out… and blow my mind. Just… semen everywhere. Oh, my God. I’m waiting for this JPEG to load. Come on, man. That’s crazy. That is crazy to think about. It r',\n",
              "  'eally is too much access. Like, I can’t walk past a laptop without being like… ‘Ah, this is Best Buy. I got to go.’ The Blue Shirts, they don’t like that. You know what I mean? They get weird. We’ve seen so much of it. The problem is… With porn is, it’s got this stigma where we think we can emulate that stuff. Like, you think you’re like them. You’re not like them. Those are pros, man. Those are pros. I got envy. I have envy, envy. The way that these men throw a rope is remarkable. They just… It takes off. It’s got loft. Are you kidding me? I’m lucky if mine comes out. It’s like a pensive army. It gets to the surface, and it ‘s like,’ No, no. Go back, go back.’ And when it does come out, it’s late for the party. It has nonalcoholic beer. It’s like, ‘Sorry. We’re here.’ My wife… one night she was like, ‘Oh, come on my tits.’ I was like, ‘Oh, I’ll never make it up there.’ It’s so far. It’s too far. Maybe your belly button, max… if I really put in the work. I’ll tell you what I’ve been watching a lot of. I’ve been watching a lot of black porn, lots of black porn. Blackblack. Too. Like, chocolate, chocolate, chocolate, chocolate. Deep chocolate, 99% cacao chocolate. Sexy. No milk. Get out of here, milk chocolate. No time for you. Chocolate, chocolate. I love watching black porn, love watch… For one fundamental reason. The guys get to wear shoes… on their feet. Men wear shoes on their feet. If you know anything about how shoes and pants work, anything at all, you know that these men took off their shoes, took off their pants and underwear, and then put back on their shoes. Come on. You did it again, black people. Numero uno. I got the envy, man. It’s a bad thing. It really is. It’s a bad thing. We need to clean up our minds, clean up our life. You know what I mean? Get clean, clean living. Eat a smoothie, take a walk. It’s difficult, man. It’s difficult to do. People always… like, listen, I try to work out. I’m trying to be in shape. I’m trying to do all that stuff. It’s a hard thing to do. You know, fast food, going to get fast food always reminds me of what it was like when I was single, going to a one-night stand. It was like the same thing, like the exact same feeling. You’ll be looking on Google Maps to try to find out if that fast-food joint’s open, right? You’re like, ‘You up, McDonald’s? You up?’ You send a late-night text, like, ‘What’ s up, girl? ‘You up? What’s up, McDonald’s? ‘You up? What’s up, Mac D’s? Is you up, playboy? Give me them nuggets.’ She’s like, ‘Uh-huh.’ McDonald’s is like, ‘You know it.’ You cruise over there, and on the way, you’re like, ‘Ooh, it’ s gonna be good. ‘I know what I get at this location. ‘This is my favorite spot to go to at this time of night. That number two is my spot right now.’ That’s a butt joke. You get over there, and you eat that. You devour that McDiesel’s. Just like that, you’re like… Devour it. And when you’re done, you get in the car and cruise home… Same feeling. Cruising home, and you’re like… ‘I’m a bad person, man.’ Sad. I had to cut that out. I had to cut it out, man. I’m trying to stay healthy. I’m trying to fit into my own skin. That’s really what it is. You know, I’m trying to feel good about myself. It’s a confidence thing about people. You want to feel confident and cocky, but, like, not too much. Like, I had my ego tested. I got into a car accident. A man hit me. A man hit me. I was at a red light. A man hit me, okay? Red light, skrrr, man, bmm-bmm-bmm, hit me, and I got out of my car. He got out of his car, and I went to say something. Before I could say anything, he goes, ‘Hey, what the fuck?’ And I said… ‘That’ s my line. ‘I say that. That’s me. ‘I’m doing… That’s what I do. You say, ‘I’m sorry,’ I feel like.’ He was a big-ass dude. He was big, jacked up, and he had tattoos up to his face? Question mark. You good, bro? On your face? You cashed out? You got cancer? What’s up? On your face? I feel like that’',\n",
              "  's some, like, ‘I don’t give a… ‘Whatever, bro. Go ahead. It’s done. ‘I don’ t give a shit. ‘I’ ve been collecting Marlboro miles for years. I ‘ll cash out.’ On your face? So I had no way to win this war. This dude was in my face. I had no… I was backed up. I was like, ‘Whatever, man.’ And in that moment, I was like, ‘I can’ t win this argument with this dude. I can ‘t beat him physically.’ But I was like, ‘If I had a superpower right now, ‘you know, it wouldn’ t be to, like, fly or be invisible. I would love to be able to throw acne on somebody.’ Right? He’s all, ‘Fuck you.’ I’m like, ‘Fuck me? Fuck you, man.’ No! Hit him all over the body, shoulder, bacne. Hit him with the bacne. Hit him with the kn-acne, that knee acne. Light him up, light him up. Scar him physically and emotionally, send him home like that for a couple of weeks, depending on the topical cream. Let it sit. Let it sit. If you’re not laughing at that, you didn’t have acne when you were a kid. I had really bad acne when I was a kid, man. It was so bad. It was so bad. Like, acne is, like, the sole reason I questioned God. I’m like, ‘What up, dude? What’s the deal? ‘Where are you at on this one, player? This is ridiculous.’ Here you are, 13, 14 years old. You’re the ugliest version of yourself. Look at photos of you at 14. TBT them on Instagram, and you’re like, ‘Ooh, tough-looking kid.’ You’re ugly, bro. You are ugly at 14. Teenagers are so gross to look at, hard to see. They’re hard to see, bro. They’re skinny. Their voices are crackling. They’re wobbling all over like little skinny baby giraffes, just hungry and horny like… Nasty-looking crea… They look like Tim Burton cartoons. They’re barely alive. You are nasty as a child. And you’re telling me at this vulnerable point in your life, God is gonna be like, ‘You know what? ‘I’ m gonna put some red pus bumps on his face. Pus bump his face up.’ I didn’t get it. I didn’t understand it. I had it so bad. I had to go on Accutane. You used to have to sign a form that said. ‘I can die from this medication.’ What’s up, guys? What are we saying? I can die from this medi… I can die from this medication. And I was underage, so I had a legal guardian. So my mother had to sign it. I was 16. I’ll never forget. They slipped the sheet to my mother, and she looked at it, and then she looked at me. Yeah. Yeah, this is… it’s… it’s better than your face. It doesn’t really matter. You’re an ugly kid. You’re ugly. It’s… it’s for you. I had it so bad. I had acne so bad when I was young. When I was in high school, I played basketball for a couple years at my high school until I found out about drugs, and I was like, ‘See you later, basketball.’ Ah, true story. But I played basketball for a little while. When I played basketball, I made the JV team pretty early on, and we played in a summer league, okay? In the summer league, you had to play all the other schools that you were going to play in that regular season, and I’ll never forget. We went out to West Aurora to go play these guys, and they were supposed to beat us. They were, like, a really good school, right? They were really good. They were an all-black school. We were a some-black school. They were gonna beat us. Bottom line, they were gonna win. And we went out there, and we beat the shit out of these guys. I had the game of my life. I dropped four points. I was on fire. If you know anything about high-school basketball, four points is like, whoa. What are you, MVP? Final score, 12-2. It was a blowout. I mean, we went out there. I had a great game. I was on cloud nine. I felt like a king. Then I left, and I went out to the hallway to go get a drink of water. I’m getting a drink of water, bending down by the water fountain to have a drink of water. A little black kid, like, eight years old walks in the hallway. Comes up to me and goes, ‘Hey, yo, white boy. White boy.’ I go, ‘What’s up?’ You’re pretty good, man. Oh, tha',\n",
              "  'nks, man. He goes, ‘For a white boy.’ And I was still like, ‘Thank you. I appreciate that.’ I’ll take it. Then he goes, ‘All right, man.’ I go, ‘All right, man.’ He walks away. Felt good. Go down to get some more water. He gets to the doorway. He stops… real Forest Whitaker-style. He turns around and goes, ‘Hey, yo, white boy.’ I say, ‘What’s up, man? What up?’ He goes, ‘What the fuck is all over your face?’ That still hurts today. I’m in my 30s. That cut went all the way to the bone. You know what I mean? Then I walked up to him slowly, and I said, ‘Well, this is what happens when your dad sticks around.’ No, I didn’t say that. That’s a joke, man. No, I called him the N word. Then I got out of there as fast as I could. No, stop it. I cried on the bus, man. I cried on the bus. Got to have a sense of humor, man. But I always loved black people. I always did. I really did. I still do. I still do love black people, man. I think they’re fantastic human beings. Black people always accepted me. Black people really did. White people never liked me. White people don’t like redheads for some reason. There’s this thing. White people see redheads, and they’re like, ‘What do we do with it?’ They don’t like us. They don’t trust us. They make a day to kick us. Call us names… ‘You fire crotch, you ginger.’ They ask us stupid questions, like does the carpet match the drapes? A black guy’s never said that to me. White guys… ‘The carpet match the drapes, bud?’ And I’m always like, ‘Are you a grown-up asking ‘about my penis hair? ‘Is that the level that you’re on? ‘You’ re worried about my penis hair, dude. ‘If you must know, it’s hardwood floors. There ‘s no carpet there, bro.’ I clean it up. Go get you a little buzzer from Target and clean that shit up. You get under there. It’s like… It’s working overtime under there. That’s the no-fly zone, no-fly zone. It might die under there, like… I can’t, I can’t. White people never liked me. They never did. They always made fun of me. That’s a reality check. Now people are like, ‘Huh? What are you talking about?’ White people always made fun of redheads. Redheads are this outcast. We’re this weird minority for some reason, but black people always liked me. They really did. They took to me. Like, black people like white people with a deficiency. I’m like a dog with one bad leg. You know, white people don’t adopt that dog, but black people are like, ‘No, no, no. ‘He good, he good, he good. ‘He gonna be fine. Come here, Tripod. ‘He gonna be fine. Tripod. ‘Come here, Tripod. It gonna work out.’ That’s just the truth. It just made me feel normal when I was a kid. So I loved hip-hop culture. I loved everything all my black friends liked, so much so that in the ’90s, people used to say this word. People used to call me a ‘wigger.’ Do you remember that word? Don’t get uncomfortable. You all said it. You all said it. I don’t know why we got rid of it. It was hilarious. You should’ve stuck around for a while. People used to call me a ‘wigger.’ People used to say ‘wigger’ to me ’cause they thought it would hurt my feelings. They thought, like, that was a way to get my goat. You know what I mean? And I’ll never forget. I was on a basketball court the first time I heard it, and we had won this basketball game, and this dude from the losing team says… ‘Whatever, bro. That dude ain’t nothing but a wigger.’ And all my black friends heard it, and they were disappointed. They heard him say that, and they were like… That’s how they sound, like a train. They were like… When black guys are bummed out, it sounds like a train, just… Next stop, Sedgwick. But they were bummed out ’cause that was an attack, you know. They didn’t like that, but when I heard it, I heard it different, ’cause they were like, ‘That white dude ain’t nothing but a wigger.’ And I heard it, and I was like, ‘Oh… so close.’ How do I get that N? How do I get that N? These are Karl Kani jeans. This',\n",
              "  ' is a Perry Ellis shirt. Give it to me. I bought Timberland boots. Say it if you’re gonna say it, you racist motherfuckers. Say it. How do I get that, man? It was just me being real. That’s all that was. I wanted to be a black guy. I thought I was black. I thought I was a black guy. Even to this day, I still have a lot of black friends, and I got to tell you… Every time I talk to my black guy friends, I’m always like, ‘Hey, man, don’t date white girls.’ Don’t date white girls. Not ’cause I’m racist. I’m clearly not racist. I have black friends. I’m not a racist. I tell my black guy friends to not date white girls ’cause I genuinely care about the future of sports. That’s it. We don’t need any placekickers and long snappers. We want dunk contests, right? How do you get a Heisman? You know what I mean? Not from Jerome and Cassie. Jerome and Jaquanda… That’s how we’re gonna make a Heisman, two beautiful chocolate people making love under a beautiful chocolate rain shower while he’s got shoes on. We know the formula. We know the formula. Drake is the number-one dude in hip-hop. His name is Aubrey. Yeah! We let him get away with that. Drake’s name is Aubrey, and nobody said shit about it. Aubrey, number one in hip-hop. What’s his name, Aubrey? Got it. Okay, cool. We’re good. He had beef with Meek Mill. It was a big beef. You’re it. Tag, you’re it. You’re it. Tag. Remember real beef? You remember when hip-hop was, like, real beef? People hated each other. Tupac and Biggie hated each other so much, and they were best friends at one point. They had real beef so deep that Tupac started a song called ‘Hit ‘Em Up’… Before he started the lyrics, he goes, ‘So I fucked your bitch, you fat motherfucker.’ That’s what he said. You’re fat. Fucked your girlfriend. Okay, let’s go. Here we go. That’s crazy. That’s how much he hated that guy. That’s real beef. I feel like hip-hop has, like, dissipated, you know. It’s just, like, gone by the wayside, and I blame one person for the death of hip-hop. His name is Macklemore. That dude is the worst. That dude is the worst. Macklemore is at fault for all this shit going south. Macklemore is not hip-hop. You can like him, but he’s not hip-hop, okay? That’s pop. He talks about going downtown on a scooter with his pals. Come on, bro. What? You’re gonna go downtown with your buddies on a scooter, Macklemore? That’s not hip-hop. Hip-hop doesn’t go downtown. Hip-hop lives downtown, and it goes to the suburbs and robs those people and comes back downtown. It doesn’t go downtown. Talking about thrift stores. Fuck you, bro. Don’t fucking talk about discount clothing! No! I don’t want to hear that, man. I want to hear a rapper be like… And I’m like, ‘You got it, you got it.’ That’s what I want to hear, man. I want to hear Rick Ross be like… That’s what I want to hear. Get out of here, Macklemore. What’s wrong with you, bro? This guy’s bullshit. We can’t call him hip-hop. It’s crazy that he’s hip-hop, ’cause it’s not. It’s all some sensitive-ass shit. The thing that made me the most mad about Macklemore is he co-wrote this song he got a Grammy nomination for that arguably made him famous, right? It made him famous, right? It was called ‘Same Love.’ It was about same-sex marriage. Now, the song and the depth of the song I’m not against. I’m for same-sex marriage. I don’t give a shit who you want to marry, okay? You want to marry who you want to marry? Go crazy, man. You don’t fuck kids or animals, I don’t care. That’s it for me. No kids, no animals, we’re straight. You want to marry your toaster? Go crazy. Just don’t return that. I don’t want to buy that fucked toaster. So the song I’m okay with. It’s at the beginning of the song, the intro. He goes, ‘When I was in the third grade, I thought that I was gay.’ Remember this bullshit? I thought that I was gay. When I was in the third grade, I thought I was a gay person. That’s what he said. I thought I was one',\n",
              "  ' of you fellas. Thank God I’m not. I’m not, but I thought I was. I thought so. I hated that. I hated that ’cause they applauded him. They were like, ‘Oh, how bold. ‘How brave of Macklemore. ‘He thought he was a homosexual. ‘In third grade, he thought he was a homosexual. ‘He’ s not, which is good, but he thought he was. He thought he was a gay.’ And they thought that was, like, a risky thing to say… ‘I thought I was gay when I was in third grade.’ I hate that shit. You remember third grade? I do. Everybody was gay. Everybody in here in third grade was gay. You were all gay. I wore sweat pants. I played the recorder. I was very gay. I used to Rollerblade around my neighborhood, like, ‘Hey, fellas.’ I would fag out all day. Like… I was homosexual, bro. It wasn’t a question. It was a fact. That kid’s gay as shit. Little redhead gay kid skating backwards. I was gay, man. I was gay when I was in third grade. You were all gay in third grade. I would beg my mom to let me sleep at other boys’ houses every night of the week. I want to sleep at Billy’s. What are you doing over there? None of your business, Mom! Make the call, please! I was so gay in third grade. If another boy accused me of liking girls, I’d fucking murder that kid. Chicago, Illinois, I got to go. I’m Andrew Santino. Thank you so much, man. Thank you, guys. I love you, Chicago. Everybody who’s anybody has lived in this building, man. Locals, baby… Jordan, Pippen, Longley, Kerr, Paxton. You know it, dude. Ryne Sandberg used to own and live in one of those big white poles at the top. He would have to slide down for breakfast. Al Capone still lives in the basement. Not dead. It’s now called Willis, used to be called Macy’s Tower, after the Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade, because most of the floats are made right here in this building. It’s actually anatomically to scale… even his balls. The penis is not. They ran out of clay, but the balls are full. And if you look right beyond me, that’s the Adams Street Bridge, named, of course, after the Addams Family. Duh-na-na-na. Oh, you want a fat dick in a bun or a little dick in a bun? I don’t want any penises on the hot dog, just a regular hot dog. Okay, we’re gonna give you a Trump dog, then. Gonna give me a Trump dog? Damn right. You know what? Let me tell you something. You’re not nice, and you’re not nice to people and… We don’t give a fuck about your fucking soft ass. Yes. I’m sick of this abuse. All I want is… Save that pussy-ass shit for somebody else that want to fucking hear it. Good night, pussy lips. Right. Fine, good night. Bye, dick cheese. Get the fuck out of here. I’m leaving. Pussy nose. Well, leave. Tweet, tweety bird. Hey, Andrew, I think the crew’s gonna head out of here. Cool, man. Get out. We’re wrapped. Yeah, I’m here. Do you need a ride, or are you good?

She also shares her thoughts on the societal expectations placed on women and how she has navigated them throughout her life. * * * ♪ So I started to speak freely ♪ ♪ Figured it would lead me to war or a peace treaty ♪ ♪ And knew no matter what, end up with a deep sleep ♪ ♪ And the habits of a soul who knows what it’s seeking ♪ ♪ You’re thinking it’s a joke, but it’s not folks ♪ ♪ It’s all in the delivery ♪ Thank you. Thank you guys. Thank you for coming out. It is good to be here in Minneapolis, thank you. Whenever I’m on tour, I have to prepare to be gone for awhile. And so I was at the pharmacy, I was picking up my prescription for acne. I love my acne, keeps me young. I’m on antibiotics, they’re working. I’ve been on them for seven years, which I heard is good for you. Before that, I was on spironolactone, any spiro heads here? Are you really on it? Did it make you pee a lot? Yes, and it made me faint. What? Did it thin your hair at all? No. Okay, we can, we’ll talk more later. It did, it made me pee a lot, it thinned my hair out, it made my boobs hurt really bad. I grew very alarmed and I chose to do nothing. I just waited for the follow-up appointment with the doctor and he said, “Oh yeah, I should have told you, “it’s going to make your boobs,” he actually said titties, he was like, “It’s going to make your titties more sensitive.” I thought, that would have been nice to know. I’ve been slowly saying goodbye to my family. So I’m at the pharmacy, you can’t help, but pick up other things, they designed it that way. And Easter is my favorite season of candy. Now, thankfully they have Peeps pretty much year-round. So I picked up some, who knows, Flag Day peeps. I don’t look at the shape before, I barely taste when I eat. And I also picked up a bunch of condoms ’cause I’m the breadwinner of most of my relationships. And I’m also not on birth control because sometimes birth control is like, I know you’re hungry, but what if you cried? So I don’t do that. And as I’m checking out the man at the pharmacy, he slides my prescription and I sign for it. He slides the Peeps and then he goes to slide the condoms and for some reason out loud to him, I say, “These aren’t for me.” I’m a grown woman in my sixties, like I’m very open about s',\n",
              "  'ex, all of a sudden a man, I don’t know, touches a box of condoms, and I’m like these, I would never, I got back to my car and I turned inward. I was like, what happened back there, man? You got weird. I don’t know, I guess if you’re a dude buying condoms, maybe you feel cool. ‘Cause like you’re gonna get laid or whatever. I don’t know how you feel. Do you, or, he’s like I don’t wear condoms, because I don’t get pregnant. That always cracks me up, wen the dude chimes in with like, she trapped me with a baby. Impossible. You have the missing ingredient and we love to bake. if I had all the ingredients for a cake except for the sugar, and then you, what’s your name? Jeremy. Jeremy brought over the sugar, we’d be like this cake wouldn’t be possible without Jeremy. thank you so much for this cake, Jeremy. Jeremy, Jeremy, Jeremy. That’s right. What I’m saying is men are garbage, but But, women are the can, okay. So we’re in it together. Sometimes you have to flip us over and shake us for us to let go of garbage. But I think what it boils down to in my personal opinion, I think dudes, you’re just, you’re more in touch with your personal pleasure from a very early age. Late elementary, early junior high, the boys I grew up with in Ohio were just constantly talking about jerking off or jerking off or doing this motion, which I added to my vocabulary far too soon. I had no clue what it meant. I would just be like, okay, mom, take a gamble. I was punished. It’s so high. What are we doing with it up here? Everybody knows, it’s like… vi-vi-vi-vi… Like who are you jerking off that’s shoulder height. That’s question one from me. Then sex ed happened in junior high. I remember our health teacher saying I taught my sons how to masturbate. I was like, is that legal? I thought we were hiding it. But young girls have sex organs, too. Even though some of us don’t look down until we’re 23. But as a kid, I was secretly humping all kinds of stuff around the house. I was humping the couch, I was humping the bannister, with a pillow after this splinter incident. I was humping the edge of the bathtub. I remember one year my mom wanted to move and I said, we can’t. My girlfriends live here. Can you imagine if we taught our daughters to masturbate? My mom could’ve kept decorative pillows about, instead it took like the strength of three of my closest girlfriends when we turned 18 to even go to a sex store. Meanwhile, I feel like into adulthood, dudes, you can just hop in your car, drive somewhere, get fully jerked off. I was a little vague. In my head, I was thinking like a rub and tug scenario or a happy ending situation. You know what I’m talking about? He was like, yes, that’s how we met. Have any women here been offered a happy ending? Just an angry silence. It’s more of a man’s game, the happy ending. I guess it’s what we look at as like your complete and total relaxation, either that or we look at your semen as poison and',\n",
              "  ' we’re like, get it out of them so they don’t hurt anybody. I think it’s a positive thing, as long as nobody’s freaking trapped in a room. And of course whether you know it or not, there’s tons of sex workers all around us. The problem is whenever I get a massage, I just assume that the massage therapist is falling in love with me. Do you do that, I’m like we’re not talking, but I’m pretty sure he’s impressed with my back. And maybe my shoulders would drop two inches if somebody just offered to like, just a little bit. But no, for a lot of reasons, a lot of liabilities, the main one being that massage therapists are not sex workers. That’s the big one. It got conflated along the way. I don’t know why, maybe because people were already naked. I feel like if somebody started offering hand jobs at the pool, lifeguards would probably suffer the same plight. They’re just like trying to save somebody and the person’s like, yeah, choke me. And I’m like, what the fuck? I don’t think that the female orgasm is as equated with relaxation and release. I think it’s because everyone assumes women relax by like curling up on a couch at night, underneath a quilt that we made, just warming ourselves by a fire, while we pet our cat, and sip Celestial Seasonings tea like mmm, mmm, mmm. I’ve never orgasmed that way. Not once, it would take so much from the cat and its little paw. And then after an hour I’d be like, get off of me. I’ll do it myself. I have a good amount of guy friends that genuinely believe that they like sex more than women. And I love orgasming. There’s not a woman in here who doesn’t love orgasming. It’s the sex that’s the problem. Now, look, I assume every man in here tonight is just so good at fucking, so I’m not talking about anybody in here. The problem is outside and we just have to take what we talk about here tonight and help them. I try to have healthy conversations about these things. I did a podcast recently in exchange for some tap water and two new fans. The podcast, it was hosted by a male comedian and he wanted to talk about the Me Too movement because you gotta if you have a lady on the pod. And his hot take was sort of the Me Too movement, well, what are we supposed to do now? I was like, what were you doing before? I guess keep doing or stop doing that. Now we were doing shows together all weekend and I was the only comic on the shows who agreed to do his podcast. So I decided to take it as an opportunity to confront him about one of his jokes that I didn’t love and this podcast was never released . We don’t like to be challenged. But he had a joke that he was performing that went like I used to fuck chicks all the time after shows. Which is true. When a male comic’s up here, it’s very attractive to women, a sense of humor, and he has an hour window after the show to capitalize on that before the girl finds out like, oh my God, he’s so sad. So his joke was like, I used to fuck chicks ',\n",
              "  'all the time after shows. Now, if I want to fuck a chick and she likes it rough, I’m going to need paperwork to fuck. Insinuating that if she were also into rough sex, she would then later lie and use it to accuse him of, what’s it called when somebody wants to have sex with you, but you don’t, and they do it anyway? Rape. Thank you, it’s so much easier when somebody else brings it up. People do not like hearing a woman comic say that word. I guess because the dudes are like, hey, that’s our thing. I think paperwork’s a good idea. I’m for it. I am pro paperwork. Just to be clear, I think it’s interesting he decided to live in a profession that’s been relegated to women for the last hundred years like he’d probably need me to like draw up the paperwork for him. In which case, I could put a clause in there that says not bringing the female to climax is punishable by law. Or something, I don’t know, I’m spitballing. And then maybe a clause in there for him that says like the safe word is stop. Give that a whirl. It just bothered me that night after night, he was performing these jokes for crowds full of people just like you. Well, we were in Vegas, like nothing like you. Just scaring roomfuls of dudes about having post-Me Too sex, when most of you guys are doing it right. There’s probably only like one rapist in here. I don’t know, maybe two, look around, they’re not laughing. Are you sitting here as a heterosexual man, and you don’t know how to touch a woman, like get up here. I’ll show you, I’m just kidding. I feel like, do you know how to pet a cat? How about that? If you’re scared during these times and you’re alone with a woman, just pretend that it’s a cat. That’s my advice for you. Just wait for it to come up to you. It might take a while. Let it smell you before you pet it. And if it’s all curled up sleeping, don’t pick it up. It doesn’t like that. And then if the cat comes up to you and starts rubbing its face on your face, hard, sometimes shockingly hard, then you can ask yourself, like, is this cat trying to fuck? And then yes, go ahead and fuck that cat. You guys seem cool. Maybe I was wrong and I was just overly worried for you guys. I just didn’t like that he would be scaring you, but maybe you’re not scared at all, and it’s just like a handful of celebrities and some very vocal comics that are scared, scared of getting accused of rape. For some reason, it’s easier to hear in a Scottish accent. I don’t know, I don’t know why they’re scared. They’re going to get away with it. If they go through this system is what I’m saying. I was watching a famous colleague of mine yell into a microphone and he was like, so you know there’s no due process, it’s fricking crazy. A woman makes a claim and people just believe her without going through the legal system. I’m like, ah, the legal system, or as I like to call it, the white man’s FUBU… just For Us By Us. It’s their safe space really. It’s why they ',\n",
              "  'have a checklist of things they like you to go down after you’ve been raped. Number one: did you go to the cops? It’s like me personally, I would rather talk to Ice T’s character of a cop than a real cop if I got raped, because at least Ice T would listen and then say something like, that’s messed up. And then when he got back to the precinct, he’d probably fire something off like gotta be Mrs. Butterworth in order to make a rape charge stick. Two: they’re always like, did you go to the hospital? It’s like, do you guys remember at the beginning, when I thought I had breast cancer and I just waited it out. If I got raped, I don’t want to run an errand, okay. And three: they really don’t want you to use social media about it, ’cause then other people might come forward and something might get done. So they sort of villainize you and call you like a social justice or a hashtag warrior. And it’s like, do you guys think that Tarana Burke wanted to start the Me Too movement on Twitter? The same website people use to talk about their Taco Bell diarrhea? I’m thinking no, but her options were limited. And then there will always be somebody who says, women make these claims for attention. And I’m just like, who would want that attention? Like, what are the benefits? Are you imagining these women going to job interviews and saying things like, as you can see on my resume, not only have I been raped, I’ve also been doxed. And I think you’ll find that I work best in groups rather than one-on-one. And I’m willing to work 24-7 because frankly, I’m terrified to be alone in my apartment. And that’s just a job interview for Taco Bell. So you can imagine, I just, I can’t think of like a celebrity accuser. The only one that comes to mind, I guess, is Lorena Bobbitt, but she didn’t do that for attention. She just got famous for disarming her assailant. I don’t know, maybe arm is generous. Still, if I could choose a superpower, it would be penis 100%. I’m so jealous of your dicks. I want one to have and to hold, but like also on my person, I feel like it’s easier to pee. You can pee anywhere, shape, line, you can spell your name, Jeremy. Is it a Y there at the end? Really let her rip. I also think it’s easier to receive pleasure from a stranger. Like anybody can figure it out. It’s like up down. I think it’s cause your penises are outside of you. Right, you know what I mean. He’s like my dick is out right now. But for me, more of an indoor situation, our bodies are like homes. Some of us more an Airbnb, but we can be, we can be entered. We can be entered. That’s why it’s important to knock or bring a gift. Just because you’ve come over once doesn’t mean you get keys, crazy. But dudes, you have like a fun, quick name for pleasure on the go, it’s blowjob. And then sometimes you shorten that to BJ or like beej. But for me it’s like, can I interest you in performing cunnilingus? It sounds scientific. Even our fun word for it,',\n",
              "  ' going down, has a negative connotation. It’s like going down to hell. It’s a little hot down there, but hypothetically, any person in here with a penis could just walk back to the bathrooms, get a quick beej to compleesh, but me, I have to walk back to the bathrooms, make sure that there’s a koala care station. Pull it down. Hoist my body up onto it. Get these overalls off. Buckle myself in, in case it’s good. And then fingers crossed that I showered. No, but truly like if you had a long day at work and then you found out you were going to get intimate with somebody and you didn’t feel fresh, you could just slip away to the bathroom and wash your dick off in the sink. And I hope you do. But for me it’s like, have you ever tried to gut a pumpkin? There’s a lot of seeds. Is my hand better or a spoon? We can’t be sure it’s clean until we get a candle in here. You’re not going to find me pants-less on the Koala Care. I promise. Frankly, it won’t hold me. I’m definitely more of a relationship person. Like I’m willing to be unhappy with someone for up to three years. I’ve also never been dumped, I’m undefeated. Thank you, oh thank you so much. I tend to go relationship to relationship. I think a professional would call that codependent. I call it college educated, okay. I don’t quit a job before I have another one lined up. My last relationship was very on again, off again. I would break up with him, but it wouldn’t stick. He would convince me that we were soulmates and then later complained you’re always trying to change me. I’m like, yes, exactly. You won’t let me go, I’m making do with what I have. He did have a big penis, he wanted me to tell you guys that. I’m sure he still has it. Everybody acts like that’s a good thing. It always gave me anxiety, especially before sex. I always felt like I was prepping myself for minor outpatient surgery. Just in the way that he’d always say, now you’re going to feel a little bit of light pressure. And then it was over. He’d be like count back from 100, I never got into the eighties. And then afterwards he’d be standing over me like you lost a lot of fluid. I’m like, that was you. He would always go down on me, which you should all be doing, before sex, but he would just go down on me and then he would drool a lot all over my hoot and then look up and say, whoa, you’re so wet. That would be like if I lit the kitchen on fire and then yelled, dinner’s ready. You cannot unlock a lock by just dousing it in WD-40. There’s a key. Sometimes there’s a code. I’m not saying I’m amazing in bed. Like sure, I’ve gotten my 10,000 hours in and I hate to brag, but I can last forever in bed without coming. Hours, weeks, I’ve gone a year. I didn’t even have to think about dead animals or baseball, like I was trying. So I’ve turned to dating younger men, I’m a bit of a coug. Thank you. I like sleeping with younger men because you can use tactics on them in bed that you know work on y',\n",
              "  'ounger people. For example, you can be like, let’s see how fast you can do it, I’ll time you. Last one to come’s a rotten egg. I’m kidding, it’s me. All my eggs are rotten, I’m 63. I’ve been dating a guy who’s nine years younger than me. And, when we first started dating, I had like high school feelings for him. And I couldn’t tell whether it was ’cause he was the one or just so recently out of high school. He’s of age, to be clear. I don’t want to creep anybody out. I feel like I’m teaching him a lot about life, love, sober sex. I’m raising a wonderful young man. And he’s teaching me stuff too about memes, it’s mostly memes. I’m haha, he’s more LOL. There’s an age gap. If you are sitting here as a relationship person, you have to be careful because, you know, you end a relationship with this high level of intimacy and when you meet someone new, you have to start over. But it’s very tempting to pick up right where you left off because you can hit it off with a stranger immediately. And you can’t always tell whether it’s passion, or alcoholism, or mental illness. Sometimes it takes a bit for that to roll out. I was once dating this con artist. He would prefer artist. Three months into our relationship, I actually caught him eating one of his boogers. Now, in his defense, there was still like a little bit of cocaine left in it, but it’s a bad sign, you know, when you wish your boyfriend just ate regular boogs. This is sort of when I wish women would talk more, you know, like give each other the review. We keep very separate and that’s where their strength lies. I was warned once, she was just too late, and a woman came up to me after a show and she said, hey, we need to talk. And I thought ruh-roh. She said, I also dated that con artist after you and a little bit during. And she said, he gave me chlamydia. So you might want to go get checked. And then I went and I got checked and I didn’t have it. So I didn’t need to tell you guys any of that. I think my point was I don’t know why I was drawn to this person. Like I barely drink, I’ll have a beer. I’ll take a little toot on the weed horn, absolutely. But hard drugs scare me. Like the closest I’ve come to doing cocaine is just trying to pet a guinea pig in a cage. Have you ever done that? Oh my God, they’re in there, they’re running around, they’re kicking up chips. It’s like, what a rush. Try to get your hand in and out of there without freaking out. Your heart’s gonna race, I guarantee it. Separately, I dated a Russian DJ, naturally, and he had just told me that he was going to stop doing cocaine for me, which meant he was going to stop telling me when he did cocaine. This is one of those like hit it off immediately situations, we’re very into each other and it’s like our fourth date, but I’m trying to keep it light and not latch on too soon. And he looks at me across the table and he says, I haven’t felt this way about a woman in six years. And all I ',\n",
              "  'could think was just, who is she? All I need is an Instagram handle, so I can go to her Etsy store and order one of her items and leave a cryptic review I love women. I hate what we do in review sections. I do a lot of online shopping to feel whole and I order many, many items. All of which I send back and I read a ton of reviews ’cause I’m very careful when I waste my time. And I will be on bloomingdales.com, looking at some inordinately expensive T-shirt where a woman has written a review that says I’m five-foot-one, 90 pounds, and swimming in a small. It’s like we get it. You’ve never broken a chair. Just say it runs large, okay. We don’t need your stats, Nina. So after this woman called me fat on the internet, I retaliated and I wrote my own review of the same t-shirt without having purchased it. And my review, I wrote I’m five-foot-nine I graduated magna cum laude. I have a really big one bedroom and I don’t weigh myself, post. 43 people found that helpful. I don’t, I don’t weigh myself. I just ask someone to draw me. And if they reach for a jumbo Sharpie, maybe I dial it back a bit. If I feel like it, I like fluctuating. It keeps it fun, keeps it fresh. I heard it’s good for your heart. I used to weigh myself when I was chubbier, when I was working in the bagel industry. I was in quality control. And when I worked at the bagel shop, I ate too much, too many times, to the point where you could see it on my body. Food is interesting like that, you show your work. I put up some of my best numbers at the bagel shop. It was during a time in my life where I thought that cookies might go extinct. My top score was 198 pounds, which, I’m 5-9 as I mentioned, it’s kind of nothing on my frame. You know, 198 is not a wake-up call. That’s a challenge. You’re going to get two pounds away from 200 and not hit it. Go fuck yourself. I did it the next day. No matter what the scale says, I always feel good about myself. I have like reverse body dysmorphia or something. ‘Cause if you don’t know, regular body dysmorphia, it’s when you think you’re fat, but you’re actually stupid. No, there’s other reasons like mothers and being brainwashed by doctored images of other women. since the time we could see. That one’s a little dark, but I keep it in. I guess I wouldn’t have to make jokes about this stuff if women’s worth, weren’t still based on our looks but for some reason it is. Some people know that and they think the highest compliment that they can pay a woman is like, hey, I noticed that you lost weight and you look amazing. And that just fills us up because we are so hungry. And if you think about it, all you’re really saying is like, hey, I noticed that you take up less space and I like it. And we’re like, thank you. Someday, I hope to not even be here. I wish I didn’t remember every negative thing somebody said to me about my body. But it’s the stuff people say to you about your appearance that you remember. If ',\n",
              "  'nobody said anything, I would have been fine. Can’t see how big your ass is when you’re trucking straight ahead. I was dating a guy for a while and we went out to eat and we finished the meal. And then I decided to order a cinnamon roll to go, just to feel safe, and he looked at me and he said, I love you, but I don’t think you need that cinnamon roll. For free, nobody there to him to say it. So when we got back to my apartment, he asked, are you mad at me? And I said, yes. And he explained, I was just worried about your health. Now to give it context, he and I had had discussions about how sometimes people who’ve been through trauma have an emotional attachment to food. And that’s true for me. Sometimes being full feels like a hug from the inside. So while I appreciate his concern, I’d only gain 10 or 15 pounds and you can’t die from a muffin top. Now here’s where he tripped into a light jog out of my life. He decided to add, “It’s just that my therapist told me that I could tell you that I was more attracted to you when you were exercising and eating better.” And I thought, is your therapist your friend Sean? ‘Cause it sounds like Sean, who also called me crazy for making you wash your hands before sex after riding the subway, but I feel like every surgeon has to scrub in, okay. This was all coming from a very thin person and I never asked him to eat more so it didn’t feel like I was trying to snuggle with a jungle gym, or get fucked by a rhombus. That’s a lot of sharp angles coming at me. Whatever, everybody’s health goals are different. Some people’s health goals are just being able to tell what the diarrhea was from. I think we’re finally in a good place where everybody realizes that being fat doesn’t mean you’re unhealthy and being thin doesn’t mean you’re healthy. When I was 200 pounds, I lived with a girl who was a hundred pounds and she would always call herself fat. She was a German shepherd, but like she carried it well. It affects everybody. I know it affects men too. Of course you guys aren’t immune to body image issues, or maybe you have events in mind you’d like to look good for. I remember my sister got married during my bagel years and I made the mistake of comparing myself to one of the other bridesmaids online, which you never want to do, you know it, don’t compare yourself to other people. But I remember thinking I’m going to lose so much weight for this wedding. And then, oh, I didn’t. I just kept being me and I got a last-minute spray tan instead. I just showed up to my sister’s wedding looking insane, just chubby and orange, which at the time was not presidential, okay, this is years prior. Probably started it. I remember one of the other bridesmaids in the party pulled me aside before like the aisle part, and she said, remember Beth, today is about your sister, it’s not about you. I was like, what? I can’t help that I’m pulling focus, okay. I’m orange and I have a dark brown u',\n",
              "  'pper lip. It sticks to the fur. Thankfully they got a divorce so those photos have been destroyed. It always amazes me whenever my sister gets married. You could look at it negatively. I think it’s a beautiful thing, I do. Do you know how hard it is to put yourself out there, over and over again, and be vulnerable enough to fall in love. I’m a full coward. I’m very noncommittal. If I’m ever at the altar and the pastor says, do you, Beth, take this person to be your whatever. If so, say I do. I’m just going to be like, eh, it’s not that I don’t. I just feel weird saying it in front of everybody. Good news is I come from a very pro-divorce family and my older sister and I, we never liked our middle sister’s first husband. He had a Samsung Galaxy. But I was praying that his would explode over his penis. Is that how religion works, I just started. I may have tweeted something to that effect, and he found the tweet, which I appreciate the follow, brother. But he got very upset and he showed the tweet to my sister. And he said, your sister’s tweeting about my dick getting blown off, with like the rage of a man who plays softball. And I am going to save it and I’m going to read it to the kids to sabotage their relationship with Beth. And I was like, whoa, I can’t believe I got him to read to his kids. My sister tried everything. I don’t know if you’ve ever planned a second or third wedding, but stuff starts flying off the truck. You find yourself cutting corners, saying things like, maybe we don’t need to walk down the aisle. We could already be down there. Or who needs a reception, we’ll just meet at the bar. And the dresses change over time. Your first wedding, you’re in a beautiful ball gown. And eventually you end up in a white business suit just like, this time I’m serious. Now of course, marriage can be a beautiful thing. I’m thankful I don’t feel the pressure to do it, but I love watching my sisters do it. I don’t love all the traditions they’ve kept. Like I don’t enjoy the bride sweepstakes, the giveaway part where our dad walks ’em down the aisle in a white dress. And he’s like, here are the untouched goods, you take care of it. It just feels weird, I don’t want my dad giving me away, like he never had me. I also feel there’s gotta be somebody better suited for the job. I was thinking about it long and hard, and what I came up with was maybe my ex-boyfriend, Nick, will do it, give me away. We had three wonderful years together. I loved him, he loved me. I actually have his name tattooed on my back, so he kind of owes me on this. And I broke up with him, but he’s married now, so maybe he’d like to hear from me. I don’t know. I found out he was married because of Instagram. I still follow his sister, she hasn’t blocked me yet. And she posted this beautiful photo of him and his wife on their wedding day, which I felt like was really in my face. I think if I asked him to do it, he would. And then Nick ',\n",
              "  'could walk me down the aisle and we’d get to my almost-husband, and then maybe like one last kiss and then Nick could lean into him and whisper something like there’s a little bit left, you know, or something. I don’t know, I’m workshopping it. I just want somebody to make an honest woman out of me. And then if his wife hates the idea I could offer to get her name tattooed under his. It’s like his name, her name, any children they have, I’m willing to do pets. I should be arrested. I really do have his name tattooed back there. Do you know how hard it is to get laid with another man’s name on your back? Not hard, it isn’t. Never been an issue. Despite everything I’ve said leading up to this point, I do have a relationship with my father. I just called him back yesterday, ’cause he had called me on Father’s Day and I wanted to get back. My parents divorced when I was young and my dad moved down to Orlando, Florida to be an actor, which is not where you go. He did, he eventually landed a role as Blackbeard at Pirate’s Cove mini putt-putt golf course. And when you know celebrities, there are going to be perks. So my two older sisters and I, we would leave our mom in Ohio and go down to Orlando to visit our dad because it was court-ordered. Free putt-putt, baby. My dad would dress like a pirate from here down. And then Alice, the manager at the time, would give my dad this huge Blackbeard head to put on top of his head that rested on his shoulders. And then he would walk around the mini golf place making people’s time better, question mark. But before my dad’s shift would start and before we ran off, he would pull us aside after we picked out our clubs and he’d gather us around and he’d get very serious and he’d be like, girls, listen up, get over here. Look at me. Listen. When the head goes on, look at me. When the head goes on. I’m not dad anymore. Very method, okay, which from one artist to another, I respected, but I was also the youngest of the three girls. You know when your sisters tell you to shut up? And then two seconds later you’re like, as we go on, we remember, and then they hit you and you’re like, I’m sorry. I forgot, seriously I forgot. So I did, I forgot. And I got a little hole in one and I started yelling for my dad instead of Blackbeard. And he found where the sound was coming from in the head, he was like at a higher hole. And he peeked around this blue waterfall and just looked down at us and shook the whole head, like no. I don’t know if you’ve ever disappointed a parent that has a bigger head on top of their head, but it’s like triple the disappointment. And also a little passive-aggressive, ’cause there’s like a huge smile on the outside of the face, But not on the inside. After that, he could have gone anywhere, Disney, Universal, the mall, but he bucked industry standards and he started his own business that’s called Stars on Call. He describes his work as live roadside commerc',\n",
              "  'ials or like character directionals. He dresses up in different costumes and he stands in front of businesses that are paying them to get people inside. I’m sure you have people like that here, right? It’s usually like a kid in front of Subway sandwiches with a sign and earbuds and like, fuck my life. My dad blows those assholes out of the water. He’s out there high-kicking. He’s pelvic thrusting. There’s a lot of raising the roof. He’s a leprechaun in front of this Irish pub called the Carry Him In. He’s a gorilla in front of Gold’s Gym. He’s a slice of pizza. Has anyone seen my dad? In the Orlando area? Real question, I like to ask, ’cause one time I think I was in Houston, a guy went, yo, is your dad, the fireman in front of Firehouse Subs. And I was like, yes, that’s my maker. He also does a fairly offensive portrayal of a Mexican in front of this place called Tijuana Flats, but he’s been doing it for 29 years, so at this point it is on them. If you call my dad’s number, he’ll answer and he’ll be like Stars on Call, this is Bert. Yeah, you want Chef Big Butt from three to five? No problem, I’ll send a man out. Always him. Nobody else works for that company. He’s a genius. I guess technically his wife. He found somebody to marry him down in Orlando and sometimes she’ll zip up his morph suit. As kids always felt like on our visits, my dad would like consistently choose our stepmom over me and my sisters, and like, I get it. You know, she gave him head and all we had were questions. But my dad has been in Orlando now for so long his personality is very much Fox news. Like, I mean, he’s so MAGA, he’s stealing jobs from the Mexicans. Growing up, we’d have these weekly calls that you have with your divorced parents and he would spew a fairly feminist rhetoric. He would always say, girls, remember to get the education you need to get the job you need, to get the car and the house you need. Then worry about the husband. And then in high school he started calling us and saying things like, if you ever get pregnant, I’ll take the baby. What? I don’t think he meant steal it, I think he meant take it and raise it. I wish more anti-choice people were like him. Like if you have it, I’ll take it. But they’re not, they just want you to have it. And then you never hear from ’em again. No thank you note, no money, it’s rude. I’m sure you’re wondering how hard it must’ve been for my mom to watch my dad go off and become a big star… on call, none-the-less. She’s fine. She’s currently sleeping with this very handsome, cavalier King Charles spaniel. His name is Nigel. She loves him. I feel like all he does is just try to eat her food and put his dick on our good pillows. I’ve been replaced. She sort of… She likes to update me on what they’re up to if they’re hanging and stuff. One time she sent me a photo of Nigel on the front porch. You know when a dog like splays their back legs out equally. So the hind is like, peu',\n",
              "  'www, you know what I mean? I better do it. Sorta like, when the dog is like fully flat, just like you know what I mean, it’s like penis to pavement, just like cooling his dick off on the cement. My mom sent me a photo of Nigel like this on the front porch, in the caption she wrote, it’s pretty hot here. I was like, ew. Is this a sext? Is this Nigel? My mom… Can you just imagine the dog, like ticka-ticka-tick… My mom has been out of the game for a while. I took her on a retirement trip and we were out to eat, we must have run out of things to talk about ’cause at the end of the meal I asked my mom, have you ever gotten a dick pic? She goes a nickel? I was like, what? Never mind, I don’t know why I even asked you that. Is anybody here with their mom? Oh you, good, I love it when people come with their mom, especially if I talk about something sexual, it’s so fun to look at you guys, because you’re usually like, I don’t know, are we laughing? Which I chalk up to like a sexual spectrum of mother, how moms raise their kid in regard to sex. ‘Cause on one side of the sexual spectrum, some moms are like, sex does not exist. And then their kids go away to college and they’re like, yes it does. And then there are moms on the opposite side of the sexual spectrum who say things like, hi honey, how was your orgasm? And you’re like, ew. I will not be coming home for Thanksgiving. Thankfully I didn’t have to deal with that. My mom is 100% a virgin. When she does start dating, I’m going to have to ask her like, how was your date? And then she’ll say, I don’t know, we were kissing, and then his penis got sharp. I don’t have to explain it to my mom. My sisters, on the other hand, love to bone. They like to have sex, get fertilized, wait for it to go from embryo, to fetus, to baby. And then they birth the baby. It’s like their thing. Whenever my oldest sister’s pregnant, her husband likes to announce it, and he’ll always say, “We’re pregnant!” Which has historically irked some people because they feel like the woman is doing a lot of the heavy lifting. I, however, have turned a corner and I like it, I do. ‘Cause it did, it took two people to do that thing, which is why I like to practice with all the men in my crowd before we go. I just like to practice saying we’re pregnant on three. So all the men in the crowd on three, we’ll say, “we’re pregnant.” One, two, three. We’re pregnant. Okay, you’re also drunk. Not everybody did it. If that didn’t resonate with you, I guess you could just go home and practice. We’re aborting. That’s honestly where we could use your help the most. For some reason, the stigma of abortion is just fully on a woman, it’s bonkers. Back where I’m from in Ohio, they were talking about putting a woman in prison if she gets an abortion and I’m like, eh, she had an accomplice. We haven’t had a Mary since that first one. And even then you’re telling me that God stopped at one kid. The self-restraint t',\n",
              "  'here is admirable. Like God just had Jesus and then we lost him. You think he’d try again. I just feel like mortal men, sometimes it feels like mortal men, you’re more careful pouring a beer than you are with your jizz. Just like, ooh, ooh, not too much head. It is like the only time you say that. And then privately you’re just spreading biomedical hazard, like…gooogggg I don’t blame you. Nobody teaches enough about this stuff. Some people don’t even like hearing the word abortion. But as long as birth control is hard for a lot of people to get and boners are hard to keep in condoms, they’re going to happen. I think we just got to stop looking at abortion like leftovers. Hear me out, keep breathing through the joke. Imagine it like this. Like a couple goes out for a big meal and they over-order, they’re reckless, they’re probably wasted. And at the end of the meal, there’s a bunch of leftovers and the dude says, you take them. And the woman says, oh, I don’t want them, you take them. And the dude says I can’t, I don’t have a fridge. And she asks then why did you put it in the box? You shouldn’t have put it in the box. Now we’re going to have to throw it away. And the dude says, “Okay, do you want me to like walk you to a trash can?” And then for some reason on the way to the trash can, there’s only random people yelling at her, like, “You wasteful bitch!” She’s like, what, he paid for half? I’m just saying abortion is not really the time to go Dutch, maybe treat her. And of course there’s a lot of good men out there. I was living in Bloomington, Indiana, and I saw a man praying in front of the Planned Parenthood. And I imagined that he was just saying like, dear God, please make sure that Brenda came here on Wednesday when she said she would. So there’s some good ones. Whenever my sisters are pregnant at the same time– like that’s happened simultaneously a couple times– people can’t help themselves, they always ask me like, did they plan it? I’m just like what does that look like for you? Do you think one of my sisters called the other and said, hey, what’s up, what are you doing? And the other was like, I don’t know, what are you doing? No. I don’t know what the season is for unprotected sex, but I think it’s always in Ohio. I have so many nieces and nephews running around, I can’t keep track. Sometimes I just have to wait for them to like play in a group, and then I shout out a name like, “Charlotte” and wait for one to turn. Get over here, let’s connect. I don’t even know what I would name kids if I had them. Obviously Jeremy, your parents struggled. I had a friend who actually named their daughter Harbor because she and her husband conceived her in this beautiful hotel in a harbor, which is truly disturbing. If my family did that, we would have so many Alleys and Sofas. Maybe like one The Woods, I’m from Ohio. And then what, they’re just supposed to call me mom? There’s already so many. I didn’t ',\n",
              "  'even know my mom had a first name until recently. I’d just been calling her mom for so long. And then she phoned me up and asked why haven’t you followed me back on Instagram? I was like, who’s Diane? I don’t even know if I would respond to mom. I’ve been called a female comic Ss many times I’d respond better to girl daddy. Just imagine my future imaginary son, like the last to get picked up, at probably afternoon kindergarten. And his teacher walks over to him and asks, Van, is your mother coming? And then he’ll be like, no, my girl dad is, she’s just always late. She’s probably picking up my sister, Shallow Grave. You guys have been so great. Thank you for listening.

I am so happy to be doing this in New York City. [cheering] Mmm! New York City, where I, for lack of a better term, do actually “live.” The other day, I was dry-swallowing my birth control pill as I Citi Biked up the Williamsburg Bridge and I was like, “Oh, my God. I guess I am the voice of my generation.” And it’s exhausting, but someone has to do it. [burps] I’m sorry… [audience laughs] Oh, I’m sorry. I literally can’t stop creating content. If this gets too tall, I will try to fuck it. So we have to… She has a type. I recently quit my job because I couldn’t wake up and go there. Does that resonate with anyone? Yeah. So, now I’ve been doing a lot of lying on my bed, just kind of waiting for the retweet, that’ll [clicks tongue] turn it all around. Social media is perfect, ’cause you can watch people you barely know sort of unravel in real time. Which I absolutely foot pop j’adore. No, jealousy is cool, ’cause it’s like swallowing a house that you just set on fire. [audience laughs] Not to be this bitch, but a pandemic, colon? Not what I had in mind. So ran… Literally, so random. I was like, “I did not know this was an option.” I was way more concerned with things just falling on my head. There’s a lot of stuff that’s up. And here I am beneath. But a pandemic is what we ultimately got. Which was rock and roll, normal and cool. The last year was absolutely exquisite. I gained a lot of weight over the last year, which isn’t good or bad. It isn’t good or bad. Not… It isn’t good or bad. So, it isn’t good or bad to gain weight because isn’t good or bad. And can you tell I had therapy two times this week? Yes. Oh, my God. A standing ovation so early in the show. I did not see that coming. Um, but it’s cool. One perk of gaining weight is that, obviously, my tits got huge. If you didn’t notice, it’s because you hate women. My tits got big enough that I can now, like all the great poets who came before me, titty fuck my boyfriend. [audience cheers] Thank you. Thank you. No, no. And that’s not why I do it. I don’t like being the girl who’s like, [whining] “My boyfriend, my boyfriend,” I feel like girls who are like, [whining] “My boyfriend, my boyfriend,” are the same kind of girls who are like, [in nasal voice] “There is actually too much sugar in fruit.” [in normal voice] “So, for me, it’s a dessert.” And then their mouth goes all the way around their face. But I',\n",

Did you think… Be honest. Did you think you’d hear “cock” this early in the show? Cock is such a porny word. I famously love porn, if my boyfriend tells me the girl looks like me. Otherwise, it is bad for women. And that’s just where I stand on that issue. So, I was, for the last time, titty fucking my boyfriend. Humble brag. And… when he came… [clicks tongue] Yeah. Could hear a freaking pin drop. When he came, [smacks lips] he made a sound I’ve never heard before. And I was like, “[chuckles] Okay. I’m a sex goddess.” I turn to him, I say… [clicks tongue] “How was that for you?” And he goes, “It was actually almost painful.” Um, feminist win much? Yes. I’m doing the work. Oh, there’s such a good energy in here. I… You’re family. [audience cheers] I love. I love. What a summer. It’s been a time. I hate the summer. All I’ve ever done in a bikini is sob. But one thing I love about summer, I have to say, is those hot, hot summer anthems. So, if the DJ could just drop that track real quick, that’d be sick. I’m really more of a dancer than a comedian.

              "  'e some exciting news. I… [chuckles] recently read a book. [scattered laughter] [cheering] Thank you. [mouthing] Thank you. I love you. I have a rare disease where if I read a book, the whole time I’m looking at it, I’m like, [chuckles] “Look at you. Reading a book.” “You stupid, stupid slut.” Just ’cause I don’t like to read, write, argue or be alone, doesn’t mean I’m not an intellectual. [cheering] That’s my crowd work. I actually won a very prestigious award lately. Hold for applause. I won an award for leaving my home without my phone for 42 minutes. Yeah. Thank you. And, no, and that’s not why I do it. And that’s not why I do it. When I did that, I had what critics and fans alike are calling “a lady in a movie moment.” “What’s that? What’s that? What could that possibly be? What is that?” So, “a lady in a movie moment” is when something happens to you that might happen to a lady in a movie. So, for example, if you, um… if you check the mail with your little key… Lady in a movie. [laughter] If you hold a baguette… If you’re even near a baguette… Lady in a movie. And if you, say it with me, run into your ex on the street, that is full-blown, hundy p, lady in a… [audience] Lady in a movie. Thank you. Oh! It feels good to be at home. So, I did recently, like a cartoon, have a lady in a movie moment. I ran into my ex on the street. [scoffs] And he was wearing a suit. He looked incredible. Which is, as we know, illegal. And I was wearing… What’s it called when you, like, don’t shave your legs for three months and then you shave ’em really quick and there’s blood everywhere? [audience laughs] So, I was wearing that. And we ran into each other, and he’s one of these people who uses your name in a sentence. It’s like… Whoa. [chuckles] If you use my name in a sentence, you need to either fuck me or kill me. There’s no in-between. On this occasion, he kind of chose to do neither, which was, of course, a power move and not at all related to how he feels about me. I’m sorry. I just choked on my own human tongue. Breakups are cool. Right? I’m a guy’s girl. Breakups are cool. Breakups are freaking sick. Breakups are cool because it’s like you have a best friend and then they die. [audience laughs] And then, instead of going to their funeral, you go and fuck a long-haired guy named Randy in the back seat of a red Mazda in the parking lot of a water park. And when you ask him to drive you home, he goes, “I can’t. I’m on shrooms.” What stage of grief is that? Which one? No. Okay, that’s good. Get back to me on that. I… I learned a lot from my ex, though. It’s cool. I never thought, and I’m sorry, I get choked up when I talk about this. But, I, um… [exhales] Here I go again. He knows. I never thought [sighs] that I could love someone who can watch an entire movie while sitting upright in a wooden chair. But love works in mysterious ways. I mean, she really, really does. My ex and I lived together for three years. And we actually kept living together two months after we broke up. Which is, of course, say it with me, good for the environment. Oops, I just ran f',\n",
              "  'or office. Oops, I just won. [audience laughs] Thankfully… [chuckles] Imagine. [audience laughs] No, thank you. [vocalizing whooshing] Um… Whenever… Whenever I think… I’m like, “Who decides where the streets go?” I think about that a lot. And all I think is, “I am so glad that’s not my job.” So, thankfully, I live by myself now. When I first moved into my own apartment, I fully developed a, say it with me, new personality. I have a lot of new traits now. I recently went to a Chipotle at 10:45 a.m. Doctor’s orders. And when I walked in, I was like… ‘Cause I’m cool. When I walk into Chipotle… Up here, I’m all… At Chipotle, I get it. I’m like… [audience laughing] [smacks lips] I walk into a Chipotle and the guy working there… Yes, a man. Important for the story. He’s like, “What do you want?” And I’m like, “Okay. He wants to have raw dog sex with me.” No. I say, “Hello. I would like a chicken burrito bowl.” “I know guac is extra and I’ll take the hottest sauce.” He goes, “[scoffs] You sure?” [moans] I was like, “Oh, my God.” [in young girl voice] “Am I sure?” Mmm… “I don’t know.” “I never thought about that before.” [smacks lips] “I don’t think about big boy questions like that.” “I’m just a little girly.” “I think about little girly things like earrings.” “And shoes. I don’t know about big boy stuff like that.” “I’m just a little baby with titties.” [in normal voice] Oh, I’m sorry. I just completely blacked out. Did I do something? Wait, did I say something annoying? I don’t think we should kill all the men. Hold for applause. But I don’t think men should be allowed to make movies. [audience member whoops] Superhero movies are so boring I could melt into the Earth. I don’t care about movies that are about, like, sand… or rope, or space. The only kind of movies I want to watch are where a woman looks at herself in her medicine cabinet mirror and says… [in deep voice] “Hello, stranger.” [in normal voice] That’s kind of the genre that works for me. That being said, I do wanna be the first person in a Marvel movie who’s never seen a Marvel movie. So, DM me. You know, it’s sad. I do have a hard time with men, but even I… Even I can’t resist.

[audience applauding, cheering] Ooh. Okay. I feel so randomly safe with y’all. So comfortable. Family, family, family. I can reveal now, at this point in the program… [laughs] In high school, my nickname was Critter. I think ’cause I’m conventionally attractive and… [audience laughs] I didn’t love it because Critter was shortened to “Crit.” To me, that sounded a lot like “Clit.” And I was like, “What’s happening with my one life?” But… Honestly, now, like, I am a lot like a clit. I’m extremely sensitive, I love to be touched, and straight guys just don’t know what to do with me. Sometimes they want to fuck me, and sometimes they think I’m like a fun aunt ’cause my energy is like… [hums] And I’m always at restaurants moaning along when the waiter tells me the specials. I’m always like, “Mmm, risotto.” Mmm. ‘Cause it’s always a mushroom risotto. Fuck yes! [audience] Whoo! Wow! That mushroom risotto joke is an absolute banger. Um… Thank you so much. Have a great night. No. You wish. You sick fucks. But I got more to give. I actually was supposed to go to my ten-year high school reunion recently. But I couldn’t go because I was, um, jerking off on the floor of my apartment. “Why the floor? Why the floor? Why the floor?” I was too lazy to close the window curtain that looks into the bed. So, I was like, “Floor it is.” And I think everyone here knows, but I do actually have a mirrored armoire in my bedroom. If you don’t know what an armoire is, now would be an awesome time to leave the show. [audience laughs] Thank you. Bye. So I’m jerking off on the floor. And the way I do it is beached-whale style, which means I just lay on my hand and [trills] away. And when I looked up into my mirrored armoire, I saw something I really wouldn’t wish on anyone. I saw… [chuckles] in its organic, hardy, grass-fed, natural state… my O face. Without the performance of sex, the pressure of another, I saw what I looked like when I cum, which is… [audience laughing] So, when I cum, this is actually my O face. I don’t want to be like this. By the way, if my face was symmetrical, I would not be up here doing this shit. Goes without saying, I don’t want to be this way. I want to be the kind of girl who just wears jeans. I wish I could do… You know when people do that? I can’t jump even a little. This is literally me jumping as high as I can. I wish I could be the kind of girl who’s like… Sometimes people’s legs go up. I want to be the kind of girl who just d',\n",
              "  'oesn’t like the taste of beer. The kind of girl who can save half a sandwich for later. The kind of girl who can go into a coffee shop and just stare at sheet music. [sighs] Just clutch it and stare at it and be like, “I get this.” [audience laughs] I want to be the kind of woman who’s out to lunch with friends, she’s draped in silks, draped in silks, draped in silks. The restaurant, of course, white tablecloth, white tablecloth. And she starts to laugh because she remembers something funny, a memory maybe. But before she does, she stops herself. She says… [laughing] “I was in love once.” So that’s the kind of girl I want to be. But I have career goals too. [woman] Whoo! Girl boss. Um, I really, really… And this is serious. This is off the record. I really want to wear a bonnet on screen. Does anyone have one? I have such a face for hats. I have the world’s roundest face. Thank you. No. Don’t all stand up at once. I really want to wear a bonnet on screen. Um… And then my second career goal is I want to be in a film where I’m going on a first date, and as I’m kissing my suitor goodnight, I close the door shut to my apartment, and then I turn around and I just… Yes. I slide against that door. I hooked up with a guy I met on a first date once ’cause I’m a slut. Take back the word. And mid-moment, he was like, “Oh, yeah. I love that fat, fat ass.” And I was like… “Maybe one fat was enough.” [audience laughs] I do. I do. I… I know. I gravely want to be thin because of society. [playing piano] Because thin privilege is real. If you’re thin… This is my ideal body type. If you’re thin, you can be famous for smoking a cigarette and looking sad. If you’re fat and there’s a photo of you smoking a cigarette and looking sad, it’s a campaign for something. It’s some D.A.R.E. shit. You know what I mean? [chuckles] But mostly I want to be thin so I can wear whatever clothes I want, whenever I want. Because, as we all know, women’s clothing sizes are totally fucked.

              "  \"mm. [sighs] “A poem I wrote last night when I couldn’t go to sleep, because there are no sheets on my bed because I perioded on my other sheets and cannot be bothered to put new ones on.” “I’m sorry I didn’t text you back about borrowing my adult sized tutu for your sketch comedy show.” “I was on the L train trying to recall how I knew the guy sitting across from me.” “Turns out it was from sex. Thank you so much.” So this next poem… [audience laughs] This is called “Poem I wrote after my therapist got mad at me for thinking everyone’s mad at me.” “I just found out ‘dog’ isn’t short for something.” “It’s actually just called a dog, which is fine with me.” “I’m in the kitchen, alone. Which is romantic in a way.” “Anything can be romantic if you sigh a lot.” “One time, I told this guy I loved him.” He said, “I don’t know what love is.” “Anyway, he just got engaged.” Thank you. [audience laughs] “Poem I wrote after I masturbated while wearing AirPods.” It could happen to you, so be vigilant. “Sometimes, being an adult means washing your hair.” “Sometimes, the only way to know if a guy is definitely straight is if he Instagrams a building.” “Sometimes I feel like if I look at my phone, I will die or worse, not die.” “It’s insane when you ask someone to give you space and then they do.” Thank you. This next poem is called “A poem I wrote after you told me your ex is ‘actually really cool.'” “A guy on the street said I looked like I was studying audio engineering in school.” [audience laughs] “He told me he liked my outfit. He told me to have a ‘cool day.'” “I’m googling how long a stroke lasts.” Thank you. “Poem I wrote after you went down on me and then called me ‘dude.'” [audience laughs] “I have a disease where I never want to get out of the Uber.” “Because then it means I have to be somewhere.” “For years I’ve been suffering from a serious addiction to Adam Driver and Jason Schwartzman, even.” “Maybe my crush hasn’t texted because I’m out of town.” “But then again, I never told him I was going out of town.” [audience laughs] “I’m always horny and looking for somewhere to charge my phone.” “The Paris Review came in the mail today and I performed reading it.” “I can’t write if no one is watching.” “I can’t stop checking my pussy for weird bumps.” “One time I went to the doctor and when she told me I gained fifteen pounds, I was like, ‘That’s a lot.’ And she was just like, ‘Yeah.'” Thank you. [applause and cheering] I love sex because it famously has no consequences. [audience laughs] I was recently at the Newark Airport. Brag. And I saw a headline on a magazine. Vintage. And it read, “Couple fucks themselves off side of cliff.” Where were you? When you found out? How you were going to die? Because for me, I was like, “Oh, that’s an option.” [audience laughs] I love fuck. I have some sexual fantasies I want to share with you all. My first sexual fantasy is that I’m in a mahogany room. Built-in bookcases. Built-in bookcases. Built-in bookcases. And I’m sitting in a velvet wingback chair. And I put my ring finger to my temple and I just say, “Ugh. I \",\n",
              "  'worry. I do.” [audience laughs] And then my other sexual fantasy is that he makes me cum, damn it. Am I right, ladies? Is that a lot to ask? Honey, I’m looking for a guy tall enough that I don’t have to get on my knees when I want to blow him. That’s right. I want to stand up, dick should be here. [audience laughs] I hooked up with… [chuckles] I hooked up with this guy I met at a bar because I’m brave, and he was like, “I actually biked to this bar. I can bike us back to my place.” “You can ride on my pegs.” And I was like, [in British accent] “Absolutely not.” [smacks lips] [audience laughs] [in normal voice] He was like, “No. it’s okay. It can hold 120 pounds.” And I was like, “Okay, you don’t know what math is. You are my type.” [audience laughs] I just feel like it’s like every chubby girl’s nightmare to be carried in a playful way. Like, I’m pretty sure when I was born, the nurse, like, picked me up and handed me to my mom, and I was like, “It’s okay. You can put me down.” [audience laughs] It’s sad. After I slept with him, I woke up with a, say it with me, bump on my pussy. Just lucky, I guess. Foot pop, j’adore. And I was like, “Great. I need to reach out to my gynecologist about this.” So, I had to access her through, say it with me, The Portal. [audience laughs] I’m s… Why are doctors absolutely, clinically addicted to making you enter through a portal? It’s like… “I’m here.” It’s like, “Can I just get an email or…” They want you to be like… [audience laughs] They want you to be full Narnia vibes to talk to them about your broken pussy. A portal? Oh, my God. What year is it? Okay. I don’t… I hate sci-fi. There’s enough… There’s enough stuff here… that’s really interesting. We don’t have to… We don’t have to… I don’t need anything with wings. Bitch, I have ’em. Oh, my God. So, I was like, “I need to take a picture of this to send to my gynecologist.” So, I went into my studio, which is obviously an empty room with a full-size mattress on the floor. And I took out my camera, which is obviously an iPhone rose gold Plus with a cracked screen, ’cause I’m fun. Spread my lips and I took an image. I wish that were the end of the story. I’m going to do a lap. When I looked at that image, um… Are you okay to hear this? Ally. [audience laughs] Feminist ally. When I looked at the image, it was one of the most harrowing things I’ve ever seen. One, I used flash. Rookie mistake. Two, I didn’t understand the reach of my camera. So, when I looked at the picture, I didn’t only see my spread pussy lips, which I expected. But, in the background, I saw what can only be described as my dead-eyed face. [audience laughs] No expression. Just a corpse’s head, really. So, I had to crop that out for legal reasons. And when I sent it to my gyne, she was like, “There’s nothing wrong with you.” I know there’s a long history of doctors not believing women, but in my case, doctors shouldn’t believe me because I’m what many medical professionals have called a dumbass bitch. Thank you to my fans. [audience laughs] But it was stressful. Oh, my God. And the thing about st',\n",

              "  'S, or “Pecos” for cute. Boop, boop, boop. [beeping playfully] Everything online about women’s health is like, “We don’t know.” [audience laughs] I get really bad migraines with visual auras. Which means I’m inherently interesting. And when you ask a doctor, “What are migraines?” They’re all just like… So I have PCOS. Let me tell you about PCOS. It’s honestly iconic. Um… The symptoms are one, you’re fat. No, stop. Two, you are losing hair on your head, but, three, you have hair on your face, and four, you have acne. So, it’s sort of this, like, waking nightmare in which you’re both young and old at the same time. It’s like that optical illusion where the young woman’s looking away and the old woman’s looking down. [audience laughs] But in this case, it’s just you looking at yourself in the mirror thinking, “Maybe God isn’t a woman.” [audience laughs] But if she is, I want to meet her. Um, if I have to die, which I’m not super interested in, I know that, literally, on my death bed, I’ll be, like, surrounded by millions of loved ones. And in my last dying breath I’ll be like… [gasping] “Does my hair look better [sniffs] half up or full down?” [audience laughs] Those are a hundy p gonna be my last words. How I really want to die is hosting a fabulous dinner party. Twelve people. Yeah. My apartment in my fantasy you can have a table that that’s big. That’s that’s big. That’s that big. Hard to say, easy to write. Came to me like that. [audience laughs] Ooh. J’adore. I can’t… I literally don’t know a single word of French. English, I can do. Oh, my God. I once was studying abroad, ’cause I’m so interesting. And I was studying abroad and I was out clubbing with these, like, hot Italian guys. And they were like… [laughs] They were like, “Your English is really good.” [audience laughs] And I was like, “Mm-hmm.” At first I was like, “It’s the only language I speak.” But then I thought about it and I was like, “My English is really good.” [audience laughs] And what’s so bad about taking a compliment? Especially as women. Especially in this industry. We have to learn to stop apologizing and just say, “Yeah. My English is really good.” [audience laughs] So, how I want to die is I’m at this dinner party and everyone’s having their own bottle of wine, and that’s normal and fine and no one notices. And then the person next to me goes, “Oh, my God. I love that painting.” And I say, “Oh, thank you. My friend painted that.” And then later in the evening, I’m lying in bed with my lover. And he looks to me and he says, “What’s wrong?” And I say, “You know, I just…” “I feel a kind of longing that resembles sadness only in the way that mist resembles rain.” And then I expire. [audience laughs] And he’s like, “Was that a Wordsworth poem?” And I’m like, “I think it was Longfellow. Can’t remember.” From beyond. From the beyond we argue about who wrote that line. Um, goals. I am in love right now, as insane as that sounds. [audience whooping] I know.

Stan Lathan, who directed Chappelle’s six other specials for the streamer, returns to direct “The Dreamer.” Chappelle’s previous Netflix specials include “The Age of Spin” (2017), “Deep in the Heart of Texas” (2017), “Equanimity” (2017), “The Bird Revelation” (2017), “Sticks & Stones” (2019) and “The Closer” (2021). “Dave Chappelle: The Dreamer” premiered globally on Netflix December 31, 2023 \\xa0The trailer, published by Netflix on December 25, 2023, is narrated by Morgan Freeman, who also makes an appearance alongside Chappelle. “What do you dream about? Not the dreams you have in your sleep: the ones you hold in your heart. Don’t be intimidated by the audacity of your dream — be inspired by it,” Freeman says in the trailer. “What happens to a dream deferred? Lucky for Dave, he doesn’t know.” Unchanged: “What do you dream about? Not the dreams you have in your sleep: the ones you hold in your heart. Don’t be intimidated by the audacity of your dream — be inspired by it,” Freeman says in the trailer. “What happens to a dream deferred? Lucky for Dave, he doesn’t know.” Watch the trailer below. * * * In a deeply reflective and often humorous monologue, Dave Chappelle recounts his journey from a struggling comedian handing out tickets on the avenue to a celebrated artist returning to the stage 24 years after his first HBO special, Killin’ Them Softly. He shares personal anecdotes, including the influence of his late artistic father and comedian Norm MacDonald, and his encounter with Jim Carrey. Chappelle addresses the controversies surrounding his jokes about the transgender community, asserting his decision to pivot from such material while wryly introducing a new target: the handicapped. He recounts an assault at the Hollywood Bowl, weaving in a narrative about his friend and fellow comedian Chris Rock, who experienced a similar public altercation. Chappelle draws parallels between their experiences, highlighting the unpredictable nature of fame and public scrutiny. He shares insights into his marriage, the surreal aspects of fame, and the complex interplay of identity and public persona. Chappelle concludes with a poignant meditation on dreams, sharing stories of Lil Nas X and others, and expressing gratitude to Washington D.C. for shaping him. He leaves the audience with a reminder of the fluidity and shared nature of dreams, asserting his place in the world with a sense of both humility and command. * * * “IF ONE ADVANCES CONFIDENTLY IN THE DIRECTION OF HIS DREAMS,\\nAND ENDEAVORS TO LIVE THE LIFE WHICH HE HAS IMAGINED,\\nHE WILL MEET WITH A SUCCESS UNEXPECTED IN C',\n",
              "  'OMMON HOURS.” – Henry David Thoreau DAVE CHAPPELLE LIVE FROM WASHINGTON, D.C. THE\\nDREAMER [audience cheering and applauding] [audience cheering] [Dave] All right. Almost 24 years ago… it was the last time I was on the stage in this room. [audience cheering] I was taping my first one-hour special. It was called Killin’ Them Softly. My girlfriend was sitting in that row, pregnant. She’s now my wife. The baby that she was carrying, my first child… I smoke weed with that n*gga now… And what I remember most about that night was the pressure. Before the show, I had to run out on the avenue and hand out tickets to anybody who would take ’em ’cause I couldn’t even fill the fucking room. And, boy, what a difference 24 short years makes. And right before that time, my father had died. He never lived to see me do it. And when he died, I was inconsolable. I thought I’d never smile or laugh again. And the only thing that got me out of that space was a comedian friend of mine, the late, great Norm MacDonald. That’s right, shout out for Norm. And what Norm did, which I’ll never forget, as he knew that I was the biggest Jim Carrey fan in the world. I’m not gonna go into it, but Jim Carrey is talented in a way that you can’t practice or rehearse. What a God-given talent. I was fascinated with him. And Norm knew that. He called me up, and he goes, “Dave, I’m…” He says, “I’m doing a movie with Jim Carrey…” “Do you want to meet him?” And I said, “Fuck, yes, I do.” It was the first time I could remember, since my father died, being excited. And the movie was called Man on the Moon. I didn’t know any of this. In this movie, Jim Carrey was playing another comedian I admired. The late, great Andy Kaufman. Yes, and Jim Carrey was so immersed in that role, that from the moment he woke up, to the time he went to bed at night, he would live his life as Andy Kaufman. I didn’t know that. When they said, “Cut,” this n*gga was still… Andy Kaufman. So much so that everybody on the crew called him Andy. I didn’t know that. I just went to meet him. When he walked into the room we were to meet, I screamed, “Jim Carrey!” And everyone said, “No!” “Call him Andy.” And I didn’t understand. He came over and was acting weird. I didn’t know he was acting like Kaufman. Just like, “Hey, how you doing?” And I was like, “Hello… Andy?” Now… in hindsight, how fucking lucky am I that I got to see one of the greatest artists of my time immersed in one of his most challenging processes ever? Very lucky to have seen that. But as it was happening… I was very disappointed. Because I wanted to meet Jim Carrey, and I had to pretend this n*gga was Andy Kaufman… all afternoon. It was clearly Jim Carrey. I could look at him and I could see he was Jim Carrey. Anywa',\n",
              "  'y, I say all that to say… that’s how trans people make me feel. Here we go. Now, if you guys came here to this show tonight… thinking that I’m gonna make fun of those people again, you’ve come to the wrong show. I’m not fucking with those people anymore. It wasn’t worth the trouble. I ain’t saying shit about trans people. Maybe three or four times tonight, but that is it. Tired of talking about them. You wanna know why I’m tired of talking about ’em? Because these people acted like I needed them to be funny. Well, that’s ridiculous. I don’t need you. I’ve got a whole new angle. You guys will never see this shit coming. I ain’t doing trans jokes no more. Know what I’mma do tonight? Tonight… I’m doing all handicapped jokes. Well, they’re not as organized as the gays. And I love punching down. There’s probably a handicap in the back right now ’cause that’s where they make them sit. “I came here to laugh at transgender people.” “I didn’t know this n*gga was gonna make jokes about us.” “Come on, y’all, let’s get the fuck up out of here.” Yeah, it’s about time somebody let these handicaps have it. N*gga met their match tonight. Fuck ’em. One time I was on Capitol Hill, and I seen a handicapped congressman. Madison Cawthorn, that’s his name. [woman] Oh! He’s a Republican from North Carolina. And he was shocked ’cause I saw him and I go, “Hello, Congressman.” He didn’t even know I knew who he was. He turned… Then I just walked away. I wanted him to see me do something he couldn’t do. I skipped. That n*gga was mad. He’s no longer a congressman. I don’t know if you follow politics. I’m not trying to be funny, but he lost his seat… He ran a bad race. Oh, buddy, yes, he did. You know what he did wrong? He was running for Congress again, and this motherfucker tried to be controversial. He was on all them right wing podcast talking all that shit. He was like, “Washington is worse than Hollywood.” I was at home, like, “What?” He said, “These people are disgusting. They have orgies and sex parties and drug parties.” And I was thinking, “This n*gga sounds like Juicy Smoo-yay.” He’s lying! Now, I don’t doubt that they do this kind of shit in Washington, but I doubt he’s seen it with his own eyes. Because who the fuck invites a paraplegic to an orgy? So this n*gga can roll around and snitch on everybody? [mouthing] I said there’s only one reason you gonna invite him to an orgy. And you know what that is. “Have at it, guys, I can’t feel anything. Let’s get this bill passed for America. One at a time, folks! Oh, buddy. Yep, yep, yep. The other handicaps are the new people I punch down on. To be honest with you, I’ve been trying to repair my relationship with the transgender community. ‘Cause I don’t want them to think that I ',\n",
              "  \"don’t like them. You know how I’ve been repairing it? I wrote a play. I did. ‘Cause I know that gays love plays. It’s a very sad play, but it’s moving. It’s about a Black transgender woman whose pronoun is, sadly, n*gga… It’s a tear-jerker. At the end of the play, she dies of loneliness ’cause white liberals don’t know how to speak to her. Sad… Speaking of n*gga… I’ve also been working on a book, and this is true. I’m rewriting the American Classic, Huckleberry Finn, from N*gger Jim’s perspective. It’s called The Adventures of N*gger Jim. That’s how the book starts. Huckleberry Finn walks up to him and goes, “You’re N*gger Jim.” And he’s like, “Yo, I just said ‘Jim.'” “What’s your name, little buddy?” “Huckleberry Finn is my name.” “What? Huckleberry? That’s your real name?” “God-given.” [exhales] “You know what? Just call me N*gger Jim, it’s fine.” I don’t care if you are Black or White or whatever. If you ever meet a white person named Huckleberry, he has less money than you. That is the white trashiest name I’ve ever heard in my fucking life. If you have a name like Huckleberry, you’re doomed to fail. If I was in court and my lawyer came up like, “I am your attorney, Huckleberry Finn.” I’d be like, “Uh-oh, I’m going to jail.” God forbid I ever go to jail. But if I do, I hope it’s in California. ‘Cause soon as the judge sentence me, I’ll be like, “Before you sentence me, I want the court to know… I identify as a woman. Send me… to a woman’s jail.” As soon I get in there, you know what I’mma be doing. “Give me your fruit cocktail, bitch, before I knock your motherf*cking teeth out. I’m a girl, just like you, bitch. Come here and suck this girl’s dick I got. Don’t make me explain myself. I’m a girl” You know, I have a great reputation in show business, but in comedy, I’m what’s known as a lazy comedian. Which is crazy ’cause I work all the time, but that’s not why they call me lazy. They call me lazy ’cause I do shows sometimes… Twenty thousand people be in the crowd, and I’ll tell a joke, and they’ll all look at me like I’m crazy. But three or four people will laugh really hard. And I’ll be on stage like, “Yeah, that’s good enough.” Well, this next joke is one of those jokes that… You know what I mean? I like to tell it, but it never does good. But I’m gonna do it. Know what I don’t do good? I’m not good at impressions, but this is an impression. You ready? Okay. This is not gonna work. A’ight, this is my impression. It’s my impression… [exhales] of the dead people on the Titanic… You didn’t let me finish. This is my impression of the dead people on the Titanic, as the submersible was approaching their ship. That’s good enough. All right, here it goes. I… Okay, here it goes. [trilling voice] Come join us\",\n",
              "  ' in our watery grave. [normal voice] Oh, buddy, that’s funny to me. Listen, that is a funny way to die. Twenty years from now, on my 70th birthday, I’m gonna take a submersible to see the submersible. Hopefully, by then it should work. My wife hates that joke. You know… Do you know there’s a strip club in D.C. called Camelot? [audience whooping] Is that still open? [audience] Yes! I know what I’m doing after the show. I gotta tell you… the other day, my wife called me creepy. You know, I frequent strip clubs. It’s something I like to do. And my wife said I was creepy ’cause I go to strip clubs by myself. Is that creepy? I think that’s better than going with the fellas. That’s creepy to me. “Hey, let’s all go to the strip club and get our dicks hard together as a group of friends. Drive home in a quiet car and not talk about any of the things we’ve seen or done.” No, n*gga, I go by myself. But my wife doesn’t understand why I go to the strip club. It has nothing to do with sex. I need a pinch of sexual energy in the room to relax, but it’s more about being out. I like the music. A few naked chicks in there makes me feel good, but I’m not trying to socialize or meet anybody. You know, sometimes I go to a strip club and I bring a book. I do, and I sit right by the stage ’cause the reading light is better. [mouthing] One time I went to a strip club, and this is weird, I don’t know why… The stripper, for some reason, told me her real name. I know. So I left. She didn’t understand. She’s like, “Where are you going?” I was like, “Good night, Deborah.” God bless her, but my wife is mistaken about my life. She told me once she thinks my job is fun. My job is a job. I’m fun. It’s too dangerous, man. You know, all last year… I was touring with, arguably one of the greatest, if not the greatest living comedian, Chris Rock. Me and him toured all year last year. And right before that tour started, Chris was involved in what we Blacks might even consider a goddamn 9/11. Chris got slapped in the face at the Oscars… by Will Smith, which was one of the craziest things I’d ever seen. In fact, if you watch it live on television, like I did, when it happened, I thought it was fake. I did, and I wasn’t sure. So, I waited ’cause unlike you, I know Chris. I waited 30, 40 minutes. As long as it’ll take him to get to another party. And I called him on FaceTime and he picked up. Soon as he picked up, he said, “Yous the only n*gga I’d answer the phone for.” Apparently, Obama and Oprah, everybody called this n*gga to see if everything’s all right… And I thought it was fake. I didn’t know. So I asked. I go, “Well, you know.” He said, “What?” I said, “Did it hurt?” He said, “Yes, n*gga, it hurt.” And then I knew that it was real. And t',\n",
              "  'hen, and only then, was I offended. I wasn’t just offended he got slapped. That was only half of it. The offensive part was after he slapped him, Will just sat down and enjoyed the rest of his evening. It was crazy. He was… [mouthing] “Thank you.” What the fuck is this? And then all year we was touring, and I couldn’t wait to see what he was going to say in his special about this slap. I told him all year, but the night he taped his special… Chris is one of these guys who’s crafty. You never know what he’s gonna say until he says it. I went to see him tape his special. He taped it up the street, in Baltimore. Now, you guys are from D.C., so you know about Baltimore? We all know that through the years, D.C. has been through some very, very tough times. Sadly, Baltimore is still in a very tough time. Not everybody in the world really can understand the depth of Baltimore. Baltimore is so desperate that… Tupac and his mother moved from Baltimore to Oakland for a better life. And Chris Rock went so hard on the paint. And I can’t believe he did this. He shocked a Baltimore crowd. I didn’t know that was possible. I started doing comedy here. Shocked ’em. And you know what he said that got ’em? He looked at the crowd… I didn’t expect him to say this. He looked the crowds. All Black. Baltimore Black… Even if you rich and Black in Baltimore, you know them n*ggas is traumatized about something. Chris shocked them. This is what he said. He went to that crowd. He said… “I refuse to be a victim.” The crowd said… [gasps] And I was backstage looking like, “N*gga watch the tape.” I know it’s fucked up, but I tell you the truth, you know, everything’s funny. Everything’s funny ’til it happens to you. Three months. A mere three months after that terrible attack that Chris Rock endured… I was on stage at the Hollywood Bowl. And a lunatic… jumped out of the crowd and attacked me. I got to tell you, if it happens to you, you don’t know what happened. It was like slow motion. I don’t know this n*gga… I just looked and said, “Oh, my God. I’m being attacked.” And this motherfucker was ragged. He jumped me like, “Aah!” I’m old, but I’m fast. I caught this motherfucker’s head with my hand and pulled his hoodie over his eyes. I can still feel his head in my hand. It was spongy. He had been growing dreadlocks. Not the beautiful dreads that Rastafarians grow. These were accidental L.A. homeless dreads. This shit had leaves and sticks and bottle caps and shit in it. Some kind of grease. I was like, “Ugh!” Like this. And then I fell down. He knocked me all the way on the ground. I was like, “Man, this is a bad situation. I don’t know if I’m going to die or what’s gonna happen.” But in that moment of vulnerability, you know what occurre',\n",
              "  'd to me that it never occurred to me before in my life? In that moment, it occurred to me that bodyguards… should not wear dress shoes to work! Travis! This n*gga, Travis, came out slipping and sliding in some kind of beautiful loafer and fell flat on the back. I said, “Oh, my God. Now both of us are down. I gotta handle this shit myself.” I popped right back… And the kid that knocked me down, he popped up. And we looked at each other and realized, same time, I was bigger than him. And that motherfucker took off running. I started to chase him, and I said, “Eh, fuck him.” I picked the microphone up. Said, “I’m gonna finish this show now.” That’s right. For three months before that, I had been making fun of Chris Rock. And people would ask me all the time. They say, “Dave, what would you do if you were Chris Rock and Will Smith slapped you in the face?” And to this day, the answer is the same. “I don’t know what I would have done.” I’ve never been in a situation that extreme. But I do know now what Will Smith would not have done. And that is, enjoy the rest of his evening. Man, listen. We gave that kid a good wallop. We was whooping his ass. Not “we.” I was on stage trying to think of a joke to tell, but they was beating this n*gga up right behind me. Everybody could see it. Everybody could see it. I’m sitting up there trying to think of what to say. I’m tongue tied. Me, of all people, can’t think of anything to say. Look at my karma. Just that moment, of all the people in the world, Chris Rock walks from backstage. Walks up to me in front of 20,000 people, grabs the mic out of my hands and looks at the crowd and goes, “Was that Will Smith?” Man, motherfuckers fell out of their chairs, laughing. I was standing there looking stupid. I was fucking furious. ‘Cause I’m thinking in my mind, “N*gga, this is my attack. You got attacked three months ago. Now you have jokes?” So, I snatched the mic back from Chris and tried to get one off, but my shit did not go good at all. I didn’t know… I was like, “It was a trans man.” And the crowd was like… “Boo. This is L.A., we like trans people. Boo.” I know, I felt so bad. I felt so bad. But I know why he did it. You’d have to be there to understand, but, man, when that guy tackled me, it was like a movie or something. You gotta picture this. Picture a famous person you like. Every famous person you could imagine was at that show. It was, like, the biggest night that Hollywood had ever seen. And when that guy tackled me, he cleared the bleachers. I had to watch the tape afterwards to know this happened, but as soon as he tackled me, Jamie Foxx was the first motherfucker that jumped out of the crowd. He was wearing a white cowboy hat, like, he knew this shit was going to h',\n",
              "  'appen. Never seen this n*gga in a cowboy hat before. And Jamie started chasing that motherfucker around like Any Given Sunday. And that kid was fast. His shit was juking and shaking. And it broke Jamie’s ankles, and he just kept running. Then Jon Stewart, from the Daily Show, ran from backstage and jumped at this motherfucker like Super Jew. He was, like… The kid’s seen Jon coming, so he jumped back and Jon went flying that way. This kid was fast. Then he turned around, he sees the emergency exit, he starts running for the emergency exit. Just before he got to the door, motherfucking Puff Daddy from Bad Boy Records jumped in front of the door. That n*gga was like, “Eh-eh, eh-eh.” Boy… Puffy got that motherfucker. Then every celebrity ran out ’cause every celebrity saw themselves in me, and they started beating the fuck out of that kid. And I know Chris was backstage looking like, “Nobody helped me.” ♪ Everybody Hates Chris! ♪ Look, it was way more intense than what you guys might have read. I don’t know what you read, but the kid, while we was beating on him, reached in his waistband, pulled out 22-caliber pistol. That shit was mayhem. Everybody started screaming, “Oh, my God, he’s got a gun.” And then I got scared. I was in the back, but I was scared. ‘Cause I knew that everybody that was with me, was armed. Yes, if they had shot and killed this kid on stage at the Hollywood Bowl… like I pay you to do, Travis… But Travis G-ed up. Travis wrestled the gun out of the kid’s hand. Then he took it like this and tried to chamber the round and he couldn’t. So he pulled the trigger and it wasn’t a gun. A knife blade popped out of the front. I guess this kid was going to stab me. That’s some scary shit. So the next night, even though I didn’t have a show, I said, “I got to get back on stage.” I went and did a show. And someone in the audience screamed out, “Dave, what happened with the attack?” And I didn’t know there was a journalist in the room. All I said was that this n*gga had a knife that identified as a gun. I got six more weeks of bad press for that joke. I didn’t even do nothing to this n*gga. That’s not right. That was not right. And then the New York Post went to the jail and interviewed my attacker like he was some kind of hero. And I read that interview. It turns out the entire attack was my fault. Yes, I triggered him. I didn’t mean to. I had done jokes about the homeless. It turns out… this young man was homeless. And, I mean, there’s no way I could’ve known this. But I will say… for a homeless guy, this n*gga had incredible seats… Oh, and they said I triggered them because I had done LBGTQ jokes. And it turns out this fellow was a B. That was the headline in the article that said, “Dave Chappelle’s',\n",
              "  \" alleged attacker is bisexual.” I said, “alleged attacker”? This motherfucker definitely attacked me. I’ll show you the tape. He’s allegedly bisexual. I’ll need to see him suck somebody’s dick before I believe the rest of this article… I read that shit in the paper. I was horrified. I was like, “Bisexual? I could have been raped!” No. You know what, though? It’s not funny because… Because after all that madness ensued, I went to the hotel room. I was by myself, and I opened the door, and my wife was in there alone. She was sobbing. Like sobbing. I said, “My God, what’s wrong with you? Bitch, did you get attacked, too?” And she’s crying. She said, “Oh, my God, Dave.” She said, “If you had died tonight… me and the kids would have nothing.” Then I knew it was serious. So I sat down on the bed next to her. I reached in my pocket, I pulled some keys out that she’d never seen before. She’s like, “Oh!” “What are those keys?” And I gently placed them in her hands. I said, “Sweetheart, those are the keys to my safe deposit box. God forbid anything ever happen to me. But if it does, don’t even worry about it. You and the kids have everything you need in that box. I’ve already taken care of it.” And she was looking at them keys. And I could see her mind realize what we were actually talking about. And then she just started crying harder. And to be honest with you, that made me cry a little bit, too. And we hugged each other real tight. Do you know this bitch looked in the box while I’m alive and well? Who does that? Oh, my God. And then she was mad at me. She said, “Goddamn it, David. I opened that box.” I said, “You did?” She said, “Yes, I did, and there was nothing in there.” I said, “Nothing?” She said, “Nothing except your stupid joke book.” I was like, “Phew.” I said, “Well, sweetie, look. If you tell those jokes exactly how they’re written, you and the kids should be fine. They’re really good jokes.” She’s like, “Good jokes? What is this shit?” “‘Come join me in my watery grave.'” No. You gotta roll your throat. [trilling voice] Come join me in my watery grave. Oh, boy. Oh, boy. I have been married a long time. I have. You know, I talk a lot of shit about my wife, but I love her very much. In fact, you know, you guys wouldn’t believe this about me. I’m a jealous husband. It’s true. Let me tell you something. One time I thought my wife was cheating on me. Yes, n*gga. Yes. That was one of the worst days of my fucking life. I couldn’t take it. And I’m embarrassed about it now, but I can talk about it. You know what I did? It’s fucked up. But I did do this. I waited. I waited for her to fall asleep. And I waited a long time. She’s Asian. I couldn’t tell if she was asleep or not. I was looking at her… And when I wa\",\n",
              "  's sure she was asleep, you know what I did? I stole the iPhone. Took it downstairs, started trying out passwords to see if I could open it. I couldn’t figure out the password. Then I remembered, it’s an iPhone. This shit has facial recognition. I was just like… And that shit opened right up… And I saw a text message in there from a fellow named Earl. I don’t know anybody named Earl. I woke her up out of her sleep. I said, “Wake the fuck up! Who the fuck is Earl?” She said, “What are you talking about?” “Don’t you play dumb with me, bitch!” “I done open your phone. Who is Earl?” She’s like, “Oh, my God, David.” “That’s gay Earl from the hair salon.” I said, “Word. What am I, a dummy? How am I supposed to know this n*gga is gay?” And she was calm. She said, “Read his texts and look at his pictures.” I started reading them texts. Hmm. “This fellow sure does spell girl with a ‘u’ a lot.” And I switched over and looked at his pictures and I couldn’t believe it. This fellow looked gay in still pictures. His mouth was open in every shot. And then I knew she was telling the truth. And then I felt, like, dumb. I said, “I’m sorry. I’m sorry. Okay? I’m sorry. Here. Take your phone. I’m sorry. Just go back to sleep. I am sorry. I just… I guess I’ve just been insecure ’cause of all this cheating I’ve been doing. Good night.” She didn’t let me leave. Said, “Since you wanna wake a bitch up…” Then she pulled my phone from under her pillow. I said, “What the fuck?” She said, “Who is this bitch in this picture?” I said, “How’d you open that phone?” She said, “Easy. All I had to do was mash my nose and go like this, and it opened right up.” I said, “What the fuck?” She said, “Who is this bitch?” I said, “Give me that. Girl, relax. That ain’t no bitch. This is my friend. Deborah.” I’m gonna close the night with a long story. Do you mind? All right. It’s a long one. So pretend that I’ve finished. ‘Cause I gotta go get a cigarette. All right? I’m not done, but just act like it. I’d prefer standing ovations since we’re acting. Thank you very much. Good night. Thanks for not giving me a standing O, motherfuckers. This is the worst. It’s all right. I just wanted to smoke. You like that, don’t you? Okay. Before I did Killin’ Them Softly, when I was 22, HBO gave me the biggest opportunity of my life at that time. They gave me a half-hour special, but this shit was not like a special, you know what I mean? It was like, generic. It didn’t even have a title. It just says “Dave Chappelle.” And I shot it in San Francisco, at a place called Broadway Studios, which is on the second floor of a building. And beneath Broadway Studios is a nightclub. And the special was only supposed to be 30 minutes. And I got ready. I practiced. I did all t',\n",
              "  'he shit I was supposed to do. And the night that I taped, 20 minutes into my 30-minute set, I’ll never forget this music. Music started blasting from the nightclub underneath. You could hear it real loud and it fucked my whole show up, and I was devastated. I was a young man. I really believed in what I was doing. And I thought that my dream had been killed. So when I got off stage, I ran down the steps to the alley behind Broadway Studios, where the control trucks are parked, and I kicked that motherfucking door open. And I started yelling at all the producers. I was nobody in show business. Just a guy that believed in myself. I said, “Man, you fucked everything up.” “That fucking music. What the fuck were you thinking?” And there was a guy who was a big-time producer. I ain’t saying no names. He stood up and he said, “Hey, kid, sit the fuck down.” He said, “We didn’t ruin anything.” He said, “We made a deal with that nightclub to not play music, and they didn’t honor the deal.” And I said, “Who didn’t honor the deal?” And he pointed to a guy. I’ll never forget it. It was an old white man sitting in a Ford Taurus by himself. And he said, “That guy right there.” I didn’t waste no time or ask no questions. I went to that Ford Taurus and I beat on that window, I said, “Open the door, motherfucker. I want to talk to you.” That old man looked at me for one second and wisely drove the fuck off. And left me in the alley cussing at anybody who would listen. And two minutes later, literally 120 seconds later, it couldn’t have been any more than that, the doors of the kitchen in the alley of that nightclub underneath Broadway Studios swung open. And that old man was standing there, that same old man with reinforcements. He had two big goons with him, and he looked at me… He was calm as a cucumber. He said, “You, come here. I want to talk to you.” I didn’t know anything about streets at this age. But I found out later in my life that these men were Russian mobsters. I don’t know what you guys know about the Russian mob, but these are the n*ggas that killed Denzel in Training Day. All the producers knew what I was up against. They said, “Dave, do not go in there.” And I said, “Fuck y’all.” And I walked right into that kitchen and they closed the doors behind me, and it got the dark as fuck in there, and I knew. I’m not dumb. I knew I was in a bad situation. But you have to understand, I believed in what I was doing, and I didn’t give a fuck. Just kept cussing at these motherfuckers. Tell them how they ruined my life. And that old man couldn’t believe that I was talking all of this shit. And as soon as I took a breath, he stopped me gently. He said, “Hey, kid, listen. Your friends lied to you.” He said. “We made a de',\n",
              "  \"al. But your friends never paid me.” And when he said that, I realized I was locked in a kitchen. I realized he was telling the truth, which would make me wrong. And the moment, the very moment that I realized I was wrong, for the first time, I was afraid. You see, it’s a funny thing if you believe you’re absolutely right. You can get drunk off the feeling of how right you are. That’s why gay people are so mean… But I didn’t buckle. You guys would’ve been very proud of me. I was scared, but I didn’t buckle. I said, “Well, then, sir, I owe you an apology. But I believe that no matter what reason that music was playing, it ruined my life.” And that old man looked at me with sympathy in his eyes. And he walked over to me and he gently placed his hand on my cheek. Which I gotta tell you, it is a very emasculating thing to do. I was standing there looking at this n*gga’s hand on my cheek, like… And he said, “You are a real man.” And he tapped me on my cheek. Real soft. And just like that, the doors open back up. The light from the alley flooded into the kitchen, and I just walked out alive. I lived to fight… another day. And in that moment, I learned one of the most valuable lessons of my life, and I have to share it with you. And that lesson is this. In your life, at any given moment, the strongest dream in that moment wins that moment. I am a very powerful dreamer. Yeah, I’m not lying. I dreamed tonight, this very night, as a 14-year-old boy, and I am living it as a 50-year-old man. My dreams are very strong. Today, I walked all around Washington. I used to be poor in this city, and all day, people just said, “Hey, Dave. Hey, Dave.” Like they knew me personally, and I felt like I knew them. And I say to myself, “My God, Dave, what a powerful dream.” But then, sometimes… Sometimes… I feel regular. I just feel like myself. Maybe I’ll smoke some weed and be at some nightclub and feel shy. But I’ll look across the nightclub, see some guy that no one’s ever heard of. But this n*gga worked all week and got bottle service, and this bitch is bringing Moët and sparklers to ’em. I picture, in my mind, he’s Persian. He’s doing some kind of weird Persian dance. He got six bitches at his table because he got so much liquor. And they all just saying, “Go Cena! Go Cena!” And I was looking across the room like, “Oh, my God. I’m in that guy’s dream.” I can hear him telling his friends. “Hey, how was the club last night?” “That shit was fantastic. I had bottle service. I seen Dave Chappelle across the club, looking at me like, ‘Who is that?'” And that’s the trick to life. You have to be wise enough to know when you were living in your dream. And you have to be humble enough to accept when you’re in someone else’s. That’s why…\",\n",
              "  ' That’s why I don’t judge between Will Smith, and Chris Rock. Because you guys look at them as big ideas, but I look at them as fellow dreamers. I can’t judge between them because I see myself in both of them. I am Will Smith. I am the man that cannot take it anymore and will slap the shit out of the next person that says a cross word to me or somebody that I love. And I am Chris Rock. I am the man that can get slapped in front of the whole world and keep my composure so I don’t fuck anything up. T hat… is what… men do. Men make boundaries. Men enforce boundaries. And men tests boundaries. And no man test more boundaries than a trans man… When I see a fellow dreamer, I give them my utmost respect, even if I don’t understand what their dream is. I know a dreamer when I see one. And I’ve met many powerful dreamers in my life. None more powerful than a man who calls himself… Lil Nas X. I met this n*gga at a party. I had no idea who he was. But the minute he walked in that party, I knew I was in his dream. Everybody in the party was another dreamer. Everyone was famous. But when that n*gga walked in, he was dressed like C-3PO. He was shining. And everyone was like, “Oh, my God, there he is. That’s Lil Nas X!” I didn’t know who he was. For some reason, out of all of them dreamers, he walked right up to me. And he said, “I tried to get you in my video.” I didn’t know what the fuck he was talking about. I said, “What?” “What video?” And he was just looking at me like… “You know what video,” and walked away. And I watched him walk away. I said, “Man.” I said… “This n*gga’s having a very powerful dream.” You know what it reminded me of? It remind me of when we was in grade school. Remember, the teacher would ask everybody what they want to be. “Timmy. Timmy, what do you want to be when you grow up?” Timmy acted like he had an idea. He’d stand up and he’d say, “I want to be a fireman.” And the teacher would say, “Timmy, that is a beautiful dream.” But Timmy didn’t mean it. Timmy said he wanted to be a fireman because deep down, Timmy is attracted to fire. And by the time he’s 14 years old, this n*gga is a full-blown pyromaniac, playing with kerosene and matches like a goddamn expert. Then one night he goes downtown with his buddies fucking around with fire, burns a warehouse down. He doesn’t know it, but there’s 13 migrant workers from El Salvador in that motherfucker. They get trapped and then they die in the fire. Isn’t that a tragedy? Well, it was an accident. He’s only 14 years old. But he’s Black. So they try him as an adult. Timmy ends up spending the rest of his life in jail. Dream deferred. [mimics buzzer sound] “What about you, Billy? Billy? Billy, What do you want to be when you grow up?” Billy stands up ',\n",
              "  'and he says, “I want to be president of the United States.” And the teacher says, “Oh, my God, Billy. Billy, that is a wonderful dream.” And Billy means that shit. Billy does everything right. That motherfucker gets his grades up, he joins student government. He even does extracurricular activities like show choir just to make his resume look good. He’s on track to be president. But junior year, he wipes. When he’s 16, he gets his girlfriend pregnant, and has to drop out of high school to make ends meet. But lucky for him, the local Walmart’s hiring. By the time he’s 20 years old, this motherfucker makes assistant manager at Walmart. He’s the youngest one in the district. He says, “Oh, my God, if I can keep this up for four more years, I could be a manager. If I can keep this up for six more years after that, I could even be a regional manager and have as many as three Walmarts under my control.” And he’s a big-picture guy. He sees where this path is going. So he kills himself. [mimics buzzer sound] “What about you? What do you want to be when you grow up?” “I don’t wanna say. Because I don’t want the other kids to laugh at me.” “Who cares if they laugh? Your dream is yours. Own your dreams so they can come true. Say it loud and proud. What do you want to be when you grow up, Lil Nas X?” That n*gga stood up in front of the whole class. “I want to be the gayest n*gga that ever lived. I want to do a music video, slide down a stripper pole, all the way to the depths of hell, and suck the devil’s dick at ten o’clock on BET while all the kids are awake and can see me.” Shockingly, that was the only dream that worked out. That’s why I’m here. Tonight. In the city where I built the dreams that I live. ‘Cause I wanted to tell you all that they came true. And I wanted to thank you all for making the man that I am today. Yes, I am living a very powerful dream. Every time I come to this city and I stand in front of you, I realize that, “My God, man, this is not my dream at all. It’s yours, and I am honored to be in it.” Thank you very much, Washington D.C.

              " ['(EMOTIONAL MUSIC PLAYING) (MUSIC ENDS) DREW MICHAEL: It’s nice to see you people. I have a hard time with people, so here we go. (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING) Well, it’s always been hard for me to connect with people throughout my whole life, and I think there’s, you know, a lot of reasons for that. Um, I have a hearing loss that I’ve had since I was a kid. When I was three years old… I failed a hearing test. I took a hearing test and the doctor said, “You failed the hearing test.” Well, I didn’t know what he said, but… (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING) …he said something, and my parents got upset, so I assumed I didn’t nail it, and… So he told my parents, he said, “This kid needs hearing aids.” And so instead of doing that, they didn’t. So we just… (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING) …coasted until I was 21. I didn’t wear them till I was 21. I wore them for like a week when I was in fifth grade, but then this girl I had a crush on asked about them. She’s like, “What’s in your ear?” I was like, “Well, that’s the end of that forever.” (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING) “So I’ll figure… I’ll figure it out.” It instilled this kinda sense of shame in me. You know, I took it as something was wrong with me. I put it on myself. I go, “I must be fucked up.” And then I’m like, “No, my doctor fucked up.” And then my friends were like, “No, dude, your parents, your parents fucked up.” And it’s like, “Oh, cool, well, add it to their tab.” Like, I don’t know… (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING) They got a long tab running, you know. Also, they got divorced when I was 12, which is, like, the most “fuck you” age you could possibly… (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING) Like, you guys weren’t, like, killing it when I was five. You couldn’t have done it then? You had to wait until I was 12? They did do the thing where they… This is a common thing I think parents do when they get divorced, they tell their kids… They told me, “It’s not your fault. Don’t worry, it’s not your fault.” It’s like, “Yeah, first of all, I wasn’t thinking that. Uh… I don’t know why you thought I thought it was on me. Have you seen you guys? Mom is cripplingly insecure, and Dad’s addicted to prostitutes. On what fucking world is this on me?” (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING) I didn’t have a good blueprint… for what a relationship should look like, so, you know, I’ve struggled accordingly. I’ve had issues in relationships. There’s other reasons for that, too. Like it can’t be a good thing… (CHUCKLES) It can’t be a good thing that the first… 2,000… sexual experiences of my life… (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING) …were with a Dell computer. Like that can’t be… (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) It can’t be helping. It can’t be pushing me in the right direction on this pursuit of love and happiness that I’m on. Two thousand. That’s the number, by the way. I didn’t, like, write down a funny number for you. I counted. (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING) It’s literally 2,000, age 12 to 19 was exclusively that every single day. I bought a computer for my family with my bar mitzvah money, and then I fucked it for seven years straight. (AUDIENCE LAUGHING, APPLAUDING) That’s how I began. That is the origin story to my sexual identity, just downloading sexist shit into my head. Then waltzing out into the world like, “Oh, yeah, I totally respect people.” How? How is that even possible? It’s so corrosive. That shit will rot your brain. And it’s certainly, for a young boy, like, it’s insane. Even now, it’s like… We like to pretend like it’s fine, but that’s on',\n",
              "  'ly because we don’t have to acknowledge what it is that we’re doing. It’s like this virtual, wordless escapade. You never have to be accountable for what it is you’re doing. I think before… you’re allowed to click on a video… you should have to say the title out loud. (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) How badly do you want this? I feel like most people are like, “I’m just gonna call my mom and reconnect… the person I need to be.” (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING) And it’s bled in. Yeah, my relationship dynamics have always been somewhat turbulent. A lot of back and forth, break up, get back together kind of things. A lot of things that start really quickly. It’s like immediate intensity, you know? Because usually I feel like shit about myself and they feel like shit about themselves, and we come together and we’re like, “Well, we have each other. And we can do all this stuff! We can do all this stuff together now that we’re both here. We can rub each other’s heads. We can take naps together. We can, like, slow dance in the kitchen while we’re waiting for our cookies to finish baking.” How specific do you want me to get? (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING) But then when I have all that stuff, I’m able to see, I’m like, “Oh, this is a very codependent relationship, this isn’t healthy. This isn’t the kind of thing I wanna be in long term. You’re not the person that’s right for me.” So I’ll be like, “Maybe we should break up.” But then they leave, they take all the stuff! I’m like, “I wanna break up with you, but you should love me still. Like, you should still give me all the things, just don’t ask me for anything.” (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING) Like, “I need you. Like, this is all built off of the back of you. Like, your love for me gave me the confidence to even feel like I could break up with you.” (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) “I never would’ve broken up with you if I was by myself.” (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) But it’s a self-esteem thing. I don’t feel… I don’t feel, like, good enough for the person that I… that would be right for me, you know? So, what if… I play this in my head. What it feels like I need to do is I need to find a girlfriend, uh, in order to be confident enough to be the type of person that I would need to be in order to attract the girl that I actually want to be with. (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING) On my own, I’m nothing, but in a relationship, I’m kind of a catch. (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) (CHUCKLES) I feel like this is a common phenomenon, that love at first sight, that idea, it gets propagated. We all know what you mean by it, “love at first sight.” And it’s something that’s a really enchanting idea, you know? ‘Cause you’re like, you know, one minute you’re alone, the next minute you’ve found the one. It’s like, “What a… What a day.” (CHUCKLES) (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING) What a day that would be. And so it’s so enticing, but I’ve seen… I’ve gone that route so many times, I know what’s on the back end of it, so it’s hard for me not to be cynical about it. Now when I hear people like, “We knew right away…” Did you? ‘Cause now anytime I hear someone say about their own relationship, “We knew right away,” all I hear is, “We were both abandoned as children.” (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) You knew right away? Your threshold for loving a person is you saw them once? That seems like a low bar to clear. (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING) I feel like maybe you can’t handle the anxiety of uncertainty, so you went from zero to 100 right away to skip over that prosp',\n",
              "  'ect of rejection and the risk that they might not be who you imagine them to be. Am I close? Am I fucking close? -Like, I feel like that… (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) …is a more accurate characterization of what we’re talking about. If you’re drawn to somebody that quickly, that strongly, that intensely, that immediately, that’s not love. You probably have unresolved trauma. (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING) And the other person probably represents an embodiment of the trigger of that trauma, so you’re drawn to them in this misguided attempt to retroactively fix a fucked-up period in your past. That’s not love! Don’t call that love. Don’t rebrand that as love and make the rest of us feel bad. Don’t be out in the world like, “It was love at first sight.” Say something honest like, “It was ‘I felt the way I did when my dad left’ at first sight.” (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) I’ll believe that. I’ll believe that, yeah. “My husband’s face looks just like the back of my father’s head, so I chased it…” (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) “…to now.” (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING) You should not be chasing. Don’t chase. Love should not be chased. (GASPS) You shouldn’t have that, like, “Are we gonna make it?” (CHUCKLES) No! (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) If you’re wondering, no. You should not be chasing. Like in movies, like, to propagate this idea, “chase them,” and that rom-com fantasy of chasing someone to an airport. Chase a therapist to an airport. Like, don’t… Like, “Don’t leave, we have so much work to do!” Like, that’s… (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING) (CHUCKLES) No, ’cause movies have to show you… They can’t show you what love actually is. We don’t wanna see it. Love isn’t entertaining. They have to show some dramatic, conflicted version of love. They don’t… We don’t wanna see love, actual love. It’s beautiful. I’m not shitting on the sentiment. It’s an amazing thing between the two people. It’s not fun to watch. Think about a couple you know, maybe you are that couple, who are truly in love, in love, like, together, good, healthy. We don’t wanna watch that. Like, if you wanna… If you… (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING) If you watched a movie about a couple in love, you would just be on your couch watching a couple on their couch, watching a better movie. (AUDIENCE LAUGHING, APPLAUDING) You’re like, “Why… What are they watching? I’ll just watch that. Why don’t we cut out… cut out the middleman? I don’t need…” (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING) AUDIENCE MEMBER: Oh, my God. That’s not what they show you. ‘Cause we don’t wanna see… We don’t wanna see healthy, good love. We wanna see, like, a manifestation of, like, our own internal dramas played out… for entertainment value. The problem is there are people out there, like when I was a kid, who are like empty canvases, who internalized that. And so it starts to skew their view of what love could be. Like, people who don’t have a healthy blueprint are gonna absorb that and take that in. You know, I was 12 years old when the movie Titanic came out, and that was, like, iconic love story. Like, here it is, epic love, cruelly interrupted by fate. And I look at that movie now, I’m like, “Wait, what were we rooting for here? What did we want to happen? For them to get to New York? They weren’t gonna make it as a couple.” What did we think? They’re 20 years old, they’ve known each other two days. I don’t know everything about relationships, but like, hey, maybe don’t marry the artist you fucked on a cruise. (AUDIENCE LAUGHING, APPLA',\n",
              "  'UDING) Maybe that’s not the move. Five minutes after you tried to kill yourself. Do you remember that’s how they met? She was trying to kill herself by jumping off the boat, and he was like, “Hey, I’m pretty hot. What if you didn’t do that?” And so… (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) That’s how they started. They knew right away. Like, that’s the thing, is like, what happens? How is that gonna play out? Even if they get to New York, what? -They have nothing in common. (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING) You know what I mean? Like, all they have is the excitement that they made it. That lasts, what? Six months, a year… two years, maybe? What happens five, ten years down the road? Just sittin’ there. He’s like, “So… you want me to draw you?” She’s like, “Fuck you!” (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) “I was engaged to a billionaire. I had to sell that necklace to pay the heating bill. You haven’t sold a sketch in years, Jack. How’s that art gallery going, Jack?” He’s like, “Oh, come on. Remember when we danced -with the common folk?” (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) Terrible. It would’ve been terrible. People are like, “Oh, it’s so sad what happened. If they didn’t hit the iceberg…” Fuck that! The iceberg is the hero of that movie. (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) It might’ve killed Jack, but it saved the rest of Rose’s life. (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) I like movies, I do. I do. I don’t like movie culture, though, like Hollywood… like the culture surrounding it. And every time I get roped into watching an award show, I’m always reminded, like, who the fuck makes these things. It’s like, “Oh, my God.” You ever watch an award show? It’s like this shouldn’t be on television. This should be, like… like, in an underground cave at Bohemian Grove. Like, why is this in front of the public? ‘Cause they try to act like they’re down-to-earth. Every time an actor wins an award, they always give some… It’s not some, like, normal speech, it’s like a lofty, sociopolitical response to the moment. It’s like, “We need to find a way. There’s a lot of problems in the world. We need to find a way to come together and not let it divide us.” Like Meryl Streep, “We need to come together.” (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING) “Find unity and strength, and break down the barriers that keep us apart. -And find strength and unity.” (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING) “Come together as a globe, as a nation, as a people.” I’m always like, “Yeah, uh, you’re wearing a diamond dress from Givenchy.” Like, on what fucking planet are you part of “the people”? (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING) Like, what do you think? Like, if there was a true people’s revolution, like a people’s uprising, it’s gonna be your blood -splattered on the sidewalk. (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING) They’re not gonna spare you ’cause they liked Devil Wears Prada. They’re gonna rip your fucking head off, stick it on a stake, and sell that diamond dress to a cartel for machine guns. (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) They’re not gonna be like, “Oh, get in the bunker. We love the nuance of your artistic choices. It was so brave of you, how you dared, oh, how you dared to be a middle-class character.” Like, “Oh, how you pretended to be a thing people are their entire lives. How did you do it? How did you prepare for the role?” And they’re always like, “Oh, I lived amongst plumbers -for eight months.” (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) “I lived how they lived. I ate how they ate.” (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING) No, that’s it, you can’t. You can’t preach togetherness and unity when you’re that rich. You j',\n",
              "  'ust can’t do it. You’re rich. You’re super rich. That’s why you got rich, is to get the fuck away from everybody. (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING) That’s what money is. Money is just an escape from people. That’s why we want it. Everything money does for you. Doesn’t even have to be a lot of money. You’d be like, “Ooh, I can afford an Uber.” What’s an Uber? That is a bus for one person. (AUDIENCE LAUGHING, APPLAUDING) It’s like, “Yeah, I like the bus. I just wish there were no people on it and it only went where I want it to go.” (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) Yeah, you can do that. You gotta pay for it. You wanna join a gym, there’s different kinds of gyms, right? There’s a whole spectrum of gym options. There’s a ten-dollar-a-month gym on one end. Two-hundred-dollar-a-month gym on the other end. What’s the difference? Two-hundred-dollar-a-month gym, it’s nicer. It’s not 20 times nicer. It’s not like the ten-dollar-a-month gym, the walls are falling off, and you pick up the ten-pound weight and it’s 100 pounds. You’re like, “Oh, fuck this gym! The dumbbells are Gatorade bottles filled with rocks, this gym sucks.” (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) No, there’s still equipment there. The 200-dollar-a-month gym, you pay 200 dollars a month so you don’t have to look at people who can only afford ten dollars a month. (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) That’s what you’re paying for. You wanna be able to do a pull-up without being reminded of the dark underbelly of capitalism. (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING) It’s a 190-dollar surcharge to not have to make eye contact with the consolation prize in this fucked-up game we’re all playing here. That’s what you’re paying for. That’s the premium. Everything money does for you just pushes you further and further away from everybody else. You wanna fly, you buy a plane ticket. First-class ticket, way more expensive. Why? There’s less people up there. They won’t tell you that. They’ll be like, “No, you get more space.” It’s like, yeah, motherfucker, space is just the absence of people. (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) It’s not a new entity. Space is a euphemism for not anybody. “No, you get all this legroom.” Yeah, ’cause they’re no people in the way of where my legs are trying to go. We could all have legroom back here if we weren’t all back here. (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) Now, could you imagine if two people in economy class were, like, fighting over the armrest, and some asshole from first class came back and was like, “Hey! We need to all work together. We need to find unity and strength as a flight. We’re all flight 348, after all.” Then they swoosh the curtain and go back to their apartment in the sky. How quickly before the back rows start bundling their plastic silverware together to storm the front? (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) Like, “No, no, we’re not trying to hijack the plane, we’re just trying to kill rows one through five. Take their hot towels and orange juice and spread it around.” (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING) That’s the fantasy. Everyone fantasizes about what they would do when they get rich. You wanna get away from everybody. Nobody fantasizes about togetherness. Nobody’s like, “Oh, dude, if I got rich… (CHUCKLES) I would get so many roommates.” (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) “Oh, it’d be sick, we’d have like a dishes schedule.” (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING) No, the fantasy is, “I’m gonna build a moat around my house. People aren’t gonna be able to ring my doorbell without swimming across a crocodile-laden river.” (AUDIENCE CHUCKL',\n",
              "  'ING) Fuck everybody. And I got nothing against rich people. You just can’t have it both ways. You can’t bridge class with a speech. You can’t have it all and then have this, like, faux empathy. Like, “Aww… it’s so sad, people don’t have any money.” It’s like, “Well, you seem to have it.” (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING) “Try giving it away. You don’t have to have it.” And these phony causes, every Thanksgiving, one of them comes out with, like, “It’s so terrible what happened to the Native Americans.” It’s like, “Fucking, I don’t know, give ’em the land back.” (AUDIENCE APPLAUDING, CHEERING) (CHUCKLES SARCASTICALLY) “No.” (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) “We can’t do that. Where would we put the offices of DoorDash?” (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) (CHUCKLES) I swear to God, these fucking… Like North America could be, like, falling into the ocean. We could all be killing each other over grain seeds and fresh water. These people would be like on Mars, -tweeting, “Stop the violence.” (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING) “Love is stronger than hate.” And changing their profile picture to a blue circle to show they still care about Earth. (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) Going on Jimmy Fallon to promote it, like, “Yeah, we’re changing our profile pictures to blue circles to raise Earth awareness.” Jimmy’s just like, “Oh, my God, it’s genius. Such a good idea.” (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) “Oh, my God, how’d you think of it? It’s so important. You’re doing such important work.” (LAUGHS SARCASTICALLY) (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) “Oh, my God, it’s…” (LAUGHS SARCASTICALLY) (AUDIENCE APPLAUDING) (LAUGHS SARCASTICALLY) (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING) Jimmy Fallon. I’m sorry, is there a more Guy Smiley, useless, puppet fuck of a person… (AUDIENCE APPLAUDING, CHEERING) …than Jimmy Fallon? Professional napkin. Like how the fuck? (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING) (GIGGLES SARCASTICALLY) Dude, I used to think Leno said nothing. Fallon makes Leno look like Malcolm X. (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) Like, “Oh, yeah.” (BABBLES INCOMPREHENSIBLY) I’ll never get asked to do the show, but… (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) (CHUCKLES) I… I would wanna do it just one time, just to be like, “Hey, Jimmy, what do you not like?” (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING) “What… Is there anything… Do you have a hard stance on fucking anything?” (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) He’d be like, “Oh, my God, it’s such a cool take.” (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) (GIGGLES) “I don’t know, I… I just kinda float around. I have no discretion, yet I’m hugely influential. Culture’s a joke.” (LAUGHS MOCKINGLY) (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING) “Every time I speak, I mean less to myself. I’m murdering my identity up here.” (LAUGHS SARCASTICALLY) “It’s genius.” (LAUGHS) Shut up! Shut the fuck up! Like you could literally… You could put a gun in his mouth and… (MIMICS GUNSHOT) …blow his head off and he’d be like, “Oh, my God, my brains are on the wall! It’s so cool!” (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) “How’d you do that?” He’s a horror movie villain. You can’t kill him. His weapon is just effusive nothingness. He just keeps coming. (SCREECHES) “Come back! Don’t you wanna play truth or dare with Ariana Grande?” (LAUGHS SARCASTICALLY) (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING, APPLAUDING) Nice. (SIGHS) Look, I just think if entertainment is gonna be this ubiquitous, it can’t be this devoid of humanity. It just can’t. It… You know, ’cause I grew up, entertainment was important to me. And so, you know, I looked to it for something, and to be that devoid of substance, it feels… insulting. The problem with entertainment is that it’s all ma',\n",
              "  'de… by the same type of person. It’s made by entertainers. Right? So it’s like… Entertainers are psychotic. (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING) Like, just statistically. So, look at this room right now. Almost everybody in the room is sitting nicely, looking at this, and only one person is like, “Heh, heh, my thoughts.” (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) “My thoughts.” And after this is over, you’ll go home to your respectable lives. And I’ll try to find another place to do, “My thoughts.” (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING) “Soon I’ll be full.” (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING) So you have to consider the source, right? I think about that with all media. Social media, for example, like, you know… You look at like Twitter or something like that, it’s like… Like Twitter… Who’s on Twitter? It’s just… It’s only people who think it’s like a good idea -to be on Twitter. Like… (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING) It’s not everybody. It pretends to be everybody, like, “Ooh, everyone’s mad.” You look at the trending topics, “Ooh, what’s everyone talking about?” It’s not. Most people aren’t on it. Eighty percent of the public doesn’t use it. Ninety percent, I think, doesn’t use it regularly. So, like, what’s trending? Like… Most people aren’t there, so what’s really trending is shutting the fuck up. Like, most people… (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING) Most people are doing that, but you can’t register that. You can’t show somebody not tweeting. Like you can’t… They should show how much we don’t tweet also. They should show like a tweet, and then you scroll through blank space for like seven hours. (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) And then you come across another tweet. You’d be like, “This is a barren wasteland for lunatics.” (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING) Everyone on Twitter is somebody on Twitter. There’s an inherent insanity in the medium. Right? It’s the same reason I can’t trust Yelp. (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING) Every time I look at Yelp, I read a Yelp review, I’m like, “Yeah, but this person wrote a Yelp review.” (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) “Why am I listening to a person who logged in to write three paragraphs on broccoli rabe?” (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) Everyone on Yelp is someone on Yel… Every Yelp review starts with someone going, “I’m gonna write a Yelp review.” Like, fuck whoever that person is. But that’s everyone on Yelp. Everyone on Yelp is someone who uses Yelp. Everyone on Twitter is someone who uses Twitter. I want a social media site where the only way to use it is to not. Like, I don’t wanna hear the thoughts that you want me to think that you think. I wanna hear what you think. I wanna hear what you don’t even let yourself think you think. You know those thoughts? You ever have like a fucking crazy thought that bubbles up, and you push it away, you’re like, “Didn’t think it! Didn’t think it. Still a good person. Didn’t… ‘Cause I didn’t think it all the way. I didn’t finish the thought that I clearly started, so somehow that’s not me.” (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING) I want those. I want you to cut open your heart and dump it into my brain. Intimacy is what I’m looking for. Which is not… I shouldn’t go to social media for intimacy, you can’t get it. You ever see someone try to be intimate on social media? -It’s fucking terrible. (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING) It doesn’t work. It never works, ’cause it doesn’t have the language for intimacy. ‘Cause intimacy is amorphous. It doesn’t come with a character limit, or a soundtrack, or filter, it’s just… (GRUNTS) The language of social media, is like, snark an',\n",
              "  'd division and attacks and clapbacks and, “Oh, that? Oh, clearly you don’t even know about this.” (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) That rises. That gets a lot of attention. But we’re all, like, fucked up, right? It’s like very confusing, and there’s a big market right now for certainty. Anyone who has an answer, even if it’s the wrong one, is in demand. That’s why you get this whole rash of people who garner these followings, ’cause they’re giving people a narrative. All these like, you know, podcast hosts, demagogue type, usually a white dude who’s like, “Hey, the media and the government are all lying to you, but you know who’s not?” (LAUGHS MOCKINGLY) “Me!” (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING) “Me, the guy trying to sell you CBD oil and sex toys every 30 minutes. I’m your beacon of truth. Wear me, listen to me.” This is collective narcissism. It’s changed the way we think, like the way we process our own language, like how we sound. I remember in the ’16 election, they were talking about the Rock maybe running for president, and I said that to a friend, I was like, “Yo, I heard the Rock might run for president.” My buddy was like, “Is the Rock a Democrat?” And I was like, “Dude, listen to the sentence…” (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) “…that you just said. Is the Rock a Democrat? I don’t know. He’s a fake wrestling character. I don’t know where he stands on healthcare.” Is the Rock a Democrat? I don’t know. Did the Yellow Power Ranger support the war in Iraq? What the fuck are we talking about? (AUDIENCE LAUGHING, APPLAUDING) Where does Mickey Mouse stand on abortion? I don’t know. Is he a “second trimester or before” kind of mouse, or more like a hardline… (IN HIGH-PITCHED VOICE) “Life begins at conception, folks.” Like, I don’t know what Mickey thinks. Does Mickey think, or does he just do whatever the artist makes him do? Is there a consciousness in Mickey? Do any of us think, or are we just being guided by an unseen hand? Is thinking part of the illusion? Is Descartes a fraud? This is why I had to get off of Twitter. I existentially spiral. I lose who I am. I did, I deleted my Twitter a year ago. I still have Instagram because I’m stupid. (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING) Instagram is… It’s like hell. It’s just like hell. You can download hell to your phone for free. (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) It’s free. Hell is free. Instagram is just like, “Hey… uh, are you not feeling jealous today?” (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) “Come hang out. Look, there’s a beer, some food you’ll never eat. Go fuck yourself. We hate you. We are trying to tear you down. We don’t give a fuck. Here’s places you’ll never go. Here’s a person that will never fuck you. Go fuck yourself. We hate you.” “We are manipulating your emotions, and then monitoring them so we can sell you shit. You want a bracelet? Yeah, we knew you would, motherfucker.” Literally. Literally! Literally. People are like, “What do those bracelets mean?” They mean I’m a fucking moron! (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING) They mean I was depressed and got a targeted ad and thought these bracelets would turn it all around. (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) That’s what they mean. “You are nothing. We have hollowed you out and emptied you and filled you with ourselves and the desire for more. You are powerless against it. This is a takeover. Didn’t happen the way it did in Terminator. It’s a lot more subtle, with more cat videos and 14-year-olds twerking. Is that a crime? Ha, ha. We’ll never tell you.” (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) I',\n",
              "  ' hate it. It makes me feel like shit. The only social media site that I like… is, uh, Venmo. (AUDIENCE LAUGHING, APPLAUDING) That’s right. I like Venmo. Venmo’s a money transfer app, which everybody knows. But what not everybody knows is that on Venmo, there’s a feed, where you can like… tab over and you can see all of your friends’ and your contacts’ financial transactions, which should be illegal, but it’s there. (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) It’s right there. And I like it because it’s honest. It’s the only honest social media site out there. Every other social media site is a projection of a version of yourself that you wish you were onto a canvas. Not Venmo. Venmo is the honest antidote to the horseshit of Instagram. Instagram makes you feel bad because you’re aware of your own fears and insecurities and preoccupations, but you’re not seeing anybody else’s. So you’re always gonna lean that way. So you see a picture on Instagram of, like, a couple… (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING) Maybe they’re on, like, a beach… looking at a gorgeous sunset. Maybe they’re eating a pizza. (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING) You look at this, you’re like, “What the fuck? What the fuck? The fuck is wrong with me? How come I’m not doing that shit, huh? Is there something wrong with me? Is there a hole here that everybody can see? Do I emanate darkness, do I repel love? Is there a limit to my emotional aptitude? Did my father’s genetics set that limit? Do I need to go back on antidepressants? What the fuck is going on inside of me that’s not leading me to that type of bliss? What do I have to do to get there?” But then you look at Venmo and it’s like, “Oh, no, dude, they split that pizza.” (AUDIENCE CHEERING) (APPLAUSE) “I’m doing just fine.” (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) “I don’t need medication.” (CHUCKLES) It’s not a referendum on splitting stuff in a relationship. I think if you’re gonna split stuff, just don’t split the items. Go every other. Does that make sense? I’ll see that on Venmo. I go on Venmo, I’ll see, “Boyfriend sends girlfriend money for tacos.” I’m just, like, how the fuck do you go down on someone after you just sent them eight bucks? (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) (SCOFFS) “You’re just bitter, Drew, that you have no one to split stuff with.” (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) Yeah, I’m single. I’m 36… and single. I’m single and 36, which is fine. Uh, but it is almost not. (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING) Like, it’s not bad yet, but bad is next. (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) Bad is the next stop on this… train. A lot of my friends are married. And it’s cool to see. A lot of them are in, like, really great relationships, really healthy, good, loving relationships. And it’s really amazing to see. I go to their weddings, I really enjoy it. Seeing them come together, it’s a beautiful thing. And I hear a lot of the same things in the vows. There’s a common refrain in the vows, which is something about, like, you know, “I get to marry my best friend.” “I’m so lucky to have found my best friend.” “I never thought I would spend the rest of my life with my best friend.” And I hear that, I’m like, “That’s such a beautiful sentiment.” Like, the person you marry should feel… like your best friend. I’m in the back, I’m like, “Well, I’m 36, so who the fuck meets their best friend in their late thirties?” (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING) Who’s out there like, “This is my best friend! We met when were 38!” (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) “Tell him, Doug!” (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING) No, it doesn’t happ',\n",
              "  'en. They’re all having kids, too, starting families. My friends starting families, it’s beautiful to see. I don’t have my own family. I have, like, a family from which I’ve come. I don’t have… (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING) …the next line on that. Like on a family tree, I’m just a node that ends. (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING) It’s just like, “Who’s that?” “That’s your great Uncle Drew, nobody loved him.” (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) Just a leaf on a twig. Just a Styrofoam ball with no toothpicks, if we’re using school project lingo. (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING) “Oh, cool, you got me a PlayStation for my birthday. I love you, Dad.” I just beat God of War for the fourth time. (AUDIENCE MEMBER CHEERING) It’s a good game. (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING) It’s not “hugging my smiling child” good. (AUDIENCE LAUGH) But the gameplay mechanics are pretty tight. (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING) I think part of the reason I don’t… have a family, well, at least what I used to tell myself, is that I do this. It’s something that I chose. I chose a different path. I remember I started doing stand-up when I was 22. I dropped out of school, and… at the time, my mother warned me. She said, “You know, it’s not very stable. You’re gonna be living hand-to-mouth, traveling a lot. You’re not gonna be able to settle down.” And she was right to an extent. But the problem was, she was telling this to a 22-year-old dude. Like the least likely candidate on Earth to settle down. I don’t know if you know any 22-year-old dudes, but they’re not technically people. (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) Just unprocessed pain and skin. Like, that’s pretty much the identity there. So, 22, I’m hearing this, I’m like, “Settle down? What are you, a hundred? I don’t give a fuck. I’m going on the road, Mom. I’ma follow my dreams! Nobody is gonna stop me!” That was my attitude. Now I’m 36. Now I see the punchline. Now it’s like… (LAUGHS SARCASTICALLY) “Nobody is going to hug me as I die.” (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING) (CHUCKLES SARCASTICALLY) Is that funny? I don’t know. I structured it as a joke. Does that make it funny? I don’t know. Does comedy have the ability to transform the emotional constitution of reality, or is it just adding a layer to an unfortunate event? I don’t know how the physics of comedy work. I used to tell myself that it was a sacrifice I was making. I was leaving that on the side to pursue this. And I used to look… It was very easy to make that argument, ’cause I used to look around and there were a lot of men who accomplished things that I considered to be great, whose personal life was kind of left by the wayside. And so it seemed to me as a necessary component. I remember in high school I learned about Isaac Newton. And Isaac Newton invented calculus. He also died a virgin. (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING) Which begs the question, can you invent calculus while fucking people? (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) I don’t know. It’s never been done. (AUDIENCE LAUGHING, APPLAUDING) A more modern example, Steve Jobs. Steve Jobs was an incredible innovator… uh, terrible father… right, which we know, it’s documented, but we also just knew. (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING) We knew. Every time we’d go into our pocket, if Steve Jobs were a good dad, we’d pull out a Samsung or a Motorola. (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING) Every time you text someone and it shows up blue, that’s Steve Jobs not going to a piano recital -or a softball game. (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) And I don’t think we have the right to judge him. Like, we are all glad h',\n",
              "  'e did it. Like, we encouraged that. As a society, we would all rather one girl grow up with a shitty dad than have to all of us use Windows. Are you out of your fucking mind? You want us all to click a Start button and run clunky .exe files just so one girl can open her gifts next to the guy who paid for them? Fuck that! She can get them from a nanny while the rest of us enjoy our… technological ecosystem seamlessly integrated. (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING) That’s what we encourage. We encourage it. True happiness has no societal value. We want productivity. Give us… Make something or shut up! Like, we don’t care. So there’s this incentive to do it. And it gets even more fucked up. Someone like Michael Jackson, who was this incredible popstar and a horrendous babysitter, you know, where it’s just like… (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) Yeah, it’s an easy one, but it’s fun. It’s fun, though. It’s so easy, but it’s so fun. (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING) No, but even that, like there’s such an instinct to defend these guys. Like my first instinct is to be like… see it from their side, because I think we’re such… we’re conditioned to like them on that level. So even with Michael, I was like… you know, there was a part of me… I watched that documentary about him, I was like, “Oh, that’s fucked up.” But there was a part of me that was like, “Yeah, but if not an eight-year-old boy, who was Michael Jackson supposed to date?” (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING) You know what I mean? What is he looking at, options-wise, that makes any sense at all? Somebody his age? He did that. He was married to Lisa Marie Presley, a grown woman, and that was weirder somehow. (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) That was weirder. They made out on television. It was fucking weird. There was like an awards show presentation and at the end, they like did this kiss, it was just awful. Like, “Oh!” The whole world was just like, “Oh, my God.” (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING) “Jesus, will somebody get this guy a kid?” -Like, “This is horrible.” (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) Because Michael Jackson with a kid, it upsets us morally, but it looks right. (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING) Michael can’t date an adult. You wouldn’t set your friend up with him. (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING) Who’s he supposed to… What is he gonna do, go on like a blind date with a 35-year-old software developer? How’s that gonna go? “Hey, nice to meet you, Michael.” He’s like, “You wanna play tag? You’re it.” Like, come on. (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) “Where are your…” “Tag? I thought we’d go to dinner.” “Dinner’s for dumb-dumbs. We can eat candy at my house and stay up as late as we want. Tee-hee!” (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING) Michael can’t date an adult. I don’t even know what kind of adult would be into Michael. Like you wanna… you wanna fuck him? Listen to him sure, but, like, you wanna… (IMITATES MICHAEL JACKSON) You wanna fuck that guy? (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING) You wanna fuck him? “Here, doo-doo head.” You’re gonna fuck him? Dude, if you’re an adult and you wanna fuck Michael Jackson… you’re a pedophile. (AUDIENCE LAUGHING, APPLAUDING) But you look at all these guys, you know, Michael Jackson, Isaac Newton, Steve Jobs, they were adored by the world but hated by the people closest to them. And I would imagine that you’d tell yourself that that’s a sacrifice… that you make, but… as I get older, I look at it differently. I don’t know if I look at it as a sacrifice anymore. Maybe… maybe not. Maybe… they just ran from responsibility into the arms o',\n",
              "  'f ambition. You know, maybe Apple and Pixar… are just built off the back of one man’s inability to be intimate with the people closest to him. Or with himself. And so it recasts my own path, where I’m like, maybe this isn’t a sacrifice. I’m not comparing myself to… Steve Jobs and… Isaac Newton, you know. It’s a matter of scale. (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING) But even in the comedy world, even the people that I looked up to… When I started, all the people that I looked up to, they’re all either, like, prematurely dead, utterly miserable, or, like, sex criminals. So… where is this headed? (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING) Where is this path going? Their greatness is predicated on their accomplishments, but we fail to recognize how they failed in their private moments. And I think that’s a masculine definition of greatness. Because, like, I don’t look at that as great anymore because they couldn’t confront who they were as a person. They couldn’t confront the emotional reality of their experience. That is greatness to me. To do that, that is a much greater thing. How great can something be if it’s built on avoidance? I think you have to… confront. And it’s scary. It’s a scary fucking thing to do. Like, I get it. It’s like totally scary for a lot of reasons. One, you can find out that the story you’ve been telling yourself about yourself isn’t true. You can find out that what you thought was like the harsh, brutal reality of yourself, you’re just resting on an easier narrative that could be subverted by something else. Like I used to tell myself stories about myself that have shifted over time. I used to tell myself this was a sacrifice. I used to tell myself that what I was doing up here was important, that it was fearless. That I was fearless for doing this. I had the balls to say shit that nobody else did. Things like that Michael Jackson joke, I’d be like, “That’s fearless. That’s a fearless fucking thing. You can get mad at me. That’s fearless. I’m willing to stand that down.” But as I get older, I’m like, “That’s not… I think it’s funny, but it’s not fearless.” Because my emotional experience is nowhere in there. I’m nowhere in that joke. I wasn’t molested, and I’m not a pedophile. (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING) That would be fearless. (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) The most fearless pedophile joke you could tell is to be one and admit it publicly. (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING) No, worst-case scenario, worst-case scenario, the joke bombs and you don’t like it. You look at me, arms folded, shaking your head and say, “No.” Fortunately, that didn’t happen this evening, but it has happened. It could happen. You can get mad. You could think I suck. You could not like me. But, counterpoint… who are you? (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) I can barely see any of you, and I love none of you. So what is this power… that you hold over me? You’re not me. We are always our most terrifying audience. I believe that. That’s why it’s so funny when people say that, like, public speaking is the number one fear of people. They say, you hear that, “Public speaking is the number one fear of people.” It’s like, “Well, I’m sorry, was confronting yourself on an emotional level not on that questionnaire?” The fuck you talking about, public speaking? I’m public speaking right now. It’s fine. I’m public speaking as a way to avoid confronting myself on an emotional level. (AUDIENCE LAUGHING, APPLAUDING) This is all. Like, up here it’s, like, “Dopamine!” And',\n",
              "  ' if I were at home, it’d be like… (SCREECHES) (SCREECHES) I have used this to avoid so many… I can’t tell you how many relationships I’ve been in where I’ve been like, “Oh, sorry, I can’t hang out with you tonight. I have to go do a show.” Or more specifically, “Sorry, I can’t be there on your birthday. I need to go do this bit about how all my relationships fall apart.” (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING) It’s like just, “Do I need any of this?” And I think as men, we have this tendency to wanna process everything in our lives through, you know, intellect, or logic, or our thoughts, or our reason, things that we do, things that are tactile, and it’s like… you’re ignoring the entire emotional subset of your experience. And this idea that logic and emotions are separate, they’re not. Like your thoughts are not separate from how you feel. Your thoughts… Thoughts are just emotions in drag. (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING) It’s the same ecosystem. It’s hard to dive in… like that. Therapy’s a good way to do it. I think people… a lot of people need… They’re men… all men. (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING) Yeah, I’m comfortable saying that. All men need to go to therapy for… 20 years. Like… (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING, APPLAUDING) Roughly. (CHUCKLES) Sometimes guys get mad. They’re like, “Fuck you, I don’t need shit, you pandering pussy.” It’s like, “Hey. You do.” (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) “What was that?” (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING) Women need therapy too. But usually when a woman goes to therapy, it’s because a man in her life didn’t. (AUDIENCE LAUGHING, APPLAUDING) I started going four times a week. It’s a program, it’s called psychoanalysis, and it’s, uh… The reason you go so often is so that you don’t have time to close up. Like, if you go once a week, you have all week to just close back up, so you stay open throughout the week so you can access parts of yourself that are much harder to access normally. And so it’s very emotional. It’s very exhausting. It’s very trying. I cry a lot. I sob… The other day, I sobbed for, like, 20 minutes straight. And this is how fucked up I am. As soon as I collected myself, my first thought was, “That shouldn’t count toward my time.” (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING) But that’s me trying to get out of that moment. Like that moment was hard to swallow, and so… joke, out, now we’re out of it. But I don’t think that’s how progress gets made. I think if you wanna make progress, you can’t take that left turn at a punchline. You have to go… You have to sit there and process it there. You have to go down. You have to take that Miss Frizzle Magic School Bus all the way. “We’re going to your emotional core!” (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING) “Look out your left window. Is that Mom going on a date instead of hanging out with you? Yes, it is.” (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING) “Process it! Feel it!” You have to stay there, and leave it there. You can’t buy yourself out of the moment. Otherwise, the progress won’t get made. It’s very hard to do. And I’m up here and I, like, I want to bring you in. Like, that’s where this is going. Like I want… That’s the next step, is I want to bring you all to that place. But it’s hard because, like, I don’t know if there’s a show down there. But I wanna bring you in, but I feel conflicted. I feel like I can’t… I have to like… I feel like that’s how this works, is I go in, I mine my own life for sadness, and then I contort it into a balloon animal for you so you don’t feel ripped off. (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING) I tr',\n",
              "  'ied… to do that. I wrote… I wrote a joke… that tries to do that. Why did the chicken… (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING) …cross the road? AUDIENCE: Why? Because… he grew up… with an untreated hearing loss… which deprived him of a major sensory connection to the people around him, and it isolated him to the point of chronic torture. And his parents were too caught up in their own drama and insecurities to attend to it, so he processed it as though there was something inherently wrong with him. And his feelings are a threat to his relationships, so he just suffered in silence, feeling like he was 100 feet underwater, wondering why nobody was coming to save him. And then, he finally started wearing hearing aids, which created this insane sensation of being able to participate in a world that he didn’t understand. But because his self-worth was predicated on how special he felt, he realized that the trodden path didn’t appeal to him. So he would get high and watch stand-up comedy as a way to numb the agony of how lost he felt. And in doing so, he found a lot of connection with their points of view, and he thought, “Wow, if I could do that, people could connect to me like that.” So he decided to drop out of school and pursue stand-up comedy, and doing comedy made him feel better for a moment, but it never forced him to address any of the reasons he actually felt like shit. He so badly wanted to feel special and powerful to make up for how worthless he felt, so he would say all sorts of fucked-up things, onstage and off, as a way to separate himself. And a lot of it he stands by, but there are a lot of things he said that were flagrant and unnecessary and hurtful and racist and sexist and homophobic, all of which he justified under the guise of pushing the envelope, which he thought was an act of justified rebellion against some arbitrary authority. But too late, he learned that a lot of those boundaries are derived from real people’s feelings and experiences and he was essentially exploiting their actual pain and using it as a traffic cone to satisfy this story he was telling himself where he was a genius. And just because people laugh at something doesn’t inherently make it good. They could be just as emotionally immature or ignorant as the perspective in the joke, or they could be responding to joke structure and timing more than content. And then, one day… (MELANCHOLY MUSIC PLAYING) …all the world’s stages boarded up, so he sat alone in a room for a year, and he did nothing but talk to the walls and a therapist. And with no emotion to escape into, he slowly started breaking down the paradigm he’d constructed and moved into the feelings he was running from. And he discovered how badly he had been hurting his entire life, and what it actually is to hurt so badly. And he realized that there was not a single period of his life in which he was truly happy. And through that, he started to realize how much pain he had caused other people. He instantly regretted all the ways in which he’s needlessly made people feel like shit in order to protect his own conception of himself as strong. Then he wanted to disappear from the world entirely because he felt like such an incredibly bad person for having done these things. So his instinct was to beat himself up about it and tell himself what a horrible person he is, but he’s been shaming himself his entire life, and all these things he did were ',\n",
              "  'just ways to push people away and deprive himself of any meaningful connection, because of how badly he felt about himself, because it was too scary and painful to be open enough to connect to anyone else. So, while he hurt people, he was hurting no one more than himself, and he doesn’t want to do that anymore. He has worked so hard to clear out space within himself and feel safer in his own body and treat himself like a friend he loves as opposed to an enemy he hates, which means he no longer tolerates dynamics based on his own self-destruction, which has changed numerous relationships in his life, including the one with the art form that he loves. The fear has always been that if he makes peace with the subterranean feelings that drive all of this, he’d lose this piece of himself which has helped him survive and get to this point, a fear that he won’t be funny anymore, he won’t be special, he’ll just be, which has been an intolerable notion because he doesn’t feel like enough on his own. He’s only known how to exist by chasing, or thinking, or running, or fighting, or straining, or suffering, or striving, or analyzing, anxious energy which ultimately manifests the very same emptiness it’s borne out of. And it keeps him locked into one side of himself, but he’s making every effort to find a way to not give in to those anxieties and sit with the quiet inside of himself because he wants so badly to get to the other side.

              " ['Gary Gulman’s “Born on 3rd Base” transcends traditional observational comedy, offering an hour-long commentary on poverty and inequality with humor and unwavering candor. Set against the grandeur of Toronto’s Great Hall, Gulman transforms mundane experiences into poignant critiques of societal treatment of the poor, interweaving personal narratives with broader societal issues. His material, ranging from the trivialities of Pop-Tarts to the disparities in comedian earnings, is delivered with a confidence that challenges the audience to confront uncomfortable truths. Gulman’s approach is not only technically impressive but also deeply invested in pushing the boundaries of comedy to shed light on economic disparities, making the special a compelling blend of laughter and reflection. * * * Anyhow, a lot of comedians are starting that way, and I think it’s, I think it’s kinda jazzy. Alright. Gary, start the special. It’s… Alright, so I’m doing the special material, but also, I wanna give you a quick excerpt from my one-person show, which is… it’s a work in progress, but I, I have the title. It’s called “Mommy, Look.” And the title stems from my-my theory that… just about every one-person show could be called… “Mommy, Look.” I… I’ve said for a long time, you show me a 4-year-old on a diving board, screaming, “Mommy, look” to an unreceptive audience, in 14 years, I will show you a theater major. “Mommy, look! Mommy! Mommy!” “Mommy, look.” The subtext of my near 30-year comedy career is, “Mommy, look.” The same thing I’ve been screaming since I was 4 years old, just now, I’m doing it from the diaphragm. And with better posture, thanks to my theatrical training. Had my mother looked up once from her “People” magazine… …while I screamed, “Mommy!” I wouldn’t be here right now. I wouldn’t need this type of external validation. I– Some other maladjusted man-child would be here in my stead. I just wanna let the people in the front rows know that they are safe from me, asking what they do for work. I remember going to comedy shows when I was in high school, and later, and the comedian would ask somebody what they did for work, and then proceed to ridicule their profession. And I just remember thinking, if I am ever in the front row at a comedy show and a comedian asks me what I do for work, I will stand up and say, “What do you do for work?” I didn’t come here to be forcibly cast in your TikTok video. You lazy hack. But here’s the autobiography. I grew up in an oft-ignored sector of Jewish people called… poor. Which is kind of an O. Henry twist there. We were– We were poor Jews, but you laughed because it upset the status quo, but… A c',\n",
              "  'ulture as big, about 12 million of us, as big as Jewish people, we have versions of you… within it. There are poor Jews, there are rich Jews, there are smart Jews, there are dumb Jews. There are athletic Jews. Yes, there are poor Jews. And we were proper poor. Food stamps, free lunch. Welfare. We were on it. We were on welfare. I got free lunch. The dirty little secret about the free lunch program is that it’s also free breakfast. If you could get to school by 6:15 a.m. for a school day that started at 8:50… The indignities they thrust upon poor kids never end, even in the timing of that, that you would be forced to get up at 5:45 to get some calories, it was almost– It had to have been planned. Let’s prepare these kids for their futures as migrant apple pickers… …and longshoremen… …by getting them up at 5:45 for breakfast. And if you got there by 6:15, you could get a half pint of milk, a Pop-Tart, and a variety pack-sized Kellogg’s cereal box. I-I’m sorry, I said “and.” Or a variety pack-sized… …cereal. And if you got there any later than 6:20, all the good variety pack cereals would be taken. So you would wind up with the Corn Flakes… …which I do not know why they included that in the variety pack. No kid wants Corn Flakes. I would sometimes play it off if I got there late. I would say, “Oh, no, no. I didn’t– “I didn’t want Frosted Flakes. “I wanted, I wanted the Corn Flakes.” “I, I use it in my chicken recipe.” “My, my chicken recipe calls for “a variety pack-size of… …Corn Flakes.” Now, if I got there on time, I would always get the, get the Pop-Tart. But even in the Pop-Tart, the Pop-Tart… was just a complete F-you to the poor kids who were eating it. First of all, it was one Pop-Tart. I knew they came in packs of two. I’m poor. I am not stupid. And then, the other thing about the Pop-Tart, they had enough frosting to spread it all the way to the edge. I’m sure there was a person in the factory who said, “Hey, boss, we have, we have a lot of extra frosting today. “Do you wanna spread it all the way to the edge for this next batch?” And he said, “Do you want these kids to ever stop sucking at the government teat?” “That bitter crust will remind them of what their futures are going to look like.” “Frosting all the way to the edge? “Are you insane? Why don’t we put frosting on both sides while we’re at it?” “What are we, Toaster Strudel? Get back to work, Eugene V. Debs.” Everything about the Pop-Tart they did to screw with poor kids. First of all, the name. It’s not a real tart. And it brought about a cultural blind spot in all poor kids, where the first time we saw a real tart… …there was this cognitive dissonance, t',\n",
              "  'his disconnect. “Wait a minute. This…” The first time I ever saw it was at an Au Bon Pain. Au Bon Pain! It was a tart. It said tart, but it looked nothing like a Pop-Tart. The, the real tart has nothing in common with the Pop-Tart. Th-The real tart, first of all, it’s three-dimensional. The Pop-Tart is barely dimensional. You, you would have to be living in Flatland to consider that a dimension. Also, the real tart has chunks of fruit. Apples, pears, raspberries, blueberries in it. Whereas the Pop-Tart has a suggestion of a rumor of a whisper of fruit-flavored, artificially colored schmutz. It’s so fraudulent that the Pop-Tart calls itself… a-a tart. I’m gonna use an analogy… to clarify this. The– The tart is to the Pop-Tart, as the Grizzly bear is to the… gummy bear. Just… That’s a really strong analogy. And the irony of me coming up with such an apt analogy… is that… I flunked out of analogy school. And flunking out of analogy school is like… It’s as if… I used to think they called it a Pop-Tart because it popped out of the toaster. No. Pop is short for populist. It’s the poor man’s tart. Welfare saved my family, and I’m not ashamed to have been on it. It just has been demonized for decades, and unnecessarily so. It’s infuriating to me because they’ve been making the same argument. Even since I was a kid, they keep making this same argument, and it, and it goes usually like this. “Well, welfare doesn’t work. “That’s why we wanna, we wanna get rid of it. “We wanna strangle the welfare programs “because it just… Doggone it.” “Dagnabbit.” “It doesn’t work. Oh gosh, how I wish it worked!” “But what happens is the-the welfare recipients, “they lose their initiative, “and they become dependent on welfare for generation after generation.” And I remember even at 7 years old, I could see through that flimsy argument. Th-The one thing I will say about poor kids for us is that we’re much more astute about financial ideas and mechanisms than the average person. The-The rich kids have no idea how much we know about what things really cost. Like, at 7 years old, and I’m not exaggerating, I understood the tax ramifications of the alimony portion of my parent’s divorce decree, okay? Because every April, my mother would be crying on the phone with the IRS because it was taxable. The alimony part was taxable, and she owed. And they would, they would say, “We’re gonna put a lien on your house.” And I didn’t know how to spell that type of lien. No. I knew it wasn’t “lean” on our house. There were tears involved. So, I just, I understood these things at a level that most kids don’t understand because these were like traumatic moments in my ',\n",
              "  'life. So that when I heard this argument, “Welfare doesn’t work. “The people lose their initiative. They become dependent for generation after generation,” I couldn’t have put this into words because I didn’t possess the words “breathtakingly” and “disingenuous.” But… I knew they were full of shit. And-And I would’ve said, “Oh, you’re looking out for my, oh, my initiative. Thank you.” “Thank you for looking out for my character. “I, I have to admit, I was being a little bit cynical. I, I thought you just didn’t wanna pay any taxes.” “But you were looking out for my character. “Thank you so much. “Can I just share a little concern I have? “You already have more money than you can spend. You’re just gonna leave it in a trust fund to your children.” A trust fund is this very expensive way to tell your children you don’t believe in them. “You’re gonna leave this money to your children “in a trust fund. And I just… “I worry your children are gonna lose their initiative “and become dependent for generation after generation, which…” “…is the more likely scenario, considering it’s a cliché.” It’s a cliché we’ve been playing for laughs for hundreds of years, so… Do you know how long the average family stays on welfare? Two years. Two years. Two years is not a generation. Unless you’re a bandicoot. That’s not generation after generation. My family, we were off welfare, all of us, by the time we got out of high school. A pittance of an investment in the Gulman boys. We’ve repaid over and over again in our own taxes. I’m doing fine. This is all Banana Republic. Now, full disclosure, I purchased this “ensemble”… …during one of Banana Republic’s thrice-weekly 40% off sales. If you put in any effort at all, if you show any initiative… …you can wear Banana Republic – for the price of Old Navy. – I am not exaggerating. Just wait until the next 40% off sale. Now. They should have to put a sign up when they’re not offering 40% off, and that sign should say, “closed.” “We’ll email you when the next price break comes up.” Then go online, find yourself an additional 20% off promo code. I’ll give you what I used last week. “Summer savings.” Enjoy. Enjoy. Stock up on tees. Whenever I get the promo code, I always think to myself, “I coulda guessed that.” But, the truth is I couldn’t have. It’s always just clever enough. Okay, summer savings? Hm? They spelled summer with a dollar sign. Oh, Banana! You impish scamp! $30 for the shorts. How much for the whimsy? Free whimsy at Banana Republic. Half-off caprice. Capris? The short– No, no, no. Caprice. A synonym for whimsy. Okay, that’s just a little– I always– I pander to my base. Which… Which is libr',\n",
              "  'arians. Librarians right now, when they– I had them at O. Henry. And then… We never felt too poor, I will say, and there were, there were three reasons. The reasons were threefold. Imagine. Imagine if I used that suffix “-fold.” It is, without a doubt, the most pretentious suffix… …in the English language. Just say there were three. Threefold? The same type of people who say “threefold” also say, “For lack of a better term.” Whereas working class people like us, instead of saying, for lack of a better term, we go, “Uh…” For lack of a better term. Just think of a better term! The second– The second most pretentious suffix, I would say, is “-esque.” Unless you’re talking about something French, I think you– We’re “-ish” people. I feel comfortable around people who say “-ish.” I think one of the most pretentious things you can say is “Kafkaesque.” That’s just… you’re showing off. We’re working class. Just say “Kafkish.” Which has the benefit of also sounding like a kosher pastry. Can I get a pound of the Kafkish? And a dozen rugelachhh. And a raisin chhhallah. I don’t know if, if Jews are doing this everywhere, but in an attempt to assimilate, I’ve noticed a lot of Jewish people pulling back on the “chhh.” They’re saying challah and rugelah. And I say no. Embrace the “chhh.” Embrace it! What are they gonna do? Hate us? Alright, so the reasons are threefold. There are three reasons… …why we didn’t feel poor. One. For a poor family, we had pretty good electronics. We frequently had a good television set. Sometimes, we even had a good stereo. And this was all thanks to my Uncle Norman’s job. My mother’s twin brother, Uncle Norman. His job, he was… a burglar. What did I tell you about Jewish people? We have a version of every profession. Uncle Norman was a burglar. And you’re like, “Yeah, but he got out of it and moved on.” No, no, no, he died a burglar. He was, actually, a fence. He would receive stolen merchandise and then resell it. The man never made an honest dollar in his life, but… he got us incredible electronics. Poor people, you have to understand, we’re not very picky about warranties and… …serial numbers and receipts. We just wanna watch color TV. So, Uncle Norman would get us these things, and sometimes, he would store things in our house until the heat was off. Wh-Which took on this other meaning for the heat was off, ’cause sometimes, the heat was off in our house. But we’d have a pinball machine in our kitchen. We were warming our hands on The Who’s “Tommy.” So, that was the first reason we didn’t feel poor. The second reason we didn’t feel poor was that the income inequality was not as vast, as significant, in t',\n",
              "  \"he ’70s. And up until 1983-ish… …it wasn’t as bad as it, as it is now. What we’re living in now, I would categorize it as “Tale of Two Cities-esque.” In fact, it’s-it’s worse than 18th-century France, In 18th-century France, according to “Tale of Two Cities,” and I’ll just do a little bit of the preamble. The overlapping is-is astonishing. “It was the best of times. It was the worst of times.” Check. “It was the age of wisdom. It was the age of foolishness.” Big check. “It was the epoch of belief. It was the epoch of incredulity.” But I could keep going. But, at no point did Dickens say, “Also, three or four times a week, there was a show called ‘Shark Tank.'” Even the 18th-century French aristocrats never made their “entrepreneurs” dance for a small investment in their life’s work. That is a cruelty… …that is just us. I– That show… I hate it! Please, if you have an idea, do not go on “Shark Tank.” There are… places that offer much better terms… …than the “Shark Tank” sharks. I happen to have an accounting and finance degree from Boston College. “It’s no Harvard”… was our motto. It sounds much nicer in Latin. Okay, so here’s a place where you can get better terms than the “Shark Tank” sharks, and this is where you should take it. A bank! They make reasonable investments in small businesses. You know who else offers better terms than the “Shark Tank” sharks? The Devil! He’ll take your soul. He will not take as much of your annual net income as the “Shark Tank” sharks. Also, Mr. Gazzo from “Rocky 1,” the loan shark, he offers better terms than the “Shark Tank” sharks. Do not go on “Shark Tank.” I wanna start a show to counter-program against “Shark Tank,” and I would call it… “Guillotine.” And what would happen on “Guillotine” is billionaires would sit in front of working class folks like ourselves, and they would have to convince us not to chop their heads off on live television. And we– “How much of it are you gonna give away? “Some of it? No, no. That’s not enough. – That’s not enough. – Bring the blade up.” “You’re gonna give all of it away? Okay. Alright. No blade.” The income inequality is just… it’s cartoonish. Even in my business, just the difference between me and– Do you remember the guy who played Jerry on “Seinfeld”? Okay. He’s in the same business, ostensibly, as I am, but he is worth over $1 billion. And now let’s say he’s a, he’s a better comedian, for argument’s sake, but then we’ll come back to this universe. Can you imagine? Is he $999,911,000 better than me? And now, you know my net worth. About $89,000, if you consider my security deposit to be an asset. The accounting is murky on that. I’m probably not \",\n",
              "  'gonna get the entire… …security, ’cause I had, had dogs, and so… Here’s the thing. Jerry Seinfeld, okay? He owns a building in Manhattan where he houses his extensive Porsche collection. Okay? My wife and I, we don’t have enough room on our kitchen counter to keep the toaster on display at all times. And here’s what’s beautiful about this audience. You’re so generous. You are all picturing a four-slicer. It’s a deuce. My wife and I had to have an apartment-wide meeting… …in which we determined that we-we needed to keep the microwave oven on the counter because you can’t take it out every time you want popcorn. And we had to keep the coffee machine on the counter at all times because I want no delay in getting to the machine that makes the beverage that makes life tolerable. So, she said we should put the blender and the toaster in a cabinet. I’m sorry. The cabinet. And so why am I bitter? Because I can’t imagine that the Seinfelds have to rank their appliances. That’s why I’m jealous. The third reason. The third-fold… …why we never felt poor was my dad. Phil Gulman was what we call a mensch. He was a kind, thoughtful, generous man. A complete failure in terms of capitalism. He never made a great living, but he left us with such strong values. No valuables. I got– I’m not exaggerating. I got his copy of “Gone Girl.” But the values. I remember– This is why we didn’t feel poor. Because he had this policy. He would say, “If there’s something you really want, “just ask me. Don’t steal. Don’t go to Uncle Norman.” “Come to me. I’ll try to find the money.” And then sometimes, he would come through with the money. I remember for my 11th birthday, he got me all the books for “Dungeons and Dragons” and the expert playing set, which came with, like, nine different types of dice. But, unfortunately, and nobody could have foreseen this, it didn’t come with any friends. So he got me that. But then one year, I think it was, like, 1978, let’s say. I wanted to play– I wanted to keep playing hockey. But hockey, the price for a season of playing hockey was $50 in ’77. And then in 1978, they raised it to $500 because of a new tax policy in Massachusetts, where I grew up. It was called “Prop two-and-a-half.” And people would save 2.5% on their property taxes, and all they had to give up was children’s art, music, gym, afterschool sports, and tutoring. It sounded like a tax policy designed by a Roald Dahl villain. But I wanted to keep playing hockey, so I said to my dad, “I really wanna play hockey.” He said, “If you really wanna play hockey, “I’ll try to find the money “for you to play this sport you’ve shown no potential in.” “Not only have y',\n",
              "  'ou shown no potential in hockey, but Jews…” “…have acquitted themselves with very little distinction, “to be honest with you, Gary. “Son, go grab the Sports Almanac. “We’re gonna look at the Hockey Hall of Fame. We will count the Jewish players in the Hockey Hall of Fame.” And we open up the book. He said, “Okay, ready? Done.” This was 1978. There were zero Jewish players in the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1978. Now, there are zero Jewish players in the Hockey Hall of Fame. My dad said, “Just for a point of comparison, son, “more Jews have been… the Messiah.” “Do you– “Do you understand that, Gary? That you… “are more likely to walk on water “than you are to skate on it, holding the Stanley Cup?” “But if you really wanna play, we’ll find the money. Yeah, we’ll find the money, Jesus.” One benefit, and I’m sure there are a number of benefits, to growing up poor, for one, it-it humbles you, but also, it makes you more compassionate, more empathetic. I think empathy is, is one of the most valuable things we can teach our kids and-and grow up with. It’s just– It’s almost automatic for poor people because we’ve struggled, and we feel bad seeing other people struggle or-or suffer. Now, that’s not 100% of poor people. Some people get money, and all of a sudden, they wanna pull up the ladder behind them and lock the door. But, for most of us, we really go out of our way to try and help people and also be more thoughtful and-and kind to people. You’ll notice that people who have worked fast food jobs are much more polite to the fast food people. People who have waited tables and bartended are the best tippers you will ever be around because we know how much those tips mean to people. And, and we go into fast food restaurants, and we’re much more patient with the people. I think one of the best examples of the rudeness that people treat fast food workers and workers of-of that category is at any of these restaurants where you direct the assembly of your meal. Your Chipotles, your Subways, your Just Salads, your Chop-t. Like, going to Chipotle, you may not have noticed this before tonight, but I assure you you will never not notice it after tonight. The people in front of you at Chipotle, as they direct the assembly of their burrito– Uh, sorry. Or their bowl. I try to be inclusive because– Because people, they feel hurt, and then you get the message the next day. “I was at Gary Gulman’s early show “in Toronto, where he ignored those of us who opt for the bowl.” “Who eschew…” “…the tortilla… “in favor of the bowl for dietary, religious, or political reasons.” Alright. As you’re directing the assembly of the burrito, or the bowl, the people',\n",
              "  ' in front of you, notice this. They’ll… Corn. Corn. Corn. Corn. Black beans. Brown rice. You’re like, “What, they point?” Nah, pointing is, is bad, but forgivable. They wag their fingers… …at other humans. That is staggeringly condescending. Also completely unnecessary. They know where the corn is. You found it. You don’t even work here. How would they not know where the corn is by this point in their shift? Just people who’ve worked in this job, we would never, because we’ve had fingers wagged at us. We would always give the Chipotle worker the benefit of the doubt. We would say “corn.” And then, if they looked baffled… …we would subtly… …before we ever got to that point! I wouldn’t last a shift at Chipotle. I’m so sensitive. Like, earlier tonight, I didn’t say anything ’cause we’re taping a special, but earlier tonight, when I said “Jewish poor,” I felt like most of you laughed in the right way. But, some of you, I felt, um… I mean, I might be being overly sensitive, but did you feel a little bit of a Holocaust denial? Like-Like, there was a laugh, it was like, “ha ha ha ha.” And you, you just heard, “ha ha ha ha.” I heard, “The numbers were exaggerated!” But I’m overly sensitive. So, what I’m saying is… I would not last six seconds at Chipotle. Somebody would come in. “Corn.” And I would… Brenda, I found the corn! It was with the other toppings! Isn’t, isn’t it always the last place you look? She’s– – I sent her into the walk-in. – She must be freezing, and it was here all along. Thank you so much. Where is the brown rice? But make sure to jam your finger into the sneeze guard so I have something to Windex at the end of my shift. Just something to look forward to… …before I go home. How can you be that mean to people? Just that… dismissive of people who probably aren’t being paid a living wage. Might have health insurance. Definitely don’t have dental. I-I love my dentist, but I have… I have a history with dentists in that, I don’t know if you know this about poor people, but most people go to a dentist for their teeth. But poor people, my mother specifically, would go to a local university that had a dental school, and these hungover 23-year-olds would take their midterms in my mother’s mouth, basically, just– And fail again and again and again. Just these mediocre students, just mucking around in my mother’s incisors and bicuspids. And it just built in me kind of this-this antipathy towards dentistry because– I love my dentist, but dentistry, it’s organized crime. First of all, the hygienist does 99.985% of the work. It shouldn’t be called, “going to the dentist.” It should be called, “going to the hygienist featurin',\n",
              "  'g the dentist.” Like, the dentist shows up, has this Stan Lee-ish cameo. One line, which is always, “Oh, we don’t take any insurance.” Did you think you had insurance? You don’t have insurance. You have a free cleaning, which is like the loss leader of dentistry. It’s like the cheap grapes at the front of the grocery store. You’re– “We brought you in here “to find $8,000 worth of work we can do in your mouth. So, no, you don’t have, you don’t have insurance.” You know how you know you don’t have dental insurance? You need dental insurance. That’s how you know you don’t have it. Every other doctor takes insurance. Dr. Dre takes my insurance. Doctors Who, Seuss, Dolittle, Strange, and Doom all take my insurance. They take my insurance in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. “Doctor, doctor, give me the news.” “I’ve got a bad case of loving you.” He… …takes my insurance. It’s unfathomable. A heart surgeon will open up your chest, replace a valve, put in four stents, save and extend your life, $45 co-pay. A… dentist mostly fills miniature potholes. Cash only today. We’ll work out a payment plan like any other strip mall retailer, but you’re gonna pay. And what’s so surprising is that dentists have all come together to deny my insurance. And yet, they are a profession notorious for not being able to reach a consensus on even the simplest of propositions. In a study… …a very serious, important, groundbreaking study, only four out of five dentists… …felt comfortable recommending Trident… …to their patients who chew gum! Now, you-you have to be around my age or older to understand why I stress “chew” gum. There was this commercial in which the narrator would say, “Four out of five dentists recommend Trident to their patients who ‘chew’ gum.” And I remember as a kid, I would say to my mother, “Why are they saying it like that?” “Why are they saying ‘chew’ gum? It should be chew gum.” And my mother by this point had developed Stockholm syndrome. And so, she would side with the dentists. And a lot of poor people, we have this pathology where we convey wisdom on rich people that they just don’t have. So, I would say to my mother, I said, “Why would they say their patients who ‘chew’ gum?” And my mother, always defending the rich, “I think they know what they’re doing, Gar.” Not in this case! By saying they’re patients who “chew” gum, they’re making it sound like there are alternatives… …to how we ingest gum. Oh, you recommend Trident to your patients who “chew” gum? What do you recommend to your patients who… snort gum? What do you recommend to your IV gum users? What do you recommend they…? Fruit Stripe gum? Okay, yeah. ‘Cause it starts o',\n",
              "  'ff very strong, and then it, it doesn’t linger. What do you recommend to your patients who absorb gum through a semi-permeable membrane using a process known as osmosis? In other words, what do you tell your amoeba patients? Sorry, or your paramecium. I just don’t wanna get that… “I’m a paramecia. “A zillion of us came to Gary Gulman’s early show, “and we were so disappointed “that he acknowledged the amoebas, “but ignored almost half of the unicellular organism community.” “This was a slight I felt deep in my ribosome…” “…and mitochondria. My husband was literally pulling his cilia out.” Many of you sat in science class in eighth grade and thought, “When are we gonna need this?” June 22nd… 2020… I’m gonna dub in whatever year it is. Every year, I’m gonna… “Four,” so it’ll be, “This guy, he’s unbelievable.” ’24. But I have, I have a strong empathy. It might be– Sometimes, it gets in the way of enjoying things, and I, I think, “Well, I can’t enjoy certain things.” Like, I don’t– I’ve been upgraded to first class sometimes because I have all these miles from traveling, and I just don’t enjoy a moment of it because I feel like kind of a traitor to my class. And I’m-I’m incredibly insecure, and I’ve spent so much time walking through first class and just judging and, and making up stories in my head. And I don’t mean to distance myself from you, but I fly Comfort Plus. It’s just, it’s a, it’s a trade-off. For an extra $135, usually, I can get the legroom that prevents me from having my legs amputated because of blood clots. I cannot sit in-in the coach class. It just doesn’t work for me. So, I’m going to my Comfort Plus seat. I get so anxious and embittered. I always say, “Honey, don’t be impressed with these people. “If they had their shit together, they’d be in a private jet right now.” “They all have bosses. They all have bosses. “Don’t be dazzled by their Tommy Bahama polo shirts. These are not people to be impressed with.” The sad part is I’m almost always traveling alone when I do that. I can’t because of the empathy. I’m always boycotting things because I feel bad for enjoying things because of what they represent. I-I won’t drive a Mercedes-Benz. Even if I could afford one, I would not drive a Mercedes-Benz. Just so we’re all on the same page, Mercedes-Benz was not neutral during the Holocaust. They chose a side, and I, and I’m not going to– If you’re a Jew and you drive a Mercedes-Benz, please just tell me you won it in a raffle. I cannot… abide… Jews driving Mercedes-Benzes. I’m always boycotting things. I used to watch the NFL every Sunday from between four and 14 hours and… And then, they banned Colin Kaepernick f',\n",
              "  'rom making a very reasonable protest by taking a knee. And I said, well, I’m done with that group. And the thing that’s aggravating is my boycotts never work. They’re having another Super Bowl. It’s already been given a date. I became vegan after seeing this documentary called “Food, Inc.” I saw how they were treating the chickens, and I said, “Well, that’s the end of that.” And I– Oh, man, I loved, I loved those foods. But then, I said, “I can’t. I can’t be a part of that.” Then, I saw a picture of a sea turtle in “National Geographic,” and it had a plastic straw stuck in its, in its cute little nostril, and they had to use a pliers to take it out. And I thought, “Oh, that could have been my plastic straw from a…” Right? It could’ve been any of our… …plastic straws. And I made a vow that day. I say, “From here on out, it will not be one of my plastic straws.” And people, when I told them I’m off plastic straws, they go, “What do you do about smoothies?” And I said, “Well, I-I put a moratorium on smoothies until I– until I could figure it out.” And what I figured out was that this, this stainless steel straw is the answer. It’s a a really good suck. By the way, I have no dog in the sea turtle fight. None of my ancestors are sea turtles. But the empathy, oy. So, I use this, and I-I love it. For $14.99, I got four of these, and it comes with a free pipe cleaner which answers your question, “How do you keep it clean?” Free pipe cleaner. So, look at me. I’m not only saving the majestic sea turtle, but also the near defunct… …the moribund pipe cleaner industry. The– The pipe cleaner industry was on its last legs. And here’s what’s so precious about the pipe cleaner industry’s last legs. It’s made out of a pipe cleaner. It’s made out of a pipe cleaner. And what they did was they took the points, and they, they folded it up so it looks like feet. Empathy. The thing with empathy is that… certain things, they hit you so hard, you feel it, and it can limit you. Like, because of my empathy, I can’t watch… close-up magic anymore. Which sounds like a non-sequitur, but it’s a sequitur. Okay, I have been a fan of magic as long as I’ve been… coherent, and I used to be a-a magician when I was a kid. Like a lotta kids, I had tricks, and I had a magic set, and I would make tricks from books and things like that, and I would practice all the time. And then one Passover, on, I think, night two at a seder, I asked my dad if I could put on a little magic show after the– Of course, I would do my job. I would ask the four questions, but then after the seder, after Dayenu say… “Gulman got really Jewy.” “I thought his base was librarians.” “It’s mi',\n",
              "  'ddle-aged Jews.” I asked my father if I could do a magic show, and he said, “I, I don’t know, son. It might be a sacrilege to do magic on Passover.” And my argument was, I said, “Dad, “what was Moses’ splitting of the Red Sea but the greatest ta-da…” “…in Jewish history?” And he, and he laughed, and he said, “Keep it tight.” Okay, so I was doing the magic tricks, and my brothers were sitting there and just calling out every single trick. “What’s in your other hand? Roll up your sleeve. What did you just drop?” And I was 7. You’re picturing them being 10 or 11, which is obnoxious, but forgivable. They were 20 and 23. The gift you have given me tonight, that I can be myself. Like, you enjoy my jokes, but you also enjoy me, which is just– I don’t know if you know what goes on… I don’t know if you know what goes on before the show, but I, I say a little prayer of gratitude. And then, then I remind myself of something my therapist always tells me, which is, um, “The audience, Gary, they’re not your family.” “These people are rooting for you.” So, this was why I stopped doing magic, I couldn’t, I couldn’t handle the heckling. I still loved magic all my years. And I-I remember the last time I went to a magic show. I was so moved. I went to this show at the Magic Castle in Hollywood. And the young man did this trick. And it sounds basic, but it was very complicated, and I knew how much effort must have gone into perfecting it. So, he does this thing. He says, “Pick a card, any card.” I pick the queen of diamonds. And then he handed me the queen of diamonds and a Sharpie and asked me to sign the back of the card. And so, I did that. Then he took the card with my signature and the Sharpie, put it into the deck, and did a series of elaborate shuffles, culminating in the cascading bridge. The… My sound effects are so poor. Cascading bridge, which I can’t do and makes me less of a man. Sometimes, people will ask me, they’ll say, “Gary, do you wanna play poker with us?” And I’ll say, “Oh, I don’t, I don’t gamble.” But the truth is I don’t shuffle. But, this guy, his cascading bridge, it was just perfection. So, he takes the deck, and then he put it into the pocket. This pocket in his blazer. From this pocket, he removed an orange. And I screamed, “How?!” “I just saw you put the deck into this pocket. I watched every moment of it from here to here. Now, you’re implying it’s in the middle of that orange?” When I told my mom this story, she said, “Gar, honey, how’d you know the card was in the orange?” And I said, “Oh, that’s because I– I’ve seen magic before, you dingbat.” He didn’t pull out the orange ’cause he was concerned I had scurv',\n",
              "  'y. “Bullocks to Gulman, who so blithely mentioned scurvy.” “A vitamin C deficiency that ravaged the British Royal Navy “in the 17th and 18th centuries. “First, he went after ‘Seinfeld,’ and I said nothin’.” “‘Cause I weren’t ‘Seinfeld.’ “Then, he went after dentists, and I said nothin’ ’cause I don’t care for them blokes neither. Then, he came for me.” “Also, I thought it was a low blow and petty and spiteful that he mocked those of us who still sent our emails using a manual typewriter.” “And while I don’t wanna stoop to his level and pick nits, but ‘is mime work is rubbish!” “He would have his audience of librarians and middle-aged Jewish women believe that we return the carriage after every bloody letta!” “And that we only type words that could be typed entirely with the left ‘and, such as west and steward and abracadabra.” So, he hands me the orange. And he says, “Inspect it, make sure it hasn’t been doctored or manipulated in any way.” I said, “What can I prove?” “Without… “Without an MRI, “I got nothing. All I can say is bravo. “This is the greatest trick I’ve seen from this distance in my life. You are incredible.” And so, I handed him back the orange. He peeled it. Sure enough, in the center, queen of diamonds. My signature. Some pulp. “He’s self-referential!” And then he said, and this, to me, was the most impressive part of the trick. He said, “Is this your card?” That blew me away, right? The humility. I don’t possess that. It’s, it’s insecurity. I gloat. I boast. It’s– I know it sounds counterintuitive, but when you don’t believe in yourself, you’re so shocked when you come through, you’re like, “Yeah, in your face!” Like, I’ve been obnoxious about that. Like, when I was in high school, if I– uh, playing basketball, if I made a shot over you, and I, I would have… …and your coach called timeout to staunch the bleeding… …I wouldn’t go over to my huddle. I would go over to your huddle, stick my beak in, and say, “I’d bring in someone who can guard me.” And sometimes, the referee would come over and say, “Son, you pull that again, I’m gonna tee you up.” And I would say, “Pull what? Offer sage defensive counsel?” Sometimes, I’d go to the free throw line, I’d make the first one, and then, I’d turn to whoever fouled me and say, “Regrets?” “We could all be playing basketball right now if you’d shown a little self-control.” “I’m gonna make this next one, “even though your fans and cheerleaders are screaming, “Miss!” Lemme tell you something, kids. While you were all at prom and semi-formal and the Enchantment Under the Sea dance, I was keeping my elbow in… …and following through. I’m not gonna miss. You know what I con',\n",

              " ['Man… We were waiting for you. I’m happy you’re here. I’m happy all of you are here. I have so much to tell you. You’re comfortable? You can talk back to me. I want you guys to feel that. This only works if we feel like family. I know the camera’s here and it’s a whole thing. It’s a big night, it’s a lot of pressure. That kinda thing, you know? I want you guys to feel as comfortable as I hope to be. We got a lot of shit to talk about. I’m happy you’re here. I need you. I wanna talk about secrets! Secrets! I should whisper it, right? I carried a lot of secrets my whole life. I feel like I was birthed into them. One of my biggest, one of my last held secrets is my name. My name is not Jerrod. Welcome to the show, everybody. I thought we were being honest tonight. Jerrod’s my middle name. I was given the name Jerrod by my brother, Joe. He’s, like, seven years older than me. They just trusted a kid to name a kid, but whatever. I’m thankful for that. Without him I’d have to go by my real name, my first name, which we don’t talk about. It is not good. I don’t like it. I’ve always hated that name, no one calls me that except for my mom. My dad named me… He combined his dad’s first name and my mom’s dad’s first name and mushed them together. Not to make something elegant, like William Edward or something like that. It’s more like Toyotathon. I hate that name. I’ve hidden that name my whole life. I used to get it removed from the yearbook. Every year in high school I would bribe somebody. It’d cost me 20 dollars to get my first name taken out of it. I never let people see my driver’s license. I had it taken off my bank cards. I’ve always been ashamed of it. I’ve always hidden it. And it’s funny because it’s a name given to me to honor two people. It’s supposed to be this gift to both my granddads',\n",
              "  '. And it almost seemed kind of fucked up that I hide that, that I like tuck it away, but that’s because you don’t know my grandfathers. If you knew them, you’d know keeping a secret is the only way to honor them. That’s kind of who they were. They were granddads. I’m named after two men who most of their lives, most of their sex lives at least were secrets. My mom’s dad had four kids with my mom’s mom, his wife, and four kids outside of that marriage, just kind of scattered about. My dad’s dad had five kids with his wife and about 23 outside of the marriage. Yeah. I come from a long line of cool n*ggers. 23. Dillon, South Carolina. Jim Gowens is his name. We don’t have the same last name because my dad was an outside kid. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. There’s no easy way to say your grandma was a side piece. I wanna say it was something else. They’d prefer I used terms like “affair” and whatever, but nah, that’s not what it was. She was fuckin’ a married n*gger and that’s just… So my grandma had three kids by a married man, my uncle Pete, my dad, my aunt Nell, and his wife found out and confronted my grandma about it. I like to think it was on some “Color Purple” shit, like she crossed the field or whatever. But she confronted my grandma and demanded that she stop sleeping with her man, and my grandma fucked him again and had my Aunt Cat. I think she’s where I get my ambition from. My aunt Cat is proud of that, by the way. She’ll tell everybody her origin story. She’s like: “Don’t nobody tell me who to sleep with.” “And then she fucked him again and had me out of spite.” “That’s me, I’m the spite baby.” She loves that shit. But we don’t really talk about it. We don’t really talk about it. My dad doesn’t really know his dad, but he still felt enough pride to name me after him. My mom’s dad was',\n",
              "  ' also like a cheater, but she lived in the house that he was cheating from. And so when you’re that family, you learn not to say shit. My mom, I guess, learned from her mom. I’m trying to paint a picture of a world before Destiny’s Child, where women got cheated on and it didn’t play out like a Terry McMillan novel. It was much more quiet than that. They just kind of existed with the secret. They knew, but they didn’t know. It’s weird, it’s like generations of that, generations of just seeing things, not seeing things. I saw my parents’ sex tape. This is kind of a side tangent. I was about twelve years old. I came home from school early. I would watch my dad… If you got a dad or an older brother, they might’ve had a porn stash. This was the ’90s. My dad kept his tapes in a Nike box in the bedroom closet on the top shelf, beside a gun and a jar of nickels. And I remember putting this tape in, and it was about 15 seconds before I started recognizing the bedroom. I know those sheets, they got lemons on them. But that’s the thing, I never told my family. I never told my parents that I’d seen that. It’s odd because it’s one of those things… You can’t talk about sex with your parents, not that anybody really wants to, but you just can’t. And you’re only here because your parents fucked, isn’t that kinda funny? Your dad came in your mom and you’re here. Have you ever been watching a movie with your parents and a sex scene came on and you just gotta be, like, “nope, no it’s not”. Things that exist, but don’t exist. It’s things that are right there, hiding in plain sight. My father had me and my brother with my mom, and then he had four kids with a bitch named Raneta. It’s not that I hate her name. It’s just that it sounds like a villain in a Tyler Perry movie. And other kids, he had other kids.',\n",
              "  ' My dad was, he was really out there, man. He was really, really out there. And I knew about it since I was a kid. It was a small town, and it’s a secret that he thought he was keeping from the family. He thought he was doing a good job keeping the secret. But I found out. I never told him that I knew. My brother found out. He didn’t tell him. It’s funny to live in a house with someone knowing who they are, knowing that they’re cheating on your mom and not saying anything to him. He used to go out on Friday nights, he would say he was going to work. My dad is a truck driver, which by the way, if you’re cheating on your wife and you’re looking for a profession that allows just long blackout dates, get your CDLs and hit the road. I really recommend it. He would say he was going to a second job on Friday nights, but he would get dressed up, and I mean dressed up by North Carolina dad standards. He tucked his t-shirt into his jeans. He would say he was going to work with cologne on. Do you understand what I’m saying? It’s just, like, a liar. And it would just leave me as a kid knowing that… It’s weird to know it, to know, to really, really know, and not say anything. I was scared. I didn’t know what to say. I don’t know what I could’ve done. I don’t know if I would’ve said anything if I had the courage, because I only saw this secret as something that could’ve torn our family apart. If my mom found out, I thought it would be over. He was fucking my homeboy TJ’s aunt. This was this story TJ told me about, and that’s hard because TJ, he didn’t want to snitch. In the hood… I didn’t wanna snitch! He told me, he was like: “Man, I came home from school the other day” “and I went to my aunt’s house” “and your pop was just there on the couch.” What? He’s like: “Yeah, yeah, yeah, he was just on the ',\n",
              "  'couch.” He saw my dad sitting on the couch. He walks in, he’s excited to see my dad. He knows my dad very well, they used to play Madden together. He knows him. He’s like: “Mr. Carmichael, what are you doing here?” And my dad, being caught, under pressure, you know what he did? He just squinted his eyes and pretended he was somebody else. I don’t know how that was supposed to work. He literally was just like: “Mr. Carmichael? I don’t know who you’re talking about.” He just grabbed his shit and got the fuck outta there. My father. And TJ was there with his aunt and he said: “Do you know who that was?” “That’s my best friend’s dad. That’s Joe Carmichael.” And she said: “Joe Carmichael?” “He told me his name was Jerry Rice.” That’s right, that’s right. My father was telling bitches his name was Hall of Fame wide receiver Jerry Rice. Do you know how absurd that is? And I got so many questions, things he won’t talk about. Did you say it? Did you act surprised? “Did you go: What? There’s another Jerry Rice?” Was it all part of the game? Did he go: “Yeah, my name is Jerry Rice. I know. I get it all the time.” How did he react? He was a wild man, he was really out there, really, really out there, just holding it in, just holding it all in. He had a double or triple bypass surgery, I guess that’s where it went. It’s fine. I’m paying for his health insurance. Don’t groan for the man. I’m keeping him alive right now. I made him tell my mom. It became too much. It’s a secret that I think I was happy keeping as a child because I thought it made sense for the family, but then it was embarrassing, first of all. Because people knew. It seems like everyone knew, but my mom, and that’s really tough because my mom is a very sweet, loving, trusting, Christian, God-fearing woman, who was just standing by he',\n",
              "  'r man, trusting her husband. And my dad was just, you know, he was really out there. I got really drunk in London and I was like: “It’s time.” “I’m gonna confront him about it.” And it’s hard. This was hard because this is a tough man. Again, he kept a sawed-off shotgun in the closet by the porn, and it’s not easy. It’s not easy. I was really afraid, but I remember starting the call saying: “Listen, this will all go well as long as you don’t lie to me.” And I was just almost in tears and just so emotional. “I know about everything, man. I know about Renita,” “and the kids, and the blah blah blah,.” You know what he said? He actually said: “I always knew you’d be the one.” That’s what he said. He knew. So I made him tell my mom. He waited until I was back home in North Carolina to tell her, fucking pussy. I know, that’s a pussy thing to do, right? He waited. He needed the support. He waited until I was home. And this was his big plan to tell my mom. He was like: “Okay, so you and your brother, you take her out to dinner.” “I’m gonna stay home. And then you bring her back from dinner.” “You drop her off, she’ll come in the house, and then I’m gonna tell her.” And I was like: “Okay, you want me to hide a gun behind the toilet, too?” “What kinda Godfather plan is this?” But I went along with it. It took a lot for him. That dinner was the worst dinner I’ve ever had in my entire life. I took my mom to a hibachi restaurant. Earlier that day, I had taken my nieces to see the “Trolls” movie. I love going to the movies with my nieces. It’s the best. They’re not my kids so I can just get high and do fun shit with them, it’s the best. And we’d seen the “Trolls” movie, and I don’t know if you’ve seen it, spoiler alert. The premise is that these are these colorful trolls that are singing and all type',\n",
              "  's of shit, and if something devastating happens to them, they lose all of their color. I remember thinking that the whole dinner, that whole night is just looking at my mom, just looking in her eyes going: “She’s going to lose her color.” It was really, really scary. Mind you, all of this happened at a hibachi grill, so I’m looking in her eyes, but there’s a flame and we gotta clap every couple minutes. He’s juggling salt and pepper shakers. “Yay, okay. My mom is about to be fucking destroyed,” “but this is a great trick.” I get mad when I don’t get a Japanese chef. Sometimes they’re Mexican and they’re just passing them off as… Anyway. How many Japanese chefs are there in North Carolina? I’m piecing this together now. I brought her home. I dropped her off. I went to my brother’s house, and we waited by the phone very, very anxiously, me, my brother, and sister-in-law just waited, very nervous. And then my mom called. I could hear in her voice that she’d been crying. And I’ll never forget, her first words were: “I’m okay.” And he told her, begged for her forgiveness. She forgave him, she stayed. It’s kinda anti-climactic, I know. She actually made him breakfast the next morning. I’ll never forget that fact. And mostly because it’s an embarrassing fact to admit. It’s not how I thought the story would play out. It’s somehow worse. But it was out in the open. And once that was done, I was left alone feeling like a liar because I had a secret, one that I kept from my mother, and my father, and my family, my friends, and you, all of you, professionally, personally. And the secret is that I’m gay. Thank you for that. We love you. That’s very sweet. I really appreciate that. It means a lot. And I’m accepting the love, I really appreciate the love. My, kind of, ego wants to rebel against it, yo',\n",
              "  'u clap and you’re very sweet and you’re very kind, and I appreciate it. Part of me wants to be like: “I’m fucking gay.” “I’m not fucking retarded.” Because I can feel it, bro. I can feel it. There’s a lot that happens coming out. I’m telling you guys and I see the Yankee fitteds. Some of y’all are just like: “Shit, we at a gay show, bro?” This is for HBO. You know how many n*ggers just turned the TV off saying to their girl right now “we gotta watch something else”? Like, y’all clapped. A lot of you clapped and you felt it. Some of you didn’t really wanna clap. You were just like: “We gotta do that shit. We’re in New York and there’s cameras.” That’s okay, I get it. I came out to my friends. We love you. I wanna accept that, you know? It feels like I didn’t earn it. It’s like, what did I do, suck a Dominican dude’s dick? And then y’all clapped for that, you know? Because I rebelled against that. I really did, bro, I rebelled against it my whole life. I never thought I’d come out. I didn’t think I’d ever, ever, ever come out. Probably at many points in my life I thought I’d rather die than confront the truth of that. I didn’t actually say it to people, because I know it changes people’s, some people, it changes their perception of me. I can’t control that. I’m from an environment where I was, kind of, raised to be a man, whatever that means. Didn’t expect gay babies, you know what I’m saying? You don’t see old ladies looking at a toddler being, like: “Look at his cheeks. I bet he’s gonna be a top.” “Get that baby some prep now.” I feel you, bro. I’m with you. I’m from the hood. Sometimes I’ll be in the shower like: “N*gger, I’m really gay. Fuck, dude!” You know? Shit is shocking to me, too. I didn’t know. It’s fucked up all my relationships. I had a boyfriend, me and that n*gga talked to',\n",
              "  ' each other like men. We’d say shit like: “I wanna suck your dick, bro.” None of that gay shit over here. Sometimes we’re making out and just whispering “no homo” to each other. Just tonguing that n*gger down being, like, “pause”. I feel you. I got mostly straight friends. Them n*ggers didn’t wanna hear that shit. My homeboy, Jamar, said… This is one of my best friends. I let him sleep on my couch when he needed it. I was always there for him. He told me he felt like he was tricked into having a gay best friend. He said: “I would’ve never signed up for this.” And I said: “N*gger, you owe me 85000 dollars.” Gotta accept the love, man. I need the love. I need it. I was really out here lying, though. That’s the thing, I came out too late, a little too late. That “it gets better shit is for the kids”. That’s not for an adult man figuring himself out. They don’t want that. Nobody wants that shit. All my friends felt like I was just duplicitous, like I was just lying to them. They didn’t know who I was. They all reacted like Sally Field in Mrs. Doubtfire. They were like: “The whole time?” They were very mad about that shit. It cleared up my relationship with all my black homegirls. My friend Ashley told me before I came out she could sense it. She was like: “Please just tell me you’re gay so this all makes sense.” I guess there are only so many times you can Facetime a woman to see if your outfit looks okay before they start having some questions. They were the toughest. Black women were the toughest people to come out to, but also the most supportive. I’m very, very thankful for all of the black ladies in my life who have supported me through that, through all of it, all of it. They’re not homophobic at all. They’re racist as a motherfucker. They don’t like that I had a white boyfriend. See?',\n",
              "  ' You see what I’m saying? You see that change? You can be gay, but n*gger, what? You date white boys, really? Is that a shock? Surprise, surprise. No more secrets. I’m gonna tell you all. You heard her say “wow”? That’s the sound of a Black woman that feels doubly betrayed. My sister is on that shit, too. Listen, I’m used to it. I grew up just in the hood on some real strong masculine shit. It plays out. Look, I’ll say this, I actually think that it is important to say this, I believe in the black family. I think that black men should marry black women, and have black babies and raise them to be smart, just good citizens, educated. I think that’s very, very important. A hundred percent. I think gay black men should be able to fuck whoever the fuck we want. What is the consequence? There are no black babies coming from the kind of sex I have, okay? It’s all getting flushed. It doesn’t matter. Doesn’t matter. The black girls, they try. I would send them pictures of my boyfriend and they would ignore that he’s white. They would just be like… I remember I sent a picture to my homegirl Tiffany and she was like: “He got some pretty glasses.” I was like: “Nah, bitch, it’s not the glasses.” “Look at the skin of my vanilla king.” I didn’t call him that. I’m hiding nothing from you guys. But your name. Now you guys are too much like my family. Let’s go back to the audience-performer relationship we had before. It’s a lot. I’m really happy we had this moment of… My brother texted me earlier today and said: “I’m missing my first special taping,” “but I know it’s necessary. I love you.” That’s very sweet. I love him. He’s there for me as much as he can be. He tries. He tries and I love him. I love him a lot. I love Joe so much. He’s all I got in a lot of this. I wish he’d try harder. I’m probably a ',\n",
              "  'little mad at him, a little bit mad. He’s my big brother, he’s supposed to protect me. He loves me despite, that’s the thing. It’s a little condescending, you know? It’s love with an asterisk. “I don’t really fuck with the gay shit, but I still love you.” That’s that masculine shit. I could feel the distance between us. And I hate that because no one would want that. It makes me feel unwanted. It makes me feel like something is wrong with me. It’s like he’s looking down on me and accepting me despite. It’s especially hurtful just because I make so much more money than this n*gger. It’s not even close. I don’t wanna be gross and talk about money, but the difference is millions and millions of dollars. I love my brother a lot. He’s a nice guy. Nice as… I’m saying that. He has five kids who I love a lot, a lot. My nieces mean a lot to me. My oldest niece, Joliette, she’s fourteen now and I like talking to her. I think she’s so smart and she’s really beautiful. Her face reminds me of my mom’s. I have a five-year-old niece and then four-year-old twin nieces and I love them. I like spending time with them because I’m not hiding anything when I’m with them, I’m just with them. We’re just there playing. We’re just eating ice cream or they’re trying to braid my hair. They are easy to talk about it with, you know? Joliette, there’s no pre-tense. It’s harder with the older ones. I came out to my dad again. I say again, cause he forgets. It’s cognitive dissonance. I have to remind him. I have to re-up every so often. There’s a part of him that likes that I came out. I don’t think he necessarily wants a gay son, but he likes that me coming out takes some of the heat off him. Like when he first found out he was like “no, it’s cool”, “I fucked up, you fucked up”. “You gay, I did what I did… Que sera…”',\n",
              "  ' My father’s dream is that I’m bi. That’s all he wants. That’s all he wants, the hope, somewhere on the horizon, that I’m still getting pussy. That’s all he wants. He’s probably actually disappointed in both of me and my brother. He’s probably looking at us like: “Wait, so you gay and you only fuck your wife?” “What kinda nerds am I raising here?” I told my dad, I said: “I know two things for a fact.” “I will never be an astronaut and I’m a gay man.” And you know what my father said? He said: “Don’t give up on the moon, son.” I hid it from my mom for the most part. I was afraid that her reaction would be to just go inside with it. I love her a lot. I love her dearly. And I’m trying to describe her without sounding cliché and describe the love that I have for her. I really feel like I was one of her closest friends. I feel like I have always looked out for her. I remember on the call, the last time I talked about being gay with my Mom, she said: “I can’t go against Jesus.” And it just bothers me. I get it, cause she’s… She’s doing the best she can. I think. She’s trying to accept. I don’t know what she’s trying to do. I think she’s trying to accept it. Part of me knows she’s at home trying to pray the gay away. I get a little mad sometimes. Any time I don’t match with a dude on RIA I’m like: “I bet that bitch over there praying to God.” I feel it too. It fucks with me because this is a religion that I still believe in. I’m still a Christian and it’s taken a lot, it’s taken a whole lot because I’ve had to reconfigure God and what God is and what he means in order to accept myself. I had to kind of rebuild. And with my mom… I’m sorry. A lot of it is not really… It’s kinda happening in real time, so it’s not totally worked out. Forgive me. I think she’s… She thinks not reacting is the best ',\n",
              "  'reaction. I think she’s been rewarded for staying quiet, you know? It’s like with her dad, so she gives me nothing. Even hate starts to feel like love because that’s acknowledgement. It’s not just nice. It’s not pleasant, it’s real and that feels… I think that would feel better. I wish she would yell at me. I wish she would tell me to not come home. I wish she’d call me a f*ggot like my Uncle June Bug did. Yeah. It hurt my feelings, but I was like: “N*gga, your name June Bug.” I’d rather get called a f*ggot than June Bug. Anything, anything, anything. She’s nice. She’s sweet. She ignores it. The worst of her is cold, like really, really cold. I mean she’s a nice lady, but like, there’s a part of her that’s really… She can shut people out. She can ignore, she can block and like, go inside. But you gave yourself so many years. Why don’t you give her that time? I’d love to give her all the time in the world, you know? I don’t know how much time it would take. I don’t know how much time we have left. Just in general, one of my biggest fears is my parents funeral, just the thought of one them dying without saying everything, without contending, without expressing it all. And my mom’s in her early sixties and she has time and she’s… I also just don’t know if that’s when people change. They do. Maybe. I don’t know. It sounds like a joke, but like part of me feels like if I ask my mom to change this much about her is like, you ever see a 90-year-old get a college degree? On the news… And you’re like: “Bitch, now?” “Good luck in the fucking job market.” It’s not that I don’t find hope for change, but I think even if she was young, there’s a part of my mom that’s very, very cold. I know it because I have it, I can be that. That’s why my last real secret is that I’m… People think I’m nice. Nah, I’',\n",
              "  'm like my Mom. Fuck everybody. Very selfish. Very, very, very, very selfish. I smile. Very polite about it. I lie to everybody face. “Yeah, we should get dinner!” You know, lies. How you lie to people? I’m afraid of not… Man, just like my Mom, is that performance of like who you’re supposed to be. Like I’m afraid of not smiling. I smile a lot. I feel like if I don’t smile, I look like the n*ggers that shot Malcom X. I know. I’m afraid of things getting awkward. Like weird. Like even this moment, I’m like “man, I should probably think of a joke”. Shit is falling apart out here. Do you wish you didn’t tell her? No, no. I stayed in the closet for a long time. I think because of my mom I felt like… It’s not like I could bring a dude home to her, so what’s the point? But as much as she believes in God, I believe in personal growth and feeling free. I feel freer. We say things like: “Sometimes you grow and you gotta leave people behind.” “People are in your life for a reason or a season.” Or these kinds of cliché sayings. It’s hard when that person is your mom. You think a lot of the guilt is your dad’s guilt? I carry some guilt. I think because I was complicit in the lie, I guess. I thought I was protecting her. I always felt like my mom’s protector. I always felt like… I’m trying to explain this concept. I always felt like… I always felt like the result of her prayers. My mom, one of her favorite Bible verses is, I think it’s Jeremiah Chapter 33: “Ask me and I will tell you things you don’t know and can’t find out.” Do you think without your mom’s approval you’ll be okay? That eventually this will be something that you’ll be okay with? I think without my mom’s approval… I’d like to believe I will be okay. I think I’ve spent a lot of time trying to supplement that love and I’m very thankful ',\n",

And– Another hand for the most overqualified opening act, Mr. Lewis Black. [cheering] And another hand for Jann Arden, who couldn’t be here to sing that in real life but was nice enough to send that to me in the computer. And a big hand for you people that are borderline alcoholics. You’ve made it out tonight. [cheering] You’ve– [cheering continues] I do feel a kinship. This is a beer town. I’m from a beer town. I’m actually from St. Louis, Missouri. [cheering] Thank you. You like that. Specifically, I’m from very near Ferguson. Maybe you saw our travel brochure. People are like, “Really? Are you really from there?” Yeah, I am. They’re like, “Can you believe all that happened?” Yeah, I can. I can’t believe we kept a lid on that shit for 25 years. Every day I felt the tension. Every day. Even In high school, I came home and I said, “I don’t really know if our school’s that safe anymore, Dad. A girl got stabbed to death in the third-floor bathroom.” He didn’t stop doing the crossword puzzle. He goes, “Well, don’t use that bathroom. What are you, a goddamn idiot, Kathleen? Jesus Christ. Use your mind.” It’s not a very exciting state, Missouri. It’s really just in the middle– Clearly, though, to Southerners it’s not. I was in Birmingham, Alabama. I get done with the show, and this guy at the bar goes, “Ma’am, I could tell by the way you talk you’re a Yankee.” I’m like, “Sir, I’m from Missouri. And let me tell you this little piece of history. I don’t even know if we were in the war. I think we were half and half and just beat the crap out of one another. We never even left our own property, sir.” “Fight Local.” That was our bumper sticker. “Fight Local.” ’Cause we couldn’t decide. We were half Confederate and half Union. We still can’t decide. CNN had a map of the Syrian refugee crisis, a map of the United States, and who would take them and who wouldn’t. The South, yellow. No. The Northeast said yes, we’ll take ’em. Blue. For no reason explained till the very end of the show, Missouri was purple. The only state. And then at the end, they go, “Oh, the purple signifies no decision. They can’t make up their minds.” Of course we can’t make up our minds. I don’t really consider, um– I don’t know what I consider. I don’t know if it’s north or south. But I know sometimes when I’m in the South, I see things on bumper stickers, I read things in their newspaper where I think to myself, seriously, I think we may need to have this Civil War again. I’m not sure they got it. I feel like it’s beating up a drunk in an alley and then wake up and be like, “That was bullshit. I wasn’t ready. Come back.” No. No, drunky. We’re not coming back. I was in Louisiana, and you can google this. ’Cause I couldn’t believe this was true. It is true. They are teaching children in schools in Louisiana that will accept vouchers. So that’s tax money. They’re private schools, but they accept vouchers. This is in science class. Now, put on your science hat and try to follow this syllogism. They’re teaching the kids that the Loch Ness Monster is real. Now, as an aside, I agree with that. But nobody taught me that. I had to stay up really late watching the Discovery Channel, drinking a lot of wine and weeding through a lot of crap to make my decision. Anyway, they’re teaching the children that the Loch Ness Monster is real. Therefore, evolution is not real ’cause the Loch Ness Monster is a d',\n",
              "  'inosaur. I don’t even have a joke for that. I just want you to know that. Those are fellow Americans that I think should be airlifted out. I– Someone needs to get the children. Leave the adults. Take the children. My state is not a state that you really wanna brag about. We just try to lay low. That’s our best outcome: if we’re not noticed. Because every time– Like Ferguson, that whole thing. That was not exactly something that you feel proud of. Uh, two summers ago, I turned on CNN somewhere on the road, and it said, “Missouri State Senate debates–” Now, you think the next word would be “health care” or “right-to-work clause.” No. “Noodling.” Yeah. We spent two weeks, eight hours a day, the senate. For those of you who don’t know what noodling is, congratulations. You have led a very classy life. But I’m gonna tell you what it is. Noodling is when hillbilly people get in muddy rivers, like the Mississippi or the Missouri River, and they get into water about chest high and then they go along the riverbank with their hands underneath the water searching for catfish breeding holes. Then when they find one, they shove their arm in the hole. They wait for the catfish to bite it. Then they yank it out and they’ve caught a fish. I was not aware that this is illegal in my home state of Missouri. I was also not aware that it is legal in our neighboring state of Oklahoma. I certainly was not aware that we have a Missouri Noodlers Association. CNN sent a young reporter to interview the president of the Missouri Noodlers Association, who immediately became my new hero because for his interview on CNN, he chose not to wear a shirt. [audience cheering] She was clearly petrified of the guy. I have never seen anyone hold a microphone further away from another human being. She said, “Sir, I understand you’re the president of the Missouri Noodlers Association. Could you please tell us your position on noodling?” He goes, “Yeah. Yeah. I’ll tell you my position. If I wanna shove my arm in a hole and get a fish, you tell my why I can’t.” So that was the argument for it. Then I thought, what is the problem? I don’t know. Well, they go interview the people against it. It was, like, basically an environmental group, and they go, “Well, our problem with it is two-fold. Number one, every time they do this, they’re destroying the catfish breeding holes. And number two, and more importantly, sometimes these catfish, especially if near a dam, can grow to be 150 to 250 pounds.” Yes. I swear. Google it. “So sometimes when the hillbilly shoves his arm in the hole, the hillbilly does not come back up.” But I was like, “Yeah, but let’s think that through. What have we gained and what have we lost?” Everything– [applause] “We might have lost Billy Bob, but somebody just got his brand-new truck full of Busch light.” What? I don’t expect people to know much about Missouri. I do expect people to know it’s a state. That I do. And there are people– I was in California, in a Macy’s, trying to buy jeans. And the girl was young, I’ll give her that. [imitating valley girl] She was one of the girls who talk like that, and she just couldn’t be bothered with anything, okay? [normal voice] I go to check out and I give her my credit card. She goes, “I’m gonna need to see your license.” I go, “Okay, that’s not a problem.” And I– I’m still not sure exactly what happened. I’m gonna show you what happened. I gave her my license, and she went, “Missouri.” [clicks teeth] “Uh… no.” “No? Did you just do a search in your brain and your hard drive came back with nothing, so you negated my whole state?” “Uh, no.” Missouri is a very special place to one group of people, and it’s the Mormons. Not the ones that went to Utah. Joseph Smith, the leader, had a son, Joseph Smith, Jr. That man believed that the original Garden of Eden was 35 miles north of Kansas City. Not in Mesopotamia. ',\n",
              "  'No, no, no, no, no. Missouri. They also believe that when Christ comes back, that’s where he’s going. First stop, Kansas City. He’s not gonna go to Bethlehem or Jerusalem. He’s getting a Southwest flight and he’s going straight to Kansas City. Look, I am from Missouri. And if you think Jesus is going back to Kansas City, 35 miles outside of it, by the way, then you must believe that Jesus is a big fan of barbecue and crystal meth, because that is what’s happening 35 miles outside of Kansas City. My whole family lives there. Well, my parents are in Florida in the winter right now. As most Midwest old people with a car, they leave on December 26. They’re like geese. They just leave. Flocks of ’em leave from the Midwest. My parents bought a new car. They haven’t had a new car in ten years. They bought a black Lincoln Town Car. Little did they know that that’s one of the more expensive rides on the Uber app. So I, unbeknownst to them, have signed them up to be Uber drivers… so they can pick up other old people on the way to Florida, make a little spending cash. ’Cause my mom will do whatever the phone says, I’m telling you. “Jack, we have to pull over. We’re the blue dot, and it’s saying pull over. There are people that need a ride for some reason. I don’t know why the phone is doing this. It’s never done this before. But I’m afraid if we don’t, there’s gonna be a problem, Jack.” They go to Sarasota now, on that side. But for about three years in a row, they went to a place called the Villages. I don’t know if any of you’ve seen it advertised on TV. Go to their Web site. There’s nothing like it in the world. It’s the largest retirement community in the nation. Well, the world, probably. It’s 35 minutes, or if my mom’s driving, eight and a half hours away from the Orlando airport. Some guy thought of it. He thought, “I’m gonna buy all of this crappy swampland, and I’m gonna make nirvana for old people. I’ll build it. They will come.” And they came. There’s 350,000 of ’em. They have their own zip code. They have their own post office. They’ve got golf courses, swimming pools. I mean, it’s really something. It really is something. And my parents were there, and I go, “Oh, good. You’re gonna be at the Villages. That’s great, ’cause I have shows in Florida, and I have nowhere to go in between shows.” My mom goes, “You can come over here, but you can’t spend the night on the property.” I said, “Why not?” She goes, “The law at the Villages, Kathleen, is no one under the age of 55 is allowed to spend the night on the property.” I said, “Really? Fifty-five? So you’re telling me at age 48, I’m gonna have to again go get a fake ID– [audience laughing] so that I can spend the night with you freaks. Mom, where would I even go? To, like, a bingo game and roll an old redheaded lady and go, ‘Sorry. I’ll have this back in two days. I just need it to get into the Villages.’” I said, “Mom, how are they gonna know if I’m there? Seriously. Does an old man come in a golf cart and do bed check every night?” She goes, “Yes. That’s what I’ve heard. Yes. That’s what I think happens.” I said, “Well, I’m going to come there and I am gonna spend the night. But I will meet you halfway so you’re not nervous. I’m gonna sleep in my tennis shoes, sports bra and T-shirt and shorts. And if I hear the golf cart, I’m gonna get up, and I’m gonna run into the family room, and I’m gonna hide behind the La-Z-Boy. ’Cause in my own mind, Mom, I’m gonna pretend like I’m in the last scene of The Sound of Music and we’re the Von Trapps on top of the convent hiding behind tombstones… from the Nazis. And then when the golf cart guy shines his flashlight, just for my own amusement, I’m gonna pop out from behind it and go, ‘Don’t do it, Ralph. You’re not one of them. Don’t take us. Come with us.’ And then I’m gonna laugh and laugh. He won’t laugh, but I don’t care. It’s not th',\n",
              "  'e point. I’m gonna laugh. And then I’m gonna run by him, Mom, and I’m gonna run away, and I’m gonna make it over the whole border of the Villages. I’m gonna make it to freedom, and– Do you know how I know I’m confident I can do that? Because I’m the only person out of 350,000 that has both of their real knees, Mom. I am the Usain Bolt of this community. I don’t think you’re respecting my powers.” Prepared to getting older, there’s moments where you’re hanging out with them and you’re like, “Wow. Are you actually going crazy in front of me? Like, should I call someone? I don’t know what to do.” I was in Target with my mom. She opened her wallet and all her credit cards were individually wrapped in tin foil. She unwraps one and hands it to me as if that’s a completely normal exchange of information. I go, “We’re not gonna talk about that?” She goes, “Talk about what, Kathleen?” I go, “The tin foil, Mom. The tin foil.” She goes, “Well, obviously, you have not been keeping up with the news.” I said, “No, I actually thought I had been.” “Well, then you must have missed the story about the raygun people.” “Who are the raygun people?” She said, “Well, your father and I saw it on ‘20-40’ or ‘60-80’ or ‘100 Minutes,’ whatever those serious– It was a very serious program. There are people now, Kathleen, with computer rayguns, and they can shoot that raygun through my purse, through my wallet, and they gather all of your personal information off of that strip on the back of your debit card. They can shoot through your father’s ass at a gas station, right through his ass, into his wallet.” I went, “Okay.” My mom’s not stupid. She was a nurse for a million years. So I called my friend in Boston who’s been a cop forever, and I asked him about the raygun people and told him about the tin foil. He said, “Two things, Kathleen. Number one, no. I have not heard about the raygun people. But in fairness to your mom, I haven’t checked my work e-mail in three days. Now– Number two, and more importantly, what I do know from being a cop for 20 years is that crazy people love tin foil. You don’t need to tell your mother. I’m just telling you so you know that is a fact. An old cop told me that. Always carry tin foil in your squad car. If you come across someone who’s mentally ill and having a psychotic break or maybe someone in a drug frenzy, you just tear off a piece of tin foil, you calmly walk over and go, ‘Make a hat,’ and the whole situation–” They drive to Florida ’cause my mom won’t fly anymore. The fear of flying has literally gone over the edge with her. It started years ago. And I do feel sorry for people who have that fear, ’cause it is real. And you see people at airports. You can always tell. ’Cause their hands, their palms are real sweaty. They’ll talk to anyone. God forbid the time of departure changes. Then they completely unravel. They’re like, “This is it. I think this plane’s broken, and they’re gonna fly it. Don’t you?” “Yeah, I do. Today is the day. American Airlines is gonna go, ‘Fuck it. Give it a whirl. I don’t care.’ Wha– Every part can’t be that important.” But it’s weird to me that strangers– There will always be a stranger who will say to another stranger, “Oh, you shouldn’t have a fear of flying, because I’ll tell you what, you have a better chance of being in a car crash than you do of being in a plane crash.” And I wanna say, but I won’t ’cause it would be mean, “Yeah, but you have a much better chance of getting in a forgettable car crash than you do of being in a forgettable plane crash.” There’s no way you’re gonna be in a plane crash, go to work on Monday, and then Wednesday look at somebody you work with and go, “Oh, shit, did I forget to tell you? On the way home from Milwaukee, my plane crashed. I don’t know if you saw that on CNN. I was the lady running through the cornfield. My hair had caught on fire because ',\n",
              "  'I’m near-sighted and I’d lost my glasses in the turbulence. I actually ran towards the explosion versus away from the explosion. That’s why I called in sick yesterday ’cause… my head hurt ’cause it had been on fire.” I fly every week, and I’ve never even thought about what if something happened to the plane until missing Malaysian Flight 370, which I am admittedly obsessed with. My youngest brother, who I talk to almost every day, has banned me from speaking about it. He goes, “Seriously, Kathleen, if you bring it up, I’m gonna hang up. It’s been almost two years. I don’t wanna hear anything that you’ve read on the Internet. I don’t wanna hear what you and your drunk friends decided happened to it. I–” He goes, “You’ve never been obsessed with a plane crash.” “Ah, ah, ah. What is the problem with that sentence, Pat? You just said ‘plane crash.’ We don’t know if this plane crashed, do we?” That’s– That’s why I’m obsessed with it. About seven months ago, they found a wing of a Triple Seven in the Indian Ocean. That’s what that plane was, a Triple Seven. And they sent that wing to the French. I do not know why the French are in charge of science. I’d have given it to the Germans. But whatever. They actually came out and said, “Well, yeah, um, this definitely is the wing of a Triple Seven, but we cannot confirm it’s missing Malaysian Flight 370.” “Well, has anyone else called… Lost and Found… looking for a wing?” They found another little piece, like, three days ago. But all it says is that– It just says, “Do not step here.” So it could be that or a ladder. Who kno– Nobody– Nobody knows. I watched every minute of the coverage, and my brother goes, “I don’t get it.” I go, “Because it’s the biggest news story of our lifetime, Patrick.” I’m sorry. I’ve assumed my entire life that when we bought a ticket in an airplane to go over a large body of water, I thought the whole time we were up here, someone smarter than us on the ground at all times knew where the fuck we were. I did. I believed that. Yeah, well, that’s certainly not the case. Cat is out of the bag. They got nothing. Boston to Dublin, Texas, when you get there, man. It gets a little weird after Nova Scotia. They don’t tell people that. As soon as you get a Guinness, give us a holler and let us know everything’s all right. They covered it on CNN for 72 days, and people were complaining it’s too much coverage. I’m like, “No, it’s not. This is wonderful.” ’Cause they have no new information, so now they just have to make up conversation. It got to the point where the experts were, like, building paper airplanes, going, “Okay, here’s what I think happened, all right? It was windy. Come on. Turn on the fan. Stay with me, Bob. Somebody put water in the trash can. That’s my ocean. Come on.” But I watched it, because every day they would go live to the city of Kuala Lumpur to a Hilton hotel for a press conference from the Malaysian Airlines spokesman. I have never felt so sorry for any individual in their job. Because every day he had no new information. And he had to face a ballroom full of Chinese people. ’Cause there were 239 missing people. Most were Chinese. Their families have been flown in. He couldn’t even make eye contact. He would just come out and go, “Brrrr. Ah, ha, yeah. Well, uh, once again, I have new no information on Flight 370. It’s a very bad situation. We cannot find our airplane. We have called Australia. They’re gonna help us look for our airplane. Sometimes you lose something. You can’t find it, and you have to ask for help. ‘Hey, have you seen my keys?’ That’s the kind of situation. Sorry.” Then he would leave. I’m like, “This is a real airline. They’re open. Today. I check every day. I google. This is a real working airline.” And the Chinese people were so kind, I thought. Like in patient. He would come out day after day. There’s nothing. There was very',\n",
              "  ' little reaction. Week three he came out. “Ah, brrrr. Ah, yeah, once again, I have no new information on flight. We still cannot find our airplane. It’s a really, really, really bad situation. We do know this now though. We have been looking in the wrong ocean. Ha ha!” What? What? What? What? “Ah, yeah, that ocean wrong. Maybe now over here. We’re gonna look over here in this ocean.” What? The wrong ocean? That is an acceptable statement in the year 1492 regarding a boat. “I don’t know where it went, man. I told you the world was flat. Maybe it just fell off. I don’t know.” That is not an acceptable statement in the year 2014. Unbelievable. And once again, the Chinese people, they just didn’t really react. And I thought, “Oh, my God. That’s– That’s the day where my Irish temper– Every– Every single valve would have burst.” I could’ve had a can of Aqua Net and a lighter, and that man would have burst into a pillar of fire. A biblical pillar of fire on CNN International. And I would’ve done it knowing full well I’m gonna be arrested and tried for murder, which would’ve been fine. And I would say, “Yes, please let me take the witness stand.” ’Cause I don’t care what question I’m asked. I have a two-word answer. “Miss Madigan, is it true that you took Aqua Net and a lighter into the ballroom?” “Huh. Wrong ocean. Ha!” “Wrong ocean.” Unbelievable. The Chinese people, though, are still pretty kind. Day 72, for those of you who are not obsessed with missing airplanes, um, that’s the last day of hope because the ping device can no longer possibly operate. There’s the black box and then there’s a ping thing that emits a sonar sound. Now, this is assuming one had put batteries in their ping device. Yeah. Google this. About five months ago, they had a little secret announcement ’cause they thought everybody forgot. “Ah, yeah, one more thing. Ha ha. About that airplane. Um, we never had batteries in that. Yeah. Sorry. Well, you know, sometimes at home your remote control, your batteries go dead, and you go to a different remote control, and you take those batteries and you put ’em in this remote control. And then later on, you go for the other old one. You go, ‘Uh-oh. I forgot.’ That’s what happened. Sorry.” They are open. So day 72. At the time the Chinese people don’t know that there’s– They don’t know there’s no batteries. They believe there were batteries in it. He comes out, and I thought, “Whatever you do, just don’t say it the same way. Phrase it differently.” No. No. He came out, “Brrrr. Ah, ha, yeah, once again, I have no new information on Flight 370.” And finally, the Chinese people lost their minds. An old man, like, rolls back, flicked a lit cigarette at that man’s head, live on TV. Sadly, my first thought was, “Wow. You can still smoke inside… in a Hilton in Malaysia.” Note to self: Vacation in Kuala Lumpur. Take different airline. Check Southwest. That airline’s ridiculous. And then the older women started losing it. Like, literally, having heart attacks. 911 is being called. It’s bedlam. They have finally reached their maximum potential of patience. They’re out of it. I happen to be home watching it with my parents. My dad, who does not like public displays of emotion, was like, “Oh, my God. Jesus Christ. They got to get it together. They got to get it together. Do they know they’re on television? Are they aware that people can see?” My mom interrupts with– And I have six siblings. “Well, Jack, you have to understand it’s extra sad for the Chinese people because they only have one child.” I go, “Hold on a second. So are you saying, Mom, it would only be a seventh as sad if I went missing forever?” “Yes, that’s what I’m saying. Yes. You may not wanna hear that, but that’s the truth. I mean, we have six other children. They have children. Your father and I have casino buffet tickets. We are leading a full life.” Yes, you ',\n",
              "  'are. Seven kids. It’s too many. Nobody notices though. That’s a good thing. If you’re one of seven, no one notices anything. Like, I’m surprised– I have friends who have one or two kids. They speak to them about their feelings and their thoughts, and they address them individually. ’Cause my friends are like, “Oh, you guys didn’t?” “No.” No. Not with seven kids. There were just announcements made. That’s all. “We’re moving.” “Oh, fuck. What? What? What? When?” “Your mother’s already in the car. I don’t know what’s going on with you people.” Nobody notices when you’re one of seven. Which was fine with me. I didn’t mind that. I would still choose that. But sometimes to the point of, “Really, guys?” I do not watch myself on TV. I was 35 years old, and I walked into my parents’ house, and they somehow had me on their TV, and I looked at it and I go, “Ah. What is wrong with my eye?” My dad goes, “You mean your lazy one?” “What? What?” “Yeah, your right eye. When you get tired or nervous, it twitches and kind of jumps around. You– You don’t feel that happening?” “No. No, I didn’t know. I didn’t know that was happening. How long has that been going on?” “I mean, since you were a baby. I mean, they, uh… told us to put a patch on you, but you can’t have a baby girl pirate. That’s crazy. So, uh… we thought you’d grow out of it, quite frankly, and clearly you have not, Kathleen. So if I were you, before you go on television, I would get a nap or calm down, ’cause it’s–” I didn’t really know how small families worked till I got to go over to other friends’ houses. When you’re in second grade or whatever, my friend across the street, Bob, he would say, “That’s my mom and that’s my sister.” And I’m like, “Well, where is everyone?” Like, I don’t wanna say anything. Maybe there was a house fire or, you know, some sort of tragedy. But this is weird. I think smaller families are kinder. They say kinder things. I don’t know if they mean them, but I heard “I love you” a lot. “I love you.” “love you too.” “Love you more than yesterday.” “Ha! Love you more than tomorrow.” And it’s not even today. I would just stand there paralyzed and uncomfortable. “You guys don’t say ‘I love you’?” “No.” There are nine people in my house. Saying “I love you” would be a sign of weakness. They need to wake up and wonder how I feel about their ass. I’m not giving them that. And at this age if I walked into a room and all my siblings were sitting there and they started to say “I love you,” I’d run out because I would know this is some sort of intervention, and I’m not falling for that. I’m not listening to your dumb-ass sad letter. “Dear Kathleen.” We went to Catholic schools. Uh, yeah, I didn’t mind. [man] Whoo! If I had kids, I would make them go to a Catholic school, ’cause I’ll tell you, the one thing I guarantee you, if you send your kids to a Catholic school, they will never join ISIS. Somebody would’ve said to me at age 18 after all that Catholicism, “Hey, could we talk to you about our religion for a minute?” Ha ha ha ha ha ha! “No, you may not. You are 18 years late to this party, Muhammad. You–” [Kathleen chuckling] I think being Catholic is Christian, but it’s been pointed out to me many times in the South that they’re not the same. ’Cause in the South, they’ll go, “Oh, are you Christian?” I’ll go, “Yeah, I’m Catholic.” “Oh, well, we’re Christian.” “Oh, okay. I thought we said the same thing, but I guess not.” There are differences. The Christians have a direct relationship with Jesus. They speak of it like that. “You know what? Me and my relationship with Jesus. I love Jesus. Jesus loves me.” It’s a direct, very solid relationship with Jesus. And I thought, “Wow. Really? You guys go straight to Jesus.” In a Catholic school, I was given a laundry list of people to contact… before, the nuns said, because otherwise I’m bothering Jesus. “You are gonna cal',\n",
              "  'l these people, Kathleen, before you bother Jesus. You could start with your guardian angel. He’s got nothing to do 24 hours a day except tend to your needs. If he’s not available, you can speak to the saint in charge of the activity you’re upset about. Every single saint has been assigned an assignment. You can speak to Jesus’ mother if you’d like to. You can give Mary a shout. But you are not to bother Jesus.” Okeydokey. Even if I did something bad, I couldn’t tell Jesus. I had to go to confession. I had to get in a creepy closet with a guy in the dark. And then I had to tell him, and he’s gonna tell a guy. And I wasn’t good at confession because my dad, for many years, was a defense attorney. And starting in second grade, he would tell us all at the dinner table, “I want all of you kids to remember if the police capture you or anyone in a position of authority ask you questions, your response, no matter what, are ‘I do not recall, I need an attorney. I do not recall, I need an attorney.’ Ninety percent of people are in prison because they can’t keep their goddamn mouths shut. Never, ever snitch on yourself.” And then I would go to confession in the closet, and the priest would go, “Kathleen, have you done anything bad? Is there anything you’d like to tell me about?” [Kathleen chuckles] I’m not falling for this. My dad’s probably planted him here. I know– I know what I’m supposed to say. “I’m sorry, Father, but I do not recall and I need an attorney.” “Honey, you’re only in second grade.” “Well, maybe you don’t know this, Father Anthony, but 90% of people are in prison because they can’t keep their goddamn mouths shut. If you’d like some more information on that–” If you’re from a big family, you know you never say anything directly to the sibling that you intend on saying something till you say it to a different sibling. They’ll say it to another, and then eventually it’ll get back to the sibling you intended it to say. I, uh– This year at Christmas, my brother said, “You should be on time because last year you were late.” And he said that our other sister said I ruined Christmas. I go, “Really? Did she say that? I ruined it? I’m calling her.” I go, “Did you say I ruined Christmas?” [scoffs] “Well, I might’ve. I mean, you were late. Everybody knew to get there at 9:30. You didn’t get there until 10:00. The kids were all excited. Everyone was excited. We had to wait ’cause you had to stop–” I go, “Okay, I agree. I was late. I apologize for that. But I would like to point out for the future that I think you and I have very different definitions of what ruining Christmas would be.” To me, ruining Christmas would be if I would’ve walked into Mom and Dad’s house with a 12-gauge shotgun and shot them in the face. I think that ruins Christmas. It ruins the rest of the Christmases after that, ’cause you can’t ever have another Christmas without going, “Oh, my God. Remember that one Christmas when Kathleen went crazy and shot Mom and Dad in the face? It was horrible.” My siblings have tons of kids. They’re everywhere. I don’t have any, and I’m glad I don’t. I don’t have the pressure of naming the kids. That’s awful. My youngest brother, his name is John Patrick Madigan. That’s my dad’s name, and that name has been in our family since 1853, circa Ireland, as far as we can count back. And then my youngest brother knew that they were having a boy, and he called and said, “You know what? I’m not gonna do it.” I go, “You’re not gonna name him John Patrick Madigan?” He goes, “No.” I go, “Well, I’ve never asked you for anything, but I would like to know when and where you’re going to be telling Dad this information, because I’m gonna bring a cooler of beer ’cause that’s how long his answer’s gonna be, Pat, and it’s gonna involve the whole history of Ireland and what’s wrong with English people and they were actually potatoes, but they ',\n",
              "  'never gave ’em to the people and Henry VIII. Wha– Why– Why would you pick this fight? Your name is John Patrick Madigan. We call you Patrick. His is John Patrick Madigan. We call him Jack. Grandpa was John Patrick Madigan. We call him– You can call him Fuck Nut. Just name him. This is a crazy fight, in my mind. Don’t– You’d have a better time telling Dad you’re gonna become a woman. Seriously. ’Cause Mom would smooth it over ’cause you’re the baby. Everyone in LA’s doing it. Bruce Jenner. Cher’s son.” I said, “Why? Why, Patrick? Why?” He goes, “You don’t know what it’s like to live with somebody else’s name. Exact same name.” He goes, “You know, I cannot get Direct TV because Dad won’t pay their bill.” What? I go, “They don’t even have Direct TV.” “Oh, no, not anymore. They did. Four years ago.” That’s how long the standoff’s been going on. It’s over a movie that Dad claims he didn’t rent. They’ve paid everything but that charge, but that charge has penalties. So it’s now $287. And I said, “Well, just pay the bill. I’ll pay it.” He goes, “No, I could pay it too. But I can’t pay it ’cause he won’t give me the account information. Because he doesn’t wanna pay it.” I go, “What was the movie, just out of curiosity?” He goes, “Lincoln, starring Daniel Day-Lewis. And if you like to hear that speech, call him, Kathleen.” “Why would I rent Abraham Lincoln? Has something new happened? Do we have new information? Did John Wilkes Booth not shoot Abraham Lincoln? I never ordered goddamn Lincoln . I know it.” I said, “All right. Well, if you’re not gonna do that, what other names were you guys thinking of?” He goes, “Well, a lot. But here’s a little left-field one. Maybe Seamus.” And I went, “Seamus Madigan?” He goes, “Why is that funny to you?” I go, “I don’t know. But we should pay attention to that.” I just laughed for no reason. I go, “I think names have power. If you’re gonna name him Seamus Madigan, I think you should lower all expectations.” Seamus Madigan is a bartender. He always was a bartender. He will always be a bartender. I don’t think he’s gonna be a heart surgeon. And if he was, I wouldn’t let him operate on me, even if he was my nephew. If I was in some emergency room, they came out and said, “Your surgeon, Dr. Seamus Madigan, will be out in a minute,” I would be like, “No, he will not.” And I would wheel my ass down to the Jewish hospital, where there was a nice young man named Sam whose family took education more seriously than beer pong and football. That’s what I would do. I have no kids. I don’t– I don’t want them. I’ve seen what it’s done to some of my siblings. Oh, they’re so tired and cranky. My sister’s normally very happy. Has twins. She looks so tired. I go, “You look really tired.” “You don’t have to say that. I know I look tired. I am tired. I have four-year-olds. Did you know– I thought it was gonna get easier. It doesn’t. The average four-year-old asks 436 questions in a day. Did you know that? And I have two of ’em. And I’m too tired to add 436 plus 436. It’s a lot of questions, Kathleen.” I said, “Do you know why they ask 436? ’Cause you were dumb enough to answer the first question. That’s what led to that line of questioning. You got to shut it down.” If I have ’em, I’d throw ’em in the van in the morning. They’ll ask a random question. “Hey, Aunt Kat, how come their dog gets to be out front and ours doesn’t?” “Fuck if I know.” That’s the answer. Ask Siri. Siri has answers. Aunt Kat, no answers. [Kathleen chuckles] Here’s the biggest reason I would never wanna have a kid. ’Cause I will never again on my own or even assist on installing a car seat. I don’t know how many of you ever had to do this, but if you’re gonna, here’s a few helpful hints. Take the whole day off work, because that’s how long it’s gonna take you. Whatever your favorite alcohol is, have a bucket of it next to that minivan, ’cause ',\n",
              "  'you’re gonna stop and have to take drinks and re-read things. If you’re over the age of, oh, I’d say 30, at some point you’re going to become infuriated with Ralph Nader, ’cause he’s the one who started it all. I remember being in grade school and he was on 60 Minutes . “Seat belts. Everybody must have a seat belt. Car seat, seat belts, safety is for life. Head injuries are also for life. I have statistics.” Well, maybe you do, Ralph. I’m sure you do. But so do I. There were seven of us, Ralph. For 16 years, we rode around in the back of a station wagon completely untethered. Completely. And we were in accidents. A lot of them. Especially if my mom was driving. We– Sometimes we got hit so hard, I actually flew to a better seat than I’d originally secured. “Who’s got the window now, jackass?” That’s right. And that was with my parents chain-smoking in the car. Both of ’em. It was so smoky in that car. You could barely see other passengers. Seriously. They way, way back was like Studio 54, because the sun would hit the smoke and create patterns, and then I would draw patterns within the pattern because I didn’t have an iPad, so that’s what I would do to entertain myself. If you’re a woman and you’re gonna install a car seat, I would highly suggest you put on a sports bra, ’cause you’re gonna get hot. You’re gonna be so hot, you’re gonna start inadvertently just tearing off pieces of clothing. And if you’re not careful, you’ll end up like I did, in my sister’s driveway in my regular bra just drinking a beer, staring off into space. And the normally, very friendly neighbors came home. I’m trying to talk to ’em. I don’t know why they’re being so weird. And I’m like, “How you guys doing? Yeah, I know. I just came home. She had twins. I need two of these. I can’t– can’t figure it out. I’m so hot. I’m so hot. I would offer you a beer, but I only have three left. And I’ve made no progress.” So– I just found notes on the back– There’s factory notes that say if you don’t know how to do this, you can take it to the police or the fire department and they’ll install it for you. But unfortunately, I didn’t find those notes till after I already started drinking. So I don’t think it would be a good idea to drive to law enforcement, shit-faced, and two car seats and I don’t have any babies. I mean, It’s just too much to explain, right? Crazy. So this was what I was thinking. I was thinking I might set her car on fire. No, call the fire department, and then after they put the car out, I go, “Hey, since you’re all here, do you think you can give me a hook-up?” [man] Yeah! [chuckles] They’re a pain in the ass, to put kids in them, especially in winter with the coats and 70,000 buckles and the whole thing. And my brother’s kid I thought was big enough to not go in a car seat, and I said, “Do I do him too?” She’s just disgusted with my lack of any parenting knowledge. She goes, “Ugh. 4-foot-10, 80 pounds.” What? “That’s a Missouri state law, Kathleen. If you’re 4-foot-10 or shorter, 80 pounds or less, your ass is in a car seat versus a ticket from the Missouri State Highway Patrol.” I go, “Really, 4’10”? That is excellent news because right now I’m only 5-foot-1. The average woman, due to osteoporosis… in your life, you would have shrunk anywhere from two to five inches. I am not certain. I am bad at math. But I’m pretty sure that puts me back in a car seat. I can’t wait to be back in a car seat. All these nieces and nephews I have will be old enough to drive. I’m gonna do exactly what they do. I’ll call and say I need a ride. Then I’m gonna pack a big bag full of unnecessary, unrelated items that I have to have, or there is going to be a meltdown. Then, like the five and six-year-olds, I’m gonna get in the van and walk, on my own accord, to the very backseat, and I’m just gonna hop up in it like they do and wait for the great buckling. Just sit',\n",
              "  ' there. [mouthing words] Then I’m gonna let ’em buckle me in. Then I’m gonna let them pull away. And I’m gonna wait till they drive where it’s somewhere terribly inconvenient to pull over. And I’m gonna start screaming from the back like they do. “My buckle’s too tight!” [gasping] “I’m choking!” [gasping] [chuckles] “I dropped my wine.” [gasping] “I can’t reach my wine.” [chuckling] That’s what I want to do when I’m retired. I just want to drink red wine and watch House Hunters over and over. I love that show. I do. I don’t know why. I don’t even care what houses these people are buying. I’m more interested in their relationships because at least 50 percent of the people shouldn’t even be married, more or less purchasing property together. I saw one in Atlanta. It was a man and a woman. They walked into the house. And the first thing out of the man’s mouth, he goes, “Ah! I can’t live with this backsplash.” Oh, my God, ma’am. You have a much bigger problem than what house you’re gonna buy. You have accidentally married a gay guy. And his boyfriend is not gonna approve of this ugly backsplash when he comes over here while you’re at yoga, aka drinking with your girlfriends on a Thursday. I’m just amazed to, like– In my whole life I’ve never punched anybody, but if I was the Realtors on this show, I would punch at least half of these people– my own clients right in the face. They are so demanding, and they naysay a house right out of the gate. They just walk in and go, “Pah! I can’t live here. There’s no granite countertops.” I’m sorry. Maybe you forgot. You have a budget of $8.00. Maybe… you should be grateful that I’m not showing you a mobile home right now and bragging about the porch that JoJo put on before he went back to prison. What in Christ’s name would make you think you can have granite countertops? And it’s always the meanest lady of any episode who at some point would go, “I don’t know if I want to live here. I don’t see any room for entertaining.” Well, don’t worry, ma’am. No one’s fucking coming over here. You’re the meanest person I’ve ever heard speak English on television. Seriously. But I think over the age of 40, if that’s what I wanna do with my time– Over 40 you can kind of give up. If I just want to drink wine, why not? The dream catcher didn’t catch anything. It’s the third quarter. I’m losing. Just– I do understand– Over 40– I don’t understand young people that kind of give up so early where you can tell they’re just disgusted. They don’t want any more information. They have just had it. Early, like in their 20s. I flew to Norfolk, Virginia. I’ve never been there. I got off the plane. And their airport was themed. I’ve never seen that. And the theme they chose was mermaids. They were everywhere. They were, like, in the carpet, in baggage claim. They’re handing you the luggage. They’re just everywhere. And I went to the gift shop on the way out because I wanted to get water. There’s a girl working in the gift shop. She’s about 25 years old. I said, “Hey, I’m not from here. What’s going on with all this mermaid stuff?” And she said, and I quote, [raspy voice] “I don’t know. Somebody saw one once.” Wow. Wow. I thought, she truly doesn’t give a shit. She– Bigfoot could’ve been shopping in that gift shop. She’d be like, “I don’t know what your hairy ass is planning on buying, but I close in five minutes, all right? I ain’t scared of you, Mr. Monster Man.” “I don’t know. Somebody saw one once.” Just so disgusted that I even asked. But then after meeting the mermaid lady, for, like, the next three months no matter what question I was asked, that’s the only answer I would give. I’ll just go, “I don’t know. Somebody saw one once.” Because it is so confusing and dismissive to the recipient, but it’s so fun if you’re the one saying it. My– My youngest brother, the one who won’t let me speak about Malaysian Flight',\n",
              "  ' 370, he helps me with my taxes ’cause if I– Any state you work in you have to fill out their forms even if you don’t get money back. He called about six weeks after I’ve met the mermaid lady, and he goes, “Yeah, Kathleen, I’m trying to do your taxes. I’m trying to get all these states. I think you worked in Wisconsin two times. You should get– They have a state-withholding tax. You’ll be able to get a refund. It’s a 3.8 percent. Ah, da, da. When you got paid, you should’ve been given some forms. Do you know where those forms are?” “I don’t know. Somebody saw one once.” And I guarantee you, if you say that, the only thing a person will ever say back is, “What?” And then– [mouthing words] That’s what I wanna do. I wanna drink red wine and watch House Hunters . Uh, I don’t usually think I drink too much until you go to the doctor and they have those drinking questions on there. Yeah. Mine, it’s seven and eight. Question 7: Do you drink alcohol? A little tiny box says, “Yes.” Question 8: Do you drink two, four, six or eight drinks a week? “No.” [laughs] No. You are not even in the right ballpark. Jesus Christ. What is this, a Mormon practice? I thought the name said “Fitzgerald.” And I would not be judged on my deviant and abhorring drinking behavior. See other side, parenthesis, arrow. No. If I do feel bad about my drinking, I would come here. ’Cause you guys set a whole new bar. [audience cheering] Uh, or I go to Ireland. I try to go once a year to be with my people. To reset my priorities and my boundaries. I have friends that go to Hawaii every year. They’re like, “We love Hawaii, but you seem to really love Ireland. Do you think we would like it? Do you think they’re similar?” Oh. [scoffs] Well, they’re both an island. Um, Ireland, however, would have no vegetables or sun. I don’t know if those two things interest you, but they are fresh out. It is not a healthy place. That’s why I feel at home there, and that’s why I like it there. It’s sort of the gist. They just don’t really, truly give a shit. On a good level, in a healthy way, they’ve decided to not be healthy. I was in a pub. I ordered roast beef with mashed potatoes, ’cause I love that, and I thought, I’m going to ask, probably the answer is no, but I– The guy was like 80, the bartender. And I go, “Hey, do you guys, by any chance, have any corn?” You would’ve thought I asked for an eight-ball of cocaine. I– He goes, “Corn?” [Irish accent] “No, we wouldn’t have any corn here in the countryside. We probably don’t have any corn in the entire country at the moment.” I said, “Have you ever had corn?” “Yes. I’ve had corn. When I was nine, we traveled to Germany. And I had some corn and I didn’t care for it.” I was like, “Good for you.” He hasn’t had corn in 71 years. And he doesn’t give a shit. And he looks fine. And he’s bartending on a Thursday. The whole pace of Ireland is just slower. But I like it better. It just takes you a while in your American mind to slow down like that. I went– ’Cause they don’t– It’s very– Nobody’s really, you know, fired up on it. I went in a store that said “bagels,” in a little town in the country. I walked in. There’s a lady. And there’s a glass case, and there’s no bagels. And I thought, here we go. Right? I go, “You don’t have any–” I thought maybe they were in the back. “You don’t have any bagels?” “No, I’m afraid we wouldn’t have any bagels at the moment.” “Are you selling any other food right now?” “No. I wouldn’t be selling anything but the bagels, and I don’t have at the moment.” It’s at that point your American brain wants to go, “What the fuck is wrong with you people?” But I would never do that ’cause I’m Midwest polite. I– I said, “Uh, what– Can I ask you a question? Why are you still open? ’Cause you have nothing for sale.” She goes, “I left the door open. First of all, I don’t know where the bagels are. They’re supposed to b',\n",
              "  'e here half past 7:00. It’s half past 10:00. I don’t know. Perhaps there’s been an accident on the road. You’ll say a rosary or perhaps a novena tonight for Johnny the bagel man. I left the door open in case I had a nice conversation with someone like yourself.” Oh, my God. I have to now go back to the other bar and order a Guinness in order to fix this conversation in my brain. I love Guinness. That is actually my favorite thing in the whole world. It’s the greatest drink. It’s like somebody had a beer, and then somebody threw a roast beef in the beer, and then somebody put mashed potatoes on top and handed it to you. [man] Whoo! It’s not healthy. But I really don’t care about health either. There comes a point in your life where you’re like, “I think it’s too late.” That’s why I don’t like to watch CNN because Sanjay Gupta, that doctor, comes on, and he is a buzzkill. Every single time he’s on, he’s got bad news about things that can kill us. But it’s things we’ve been doing our whole lives. I’m like, “Sanjay, people watching CNN are most likely over the age of 30. It is too late for us. You, sir, should be on Nickelodeon. Tell the children. Save the children.” It’s too late. I was watching it about two weeks before Thanksgiving. He came on. He’s like, “Uh-oh. Oh, God. Horrible news. Uh, World Health Organization just did a study. And as it turns out, they have decided that processed meats are raising the cancer rates by a much higher rate, specifically bacon.” [audience jeering] Yeah. Yeah, well, that’s right, Wisconsin. That’s– [chuckles] Whoa. I’m like, bacon? I’m sorry to hear that, Sanjay. ’Cause I love bacon. I’ve been eating it my whole life. Sometimes I put it in Bloody Marys. I’ve actually drank bacon. That’s how much– I added it up. In my life, give or take ten, I have eaten 311 pigs. I– I’ve eaten a farm, sir. You can’t fix that with a yoga class. You can’t back that damage up with a walk around the block. And I don’t even go looking for health stuff. I’m not that person where– No. Like the front page of Yahoo. I don’t know. Six months ago it said, “If you’re fair skin with freckles, uh, click here.” Why, I don’t want to click it. You know it’s not good news. They’re not gonna go, “Hey, guess what, freckle people. Y’all won $50. Run on down to the post office and pick up your government check.” No. But I feel like I have to click on it, ’cause it’s a meeting of my people. What if there’s an announcement and I don’t hear it, and I’m the only lady that didn’t know. Look like some sort of jackass. So I clicked on it. Google this. It’s unbelievable. They go, “Uh-oh. Pah, just found this out.” Incoming. Breaking news. If you’re white with freckles, fair skin, and you’ve been drinking orange juice– All of us, our whole lives– or eating grapefruit, they have figured out that when you go outside in the sun, because your skin– It’s so easy to penetrate your skin, that the sun is activating the acid from the grapefruits and the oranges, raising your chances of melanoma by, like, 27 percent. Yeah. So now, I can’t go outside to exercise in the sunshine. Or I will become activated which forces me back into the dark bar… where I can have a Bloody Mary with some bacon in it. [applause] [man] yeah! And I said to my sister, “I would– I would exercise more. But all I do is fly around. I’m just sitting in an airport.” She goes, “You should get a Fitbit.” This is what this is on my arm. It would work better if I charged it properly. But this counts your steps and your miles. And it’ll have your heart rate if you want to enter your food. It’s like this– I go, “Well, maybe I’ll do that. Maybe I’ll get addicted to seeing how many steps I get in a day.” So, from my iPad, on my couch, I ordered the Fitbit from Amazon. I paid the extra money to have it overnighted. So the following day, this was on my porch on my front steps, which I n',\n",
              "  'ow know is six and a half steps away from my couch. And then I opened it up, and I googled it, ’cause I wanted to know how it work. Really? It can count how far I’ve walked, steps and speed. We can’t find Flight 370, but I’m not supposed to talk about that. Supposed to just let that go. But we have this technology. So I googled, “How does it work?” It works based on this motion from when you’re walking. And then, my Irish jackasses kicked in and I thought, but does it know if my whole body is moving? What if I had a glass of wine and I was going like that? Would it know? The answer is no. It does not know. I drank two and a half miles while watching the last– [applause] Thank you. Two and a half miles while watching the last Republican debate. I know I won’t vote for any politician who says this, uh, at anytime. If they say it. So far four of them have said it. It’s like a hack line they say on the campaign trail. I just find it so cheesy. They’ll go, “People, America is a place where your dreams can come true. I’m here to make your dreams come true. Wouldn’t you like your dreams to come true?” I’m sitting there thinking, “No. No, I don’t.” And the fact that you said that makes me certain you have never drank a box of wine and taken an Ambien. I do not want my dreams to come true. It was horrifying. I did it like six weeks ago. Here was the dream. This is the whole dream. I’m in Alaska, wearing a sombrero. It’s raining Cheetos, but I can’t move my arms. [groaning] Three and a half hours of that. No thanks. And then I turned on late-night TV, and that’s all the infomercials. And there it was, the Sarah McLachlan sad animal commercial. [audience groans] Exactly. I feel the same way. But I’ve seen it like 200 times. And do you know what I’ve done? Honestly? Nothing. And that’s not nice. But that’s the truth. I thought, why don’t I react to this? I can’t get an animal. I’m gone too much, but I could send the money. I think they say like 62 cents a day for the dog or the cat, right? But then I thought, “Well, I don’t know what’s going on there, Sarah, but that kid on the other channel is only 55 cents a day. So maybe your cat’s living a little large, Sarah. Or maybe the child needs a raise. I don’t know, but someone should check that before you start throwing figures like that out at night, late night when all the infomercials are on in a row.” And I thought, this ad doesn’t work on me because it’s so sad, I usually turn it off. Like, you can’t motivate people to action through the emotion of sadness. You need to make people angry or shocked or appalled. That’s what gets people of their ass. You don’t ever see a protest with a bunch of people just laying around crying. No. That’s not going to happen. And I thought, they need to redo this commercial to make a lot more money for the animals. I– This is what I’m doing late night after my Ambien and boxed wine. I’m thinking of how to fix the commercial. And I– I would call Sarah back. She seems like a lovely lady. Call her up in Canada and go, “We really messed up. We need you back down here, and we’re going to reshoot the commercial.” You pay for her to come back to America. You go, “Here’s what’s gonna– Here’s how it’s going to work, Sarah. We’re going to send you out to that song that you wrote, the saddest song ever written on earth.” ♪ In the arms ♪ [yowling] I don’t know what the words are. I think it’s about that cat having pink eye, but I can’t– I don’t know. That one definitely has pink eye. It’s dangerous ’cause it’s gonna hop to the other eye like Bob Costas at the Olympics. It’s– It’s a mess. You got to put hot water on it. And cats don’t like water. I don’t know how you would begin to fix that. But here’s what’s gonna happen, Sarah. You’re gonna walk out to that song that you wrote. Lovely song. And in one hand, you’re going to be holding a beagle puppy. And in the oth',\n",
              "  'er hand, you’re going to be holding a pistol. Remember, this is for the animals. Stay with me. And then I’m going to need you, Sarah, to say in your oh-so-angelic voice, without laughing– You have to be serious. She’ll go, “Hello. I’m Sarah McLachlan. If someone doesn’t come down here… in the next 45 minutes, I’m gonna blow this beagle’s brains out.” I would be horrified. I’d be like, “Can you Shazam her location? Where is she?” And I would drive down there, and I would take the puppy and kick the gun out of her hand. And where did you even get a gun? You’re Canadian. You’re allowed one bear gun per family, Sarah. That is not a bear gun. You guys have been a lot of fun. If you drank and you’re gonna drive, focus. Don’t be playing with your phone. I am not advocating drinking and driving. I’m not. Drinking and driving is really bad. And it’s really bad– I never thought about this. But I have a friend, who told me to say was a very handsome friend, Rick in Denver, he got a DUI. I never thought about this until he told me what happens. Now when you get taken to jail, they take all your stuff. That includes your phone. And they lock it all in a drawer. Then they come back to your cell and tell you you’re now allowed to make one phone call. [blows air] Well, that’s the problem. ’Cause you just locked my brain in a drawer. I don’t know anybody’s phone numbers by heart anymore. Seriously, I don’t. I don’t know what I– What– What would you do? I know the number of the house I grew up in. I could call that family… and hope that they were really nice people. “Don’t hang up. Don’t hang up. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. I’m in so much trouble. I know you guys are kind of busy in Ferguson. Do you have $2,800?” Then I thought, seriously? They wouldn’t let you look at your phone? He goes, “Kathleen, you don’t get it. No, no.” I go, “I think that’s being stringent. You’re not a murderer. You’re not a rapist. You’re Drunky the Clown. You’ve been captured. You can’t hurt anybody. They wouldn’t even show you your contacts?” “No.” I thought, especially if I had been drinking, that’s when my jackass behavior would kick in. And I would say, “Okay, I’m ready for my call.” I let them bring me the phone, and my one call, I would call 911 from the cell. [chuckling] “Hello. Oh, yes, this is absolutely an emergency.” [blows air] “Well, I have been kidnapped. That’s what’s going on here. I was abducted by two men in matching outfits. And I was thrown into what I can only surmise right now is some sort of sex dungeon.” [chuckling] “No, I’m not laughing. No, I’m not laughing. My location? Well, that actually is kind of funny. If– If you would just glance down the hall. Ha ha!” All right, you guys, thank you so much. I’ve had a great time. Thank you for coming out. We appreciate it. Lew too. Thank you. Good night.

              " ['Kevin James: Irregardless (2024) In Kevin James: Irregardless, a 2024 stand-up comedy special, Kevin James delivers a performance that expertly blends humor with insightful observations on everyday life. He begins with a quirky musical number, showcasing his singing talent and setting a lighthearted tone. Throughout the special, James touches on a variety of relatable topics, often with a self-deprecating twist. One central theme is the absurdity and humor found in aging and health. James jokes about his own physical decline and the overmedicalization of modern life, like being labeled “prediabetic” and the unnecessary fear this instills. He also satirizes societal overcaution with a story about a woman labeled “borderline anemic,” highlighting the tendency to exaggerate health concerns. James humorously addresses technology and its intrusiveness, particularly through his mistrust of Siri and the difficulty of deleting apps. His take on modern parenting and child-rearing resonates with many, as he discusses removing video games from his children and the challenges of engaging them in physical activities. This segues into a broader critique of contemporary parenting styles, contrasting them with the stricter, belt-driven discipline of previous generations. In a poignant turn, James reflects on his own limitations in knowledge and conversation, using the story of Buster Douglas to illustrate his narrow expertise. He humorously recounts an awkward social encounter where his lack of knowledge is exposed, leading to a comedic breakdown of his attempt to use complex vocabulary. In his routine, James humorously focuses on the dynamics of his marriage, particularly highlighting the contrast between his wife’s incessant talking and his own introspective nature. He examines their differing communication styles with a blend of admiration and playful frustration. The special concludes with a return to the musical theme, bookending the performance and leaving the audience with a feeling of entertainment mixed with thoughtful reflection on the absurdities of modern life. * * *  ♪ I’ve been having dreams About falling in love ♪ [audience cheering and whistling] ♪ It feels so real ♪ ♪ But nobody is here when I wake up ♪ ♪ Do you know my name ♪ ♪ The devil’s in the detail ♪ ♪ I’m a natural born killer ♪ [audience continues cheering] ♪ I’m a natural born ♪ ♪ Take this hopeless broken soul ♪ ♪ Of this remote control ♪ ♪ Plot twist ♪ ♪ A whole generation lost With no promise ♪ ♪ Can you feel my love ♪ ♪ Do you know my pain ♪ ♪ It’s in my head every night on replay ♪ ♪ A deadly game ♪ ♪ For a natural born killer ♪ ♪ I’m a natural born killer ♪ ♪ Natural born killer ♪ ♪ Okay, game face ♪ ♪ Go time, don’t play ♪ That was for you. That was my gift for you. Yeah. Gonna be honest, gave you a little too much. [audience laughing] I never go that long. That was little longer than I expected. I got a little excited. We’re gonna bring it down. ‘Cause everything hurts. Everything hurts. Last week I woke up, I asked my wife, “Hey.” “Did I play rugby yesterday?” [audience laughing] She’s like, “No, you shook a can of paint for me.” [audience laughing] She was right. This is all I did. This was it. Because it was outside of my every day body movements, I don’t do this. I felt it the day after. I’m gonna feel this tomorrow ’cause I just did this for you guys right now. It wasn’t even a big can. I’m talking the little Häagen-Dazs size. [audience laughing] Body’s falling apart. Falling apart. It’s horrible. When to the doctor to get checked out. H',\n",
              "  'e said, “Everything’s really good. I do wanna let you know that you are prediabetic.” I was like, “Hmm, all right?” [scoffs] Who isn’t, right? I mean, come on. [audience laughing] Why would you even tell me that? Do I have diabetes? He goes, “No.” [audience laughing] But I could get diabetes? He goes, “Yes.” Okay. Do you have diabetes? [audience laughing] He goes, “No.” I go, “But could you get diabetes?” [audience laughing] He said, “I guess so.” I go, “Let me tell you something, you’re prediabetic.” [audience laughing and clapping] No charge. That’s on the house. Are you alive? Yeah. You’re also pre-dead. Sorry about that. We’re all gonna die. Pre… Prediabetes. If I have diabetes, tell me. I’ll change the way I eat. What’s with the “pre”? That’s how this world operates. “Pre.” Fear. You might. Almost, you don’t know. Scan. Check. Pre-scan. What? Huh? Yeah. Everything’s fear. Did you hear about Julie? No, what’s the matter with Julie? She’s borderline anemic. [audience laughing] Julie has anemia? No. She’s borderline. She’s close. [audience laughing] So Julie’s anemic? No, she’s not anemic at all. Here’s the line if you would have anemia, you would be on this side of the line. And if you don’t have anemia, you’re on this side with everybody else. Julie is on this side with everybody else. She’s just slightly ahead of us all, closer to the line where she would have it if she did. But she doesn’t. She’s closer. She’s like in the whoa, you better watch out soon area, like maybe. [audience laughing] So, what do you want me to do? There’s nothing you can do. She doesn’t have it. [audience laughing] Then why are you telling me? I just thought you might want a little more anxiety added onto your plate with everything else that’s going on the world. [audience laughing] You know, just think about Julie, right? Prayers for Julie, you know what I’m saying? I mean, how does she do it? How does she wake up every day? To face another sunrise, trudging through the day, knowing that she almost has something that she doesn’t even have. [audience laughing] She’s so close to almost having something that, even if she did, it would be that bad. ‘Cause… She could clear it up with some red meat and a little B12. [audience laughing] She, she almost has it, man. [audience clapping] She’s there. She’s in trenches with this. She has two kids. What does she tell them? How do they grow up knowing that they have a mother that’s gonna be fine? [audience laughing] Everything is fear. It’s pre-fear. Fear. You don’t know. Fear. We have nothing to be afraid of. We have nothing to be afraid of. We really don’t. We… Yeah. Yes. [audience whoops] Nothing. We live in the safest times in all of human history. We have nothing to fear. We are so blessed. We are… You know who had something to be afraid of? Men fighting in the Revolutionary War. How about them? Or the Civil War, right? That’s fear. Right? Brother against brother. Across an open field. Chance of survival is minimal. And you’re the guy carrying the flag. [audience laughing] That’s fear. They’re handing out muskets… [audience laughing] …and you get the flag. [audience laughing] Yeah, I’d like a musket, please. Uh, sorry, we’re all out. I can give you the flag. [audience laughing] What do I do with that? Well, you see those line of guys over there, with muskets, across that field? You stand in front of them. You get right in front of them. And you give it a little of this. You just got… [audience laughing] You want me to raise our symbol, show the enemy exactly where to aim? That’s what the',\n",

B-E-A-G-R-G-I-G-F-E Aggressive! They didn’t care. [soft popping sounds] [audience laughing] [soft popping sounds] [soft popping sound] Aggressive. [soft popping sound] [soft popping sounds, grunting] I’d be waving that thing so low profile… [audience laughing] They’d be like, “Get that flag up! Let them know who we are!” [audience laughing] [audience cheering and clapping] I’d be like, “I don’t want the flag. Do you have a bayonet?” “No, I got a snare drum and drum sticks. You want that?” That’s even worse. [imitates drum roll] Fire that thing up! Let them know we’re coming! [imitates drum roll] [audience laughing] Play that thing! I’m playing it, I’m playing it. I’d take out the brushes if I could, right? [imitates brushing a drum] [audience laughing] We have nothing to be afraid of. We, we find things to be afraid of. We do. Food companies know we’re afraid. They know it. That’s why they’re trying to make all their food sound healthy. They market it that way. Have a box of Cheerios. My Cheerios says “may lower cholesterol” on the box. Cheerios may lower cholesterol. You know what I know about Cheerios when it says “may lower cholesterol” on the box? I know that Cheerios doesn’t lower cholesterol. [audience laughing] ‘Cause if it did, it would say “Cheerios lowers cholesterol”, but it says “may.” It says “may.” So they, either, honestly, they don’t know, or they had the laziest scientists in the history of the world working down at the Cheerio factory. Where they just come in every day, “Hey, Wendell, how’s it going? Just checking to see where we stand with the whole cholesterol thing.” Can we put that Cheerios lowers cholesterol on the box? Yeah, I wouldn’t. Yeah. I would just stick with “may.” [audience laughing] Just go with “may.” You haven’t figured it out? No, we’re trying to. We’re plugging away, but there’s a lot of stuff going on. I got a phone call earlier. I gotta take my daughter to soccer. There’s things getting involved here, you know. Just go with “may.” Put “may.” “May lower cholesterol.” They’re not gonna know. Put “may.” They’ll think it lowers. You don’t know. I don’t even know. So how are they gonna know? You don’t know that it couldn’t, right? Put that. Cheerios, you don’t know that it couldn’t lower cholesterol. [audience laughing] Put “definitely should lower cholesterol, Cheerios.” [audience laughing] I don’t trust anybody. I don’t trust the food companies. I don’t trust my phone. I don’t trust Siri. Do you trust Siri? Let me tell you, Siri is listening to you every second of the day. [audience laughing] I can’t stand that. You ever download an app? And it starts asking you questions, “Hey, do you mind if I share information with your other apps?” Yes, I mind. How do you even know him? What the hell is going on? [audience laughing] They’re all up to something, those apps. You know it. That’s their goal. They wanna stay on your phone as long as possible. That’s why it’s so hard to delete an app. You ever tried to delete an app? You gotta do that hard press on the phone, first of all. All the apps start shaking. [audience laughing and clapping] Oh, they know somebody’s going. They know this. [audience laughing] This is judgement day for one of them. Looking around, seeing what each other did. You know, thinking about who’s going. That’s why they make that little x so small. It’s small in the corner. ‘Cause you can’t get it with your',\n",

This guy is relentless.” They’re thinking about what they did. Oh, he’s definitely getting rid of me. It’s not you, it’s me. I haven’t learned Spanish in 30 days. [audience laughing] This idiot couldn’t learn Spanish if he was raised in Guatemala for 30 years. [audience laughing] It’s why it’s so hard dragging an app. You ever tried to drag an app from another page? It’s like, nope. [audience laughing] Nope. I like page five. [audience laughing] I don’t trust doctors. Do you trust doctors? I don’t trust doctors, no. [audience] No! They’re killing people who don’t need to die. I read this one story. This one woman, she was comatose. She was in the hospital. And she came back to life and started breathing again moments after her family pulled the plug. Is that a good story? [audience laughing] Yeah, I mean, she’s living. That’s good. She’s back to life. That’d make for some pretty uncomfortable conversation in that hospital room. [audience laughing] Right after, when she came back. Like, she, whoa! This is amazing! I can’t believe you all were here waiting for me. My family. I love you so much. What have you guys been up to? [audience laughing] Uh, nothing, Mom, nothing. You weren’t, uh, looking so good, Mom. Frankie, unplug your iPhone, you’re at 85%, unplug it. [audience laughing] How’re you feeling, Mom? How you feeling? I feel wonderful. My side hurts a little bit. Yeah, that’s ’cause we’ve already donated all your organs. [audience laughing] They’re coming at three for your eyes. We should get a family photo before they pluck the eyes. Let’s get a family photo. Mom, get in here. Before we’re looking at two black, empty sockets. Let’s go. [audience laughing] Only God pulls the plug on me. I tell my family all the time. Absolutely, yes. I don’t care. He created me. He can take me out whenever He wants. Is it a matter of money? So what? Have a garage sale. [audience laughing] So the kids don’t go to college? Who cares? Let’s be honest, they weren’t going anyway. [audience laughing] Keep the big man breathing. Do whatever you gotta do. I tell them all the time. I don’t care. At some point, there’s gonna be that woman that walks in the room. There’s always… You know what? Kevin would not want to live this way. You falcon-punch that witch right in the throat. [audience laughing] You just grab her and… Stomp her, right there. [audience cheering and clapping] Double strike her. How about you don’t wanna live. Who’s that lady killing people? Just walking in, “He would not wanna go on. He would not wanna do it. There’s no quality of life.” Hi-ya! [audience laughing] I had a close call too, about five years ago. I was, uh, driving home from a show and I hit a deer on the highway. It was pretty scary. It was a horrible experience, wrecked my truck. I was on the side of the road, pretty shaken up. Filling out the police report. She was asking me questions and the officer was like, “What happened? The deer just, uh, jumped out in front of you?” I was like, “What?” [audience laughing] She was like, “Did it just jump out in front of you?” [audience laughing] I was like, “No, no, it waved me over.” Um… [audience laughing] I was barreling down the road about 90 miles and hour and I was like, is that a deer calling over with its hoof? Sure enough, it was. [audience laughing] I pulled over to the side. I was like, “What’s up?” He’s like, “You’re doing like 90',\n",
              "  '.” And I’m like, “Okay, that’s my business. What do you care?” He’s like, “I know you got kids at home.” He knew my kids by name, which freaked me out. I’m like, I’m not gonna talk to this guy anymore. I don’t need this. I’m outta here. He’s like, “Hold up. Hold up. I’m sorry.” He said, “I’m sorry. Let’s started over. We’ll hug it out.” And I’m like, that’s pretty cool, a deer who’s about forgiveness. [audience laughing] I said okay, and go to hug him and he goes to hug me, and he goes, “What’s that?” and he points to my shirt. I go, “What’s what?” I look down, and he did that move in my face… [audience laughing] He goes, “I know where you live.” Then he ran into the woods. I got back in my truck and I started chasing him. But I couldn’t get through the thick trees, so I got out and camped out overnight. [audience laughing] And I waited. The next morning, I saw him. He was talking to a bunch of other deer. I army crawled over to him. And I put blueberries on my face all Rambo style. He didn’t even see me. I jumped on top of him. I sank my hooks in. I slit his throat and he bled out right there on the spot. Then I dragged him, like a mile. [audience laughing] Mile and a half, back to the highway and I threw him on the hood of my truck. [audience laughing] [audience cheering and clapping] And that’s when you showed up. [audience laughing] So, no, he did not just jump out in front of me. This was premeditated deer murder. [audience laughing] Can’t talk about my kids. I have four kids. Any parents? Lot of parents out there? [audience cheering] Yeah. Yeah. Trying to be a good dad, it’s, uh, it’s tough, man. It’s really hard. These, these times, it’s difficult, you know. I’m really having a tough time trying to motivate my kids. And, I don’t know, like, I don’t know, is it me or is it, like, all parents? I don’t know. Are your kids lethargic? [audience laughing] ‘Cause I got a slug farm at my house. I really… [audience laughing] My kids don’t even get dressed anymore. They just get up from bed with the blanket. They have a blanket on them. They light up their iPad, it illuminates their face, and they just shuffle, shuffle. Like some weird sand creature in a Star Wars movie. Past each other and past me. No one talks anymore. [audience laughing] My son’s the worst, always on the video games. I was like, “Hey, we can’t do this, man. Let’s get some activity, you know.” I went up to him and said, “Hey. Buddy. Listen, let’s, let’s grab a football and, uh, call all your friends. We’ll get on our bikes and we’ll ride over to the field. Grab some cones, we’ll set up outlines and touchdowns and all the stuff. We’ll, we’ll have a great, great game. Awesome game. Maybe two. We’ll wait there till the lights come on in the parking lot. We’ll play a night game as well. We’ll just have a blast. And he just looked over to me and said, “I’m good.” [audience laughing] That was it. My wife goes, “Just take the video games away from him.” That’s a great idea. And I did. We took our video games away from all our kids. All the video games were done. Take them away from your kids. Yes. Yeah, we did it. [audience cheering and clapping] You gotta do it. We have to do it. It helped. It was awesome right away. First of all, the girls, my daughters, their life got so much better immediately. They were seeing friends and reading. They didn’t even care. My son had a tough time. He did. Yeah, he was having… Especially, couple days in, he started getting all shifty-eyed and stuff, looking at me just… [audience laughing] Little shaky leg. He was lik',\n",
              "  'e an addict. He was really just kinda like… [audience laughing] I could tell he was having a tough time. He was… [audience laughing] [clears throat] Yo. Dad, yo, can I talk to you? Can I talk to your for a second? [audience laughing] Yo. C-Come over here, Brody. Let me talk to you for a second. Get away from Mom for just a second. [audience laughing] You gotta give me something to take the edge off. Give me a little something, a little brain tickler. Give me a little brain tickler. You got some Mario? [audience laughing] I was like, “No. No games, that’s it.” Okay, God bless you, sir. You have a good day. [audience laughing] You have a great day. God bless you, sir. I love you. God bless you. God loves you. You have a good day. Next day he came by, same thing. He’s a little manipulative too. You gotta watch out for him. I don’t know what he was trying to do. He was like, “Hey, how about this, Dad?” [clears throat] What if I got, like, a… an Oculus? I didn’t know what an Oculus is. Do you know? I didn’t even know. I had no idea. It’s the virtual reality, if you don’t know. The goggles. You put these big goggles on your face. And you’re in virtual reality. I was like, “Is it games?” He goes, “Yeah.” I’m like, “No, you can’t have it. That’s it, no games.” He goes, “But you don’t understand. These are active games.” I go, “What do you mean?” He goes, “Oh, it’s unbelievable. They have a boxing game where you can fight like Rocky or like, you know, Apollo Creed or Mohammad Ali. It’s, like, 12 rounds. And you have, like, hand weights. You’re boxing the whole time. You’re sweating like crazy. It’s amazing.” He goes, “There’s a dance cardio game where you’re, like, going crazy. Your heart rate goes through the roof. They also have a warrior game. There’s a warrior game, Dad, you wouldn’t believe it. You’re going through this village just wielding a sword. It’s like a crazy shoulder delt workout the whole time. Everybody’s doing it. All my friends, everybody is just working out like crazy. And here’s the best part, even if it’s raining outside or snowing, doesn’t matter. ‘Cause you get your workout in. It’s awesome.” [audience softly laughing] I was like, “I don’t know. I don’t know.” I started thinking about it. I’d rather you be outside doing stuff, but maybe this is a step in the right direction. So I said, “All right, let’s get the Oculus.” And I got him the Oculus. [audience whooping] Yeah. Wanna tell you how it went down. [audience laughing] First day, he gets the Oculus. I wake up, I go downstairs into the kitchen. He’s already got it on. He’s just standing there in the kitchen. Big, fat goggles on his face, just… [audience laughing] Zero movement. Zero movement. Just standing there. I’m watching him. He doesn’t know I’m there. I walk in. I’m like, “What is this?” This is the Oculus? This is it? And he’s just there. I watch and I’m getting a little upset, but then he starts to move and I go, “Here we go.” He backs up a little bit. I’m like, “Whoa.” He doesn’t even know I’m there. He reaches under. He feels under the kitchen counter. And he gets a stool. [audience laughing] And he sits down. [audience laughing] Now I’m really getting upset. ‘Cause… he doesn’t look like he’s fighting Apollo Creed. [audience laughing] I wanna give him the benefit of the doubt. I don’t know this virtual reality. I don’t know how far it goes back. Maybe his trainer’s stuck in traffic or something. [audience laughing] But he’s just sitting there now. Just sitting there, for another two minutes. I’m getting upset. I’m about to take them',\n",
              "  ' off and he steps up. I go, “Oh, here we go.” He takes one step and levels up. He’s just standing there. I’m like, “Oh. Here we go.” He goes like this. I’m like, “All right.” Then he goes like this. Then he goes like this. I go, “Here we go.” Then he goes like this. Then he goes like this. I’m like, “Yes, he’s warming up. Look at this.” Then he goes like this. Then he goes like this. Then he goes like this. [audience laughing] And then he goes back to his perch. He just goes back. [audience laughing] I’m furious. I’m furious. But then he goes like this. He leans like this and then he goes like this. Then he goes like this. He starts going like this. [audience laughing] I’ve no idea what… No idea. Just this. I’ve had enough. I rip the goggles off his head. He’s like, “Oh, no!” Which I’m told you’re not supposed to do. It’s like waking a sleepwalker, you’re not supposed to do that. I put them on. I wanted to see what he was doing. You know what? He was playing a game. You know what game it was? Job Simulator. [audience laughing] He was working part time at a convenience store. [audience cheering and clapping] He was waiting for customers to come in his store. He was just sitting there. [audience laughing] He wasn’t active at all. He wasn’t sweeping up in between customers. Stacking cases of beer in the back. He was sitting there. He was sitting there and then, finally, a customer came in and he stepped up, leveled up, got him a pack of cigarettes or something. Rang him up, I saw the cash register was right there. Gave him the change. Nodded. He’s a polite kid. At least he’s got that going for him. Then he goes back to his chair. And I’m like, “What was this? What was this and all that?” You know what it was? He was scratching off his own lotto tickets. [audience laughing] He’s not even a good fake employee. [audience laughing] I just said, “You’re punished. That’s what it is. That’s what’s up.” I don’t know how to punish our kids anymore. I don’t even know what we can do, what we can’t do. I don’t even know what… I know our parents, our dads, they knew how to punish. Back in the day, they knew how to punish. They did. They had it exactly correct. Every… The punishment always fit the crime perfectly. Because they got the belt, that’s why. [audience laughing] Yes. You only had to get the belt once. You got the belt once, you never did whatever you were doing ever again. Then your dad just had to show you the belt. And that was enough. You remember that? Hey, what did you say? [audience laughing] Yeah, okay, I’m good. Yeah. [audience clapping] Yes. Belt worked. Remember how out of nowhere that first time you got the belt was? You were popping off at your mom, You go like, “Hey. Mom, I’m not having your meatloaf tonight. It’s horrible. I’m not having it. It’s very dry. Who puts peas in meatloaf? I can’t do it. I can’t. It’s way too dry. Look up the recipe, Betty Crocker. Check it out, woman. Why is Dad getting undressed? What’s going on? What are you doing? [audience laughing] “No, add ketchup to it, I don’t care. Some sauce, get it going. It’s just horrible. It’s very dry. What’s up, Dad? Are you a lion tamer? What is this? What’s this snap, snap? Snap, snap. I don’t know… Oh, my God! Oh, God!” [audience laughing] And it worked. The belt’s worked since 25 BC. It’s worked throughout history. All the way up until, like, 1993 when some frail d-bag introduced the first time out. [audience cheering and clapping] And that’s when we lost society, right there. When everything burns and civilization comes to an end, we can ',\n",
              "  'trace it all the way back to that one guy. That’s the guy. Time out. It changed the game. Time out? How can you do that? Can you imagine trying to convince your dad to give you a time out back in the day? Hey, Dad, listen up. Very sorry about stealing your car last night, taking it for a joy ride. Doing donuts in that parking lot and wiping out that whole store front, but how’s about this? [audience laughing] Instead of you whipping this ass with that leather strap and that massive belt buckle you got in New Orleans… [audience laughing] I’m thinking I’m gonna wander off over into the corner for a little bit. [audience laughing] Maybe think about where I went wrong, maybe not. I don’t even know. I don’t know what I’m gonna do. I might sing a song, I might hum one. It doesn’t matter. Important thing is, it’s my time, it’s my time over in that corner. And when I feel good enough, and I feel like I’m ready to inject myself back into society, I will come back here and I will tell you and we’ll see how that goes. How do you feel about that, cowboy? How’s that? [audience cheering and clapping] Why are you getting undressed again? What’s going on? [audience laughing] Time out. They don’t even do time outs anymore. Now time outs are too cruel. They’ve become too cruel. Time outs. Oh, the ch… No, you can’t. What? You can’t do a time out. It’s too cruel for the child. They’re alone. They’re isolated. They’re in the corner of the room. By themselves. There are other people. They’re just… No, they’re way… It’s in a corner. They’re looking at two walls meeting. It’s, it’s too much for the child to deal with. You can’t isolate them like that. Any… You can’t. You just can’t isolate them. They don’t even do that anymore. They don’t do time outs anymore ’cause it’s too much. They do what’s called a time in. It’s called a time in. I’m serious. What they do is the dad will take the child, you sit in the middle of the room, they put the child next to them, they stroke their shoulder and… You both kinda go over what went wrong and kinda where… the child went off the tracks. And… Once you start making them feel good about being bad… [audience laughing] Probably after, like, seven or eight minutes, you just let them go. Then you stay there for, like, an additional four minutes. [audience laughing] Just to think about what a loser of a parent you’ve become. [audience cheering and clapping] We’re raising baby veal. That’s what we’re doing. We are. We are. We are. We’re so easy on our kids. And so what? It doesn’t help them. I love my kids. We all love our kids. We know that. But you know what? They all can’t be the best. They can’t. Not right away, anyway. This is what we tell them, constantly. You’re the best. You are the best. You are so good. You are the best. You’re the best. Isn’t he the best? Yeah. He’s the best. You’re the best. He’s the best. You’re so good. You’re the best. [loud sigh] No, you suck. [audience laughing] You’re not… What are you the best at? We wanna get you to be the best, but you can’t do anything right now. What can you do? Can you match your socks? Can you do a back flip? Can you black tar a driveway? Can you roll a cigar? Can you drive a forklift? Can you put your toothbrush back in the cup when you’re done using it? [audience laughing and clapping] Nothing. Without me, you can do nothing. If I dropped you off in the woods you wouldn’t last ten minutes before you were eaten by coyotes. [audience laughing] Kids suck. They suck. [audience laughing] They’re not good. They’re not good. That should, that’s the d',\n",
              "  'efinition of a kid. “You suck.” That’s what they should be called. How many you-sucks do you have? I’ve got one and two on the way. [audience laughing] Twin you-sucks? That’s amazing. Congratulations. Thank you. [audience laughing] Your kids suck. My kids suck. I’m sorry to break it to you. There’s one kid I saw on the internet. One kid. This four-year-old Korean boy. He was playing Mozart on an accordion. He had something special, nobody else. [audience laughing] But 100% he got the belt. Oh, he definitely got the belt. Oh, he was Mozarting his ass off. He was like… [audience laughing] That’s how you get good. [audience laughing] My son wanted to play Little League. So I called the coach. I said, “Listen, my boy wants to play. Is it okay if he joins the team?” He’s like, “Yeah, we didn’t even start practicing yet. We practice Thursday night.” I said, “That’s wonderful. It’s awesome. And, uh, I’ll bring him down.” He says, “Yeah, I just wanna let you know that we don’t keep score in this league.” [audience laughing softly] I say, “Why? Why not?” He’s like, “We don’t wanna upset… the parents and disappoint any of the kids, so we don’t keep score.” I was like, “Why even have them bat?” Why not just have them walk up to the plate, “Hi, how’re you doing?” [audience laughing] Could you put me down for a double? [audience laughing] Yeah, my mother says I preregistered for a double. I got a double. Thank you. I got a double, Mother! [audience laughing] A double. I got a double. Every kid gets a trophy. You know how I found out? There was a $40 charge on my bill. I was like… [audience laughing] What’s this right here? He like, “That’s for trophies.” We didn’t even have a practice yet. He’s like, “Congratulations, you guys won. You guys are champions.” [audience laughing] I’m like, “Who?” He’s like, “Everyone.” Everyone? Me? He goes, “Yeah. Did you drive him here?” I go, “Yes.” He goes, “Congratulations, you’re a winner.” [audience laughing] I played Little League in the 1970s. Played for five years. Got a trophy once. One year. That’s it. One trophy. You know why? ‘Cause we won. That’s it. [audience cheering and clapping] You know how I know? ‘Cause we kept score. [audience laughing] You know why we did that? ‘Cause that’s how baseball’s played. The team with the larger number, the more runs, they’re the winners. And the losers are the team with the less numbers. They’re the losers and they go home as a team and they try to come back and do better. And sometimes that drive actually helps them. That’s actually the better choice, to lose and try to come back, because it’s human nature. Human nature. [audience cheering] It’s good for them. One trophy. That’s all I had. I would go in my room and see that one trophy. I’d be like, “Oh, yeah. That’s the year we won.” That’s it. The one time. That was worth it. It was great. I went to my neighbor’s house. His living room is littered with trophies. I know his kids. I’m like, “This is criminal.” [audience laughing] I’m like, “What’s this one for?” Oh, that’s when Warren was gonna try out for photography club. [audience laughing] But he got a cold and missed the season. It says “MVP.” Yes, we’re very proud of him. [audience laughing softly] They’re so fortunate, kids today. They have the greatest fields, I see them, I see them here. The pristine sod and the outfield walls. With the sponsors and the, and the lights for night games. Kidding me? I played in the 70s and they had none of that. You pull up to, like, a parking lot with cement and clumps of grass and broken Schmidt’s bo',\n",
              "  'ttles everywhere. Just… Is this field two? Yeah, this is field two. This is us. Your coach would pull up in a 1971 Impala, pop the trunk to hand out uniforms. [imitates trunk squeaking open] Had everything in that trunk. Clearly thrown out of his house ten minutes ago by his wife. [audience laughing] Smoking right in front of us. [audience laughing] Gather round, guys, gather round, team. Get around me. Make a circle. Listen to me, if it’s a hit to right field… shortstop got it covered. Second base… don’t overthrow the cutoff man, okay. You’re overthrowing the… Like a nicotine oscillating fan right in our faces. [audience laughing] No parents running over, “Hey, Phil, maybe you shouldn’t smoke in front of the kids.” You kidding me? They’re setting up snack tables, playing dominoes, drinking vodka, about 30 yards that way. [audience cheering and clapping] They’re just so happy the weird guy in the polyester pants and bushy mustache is looking after them for a while. Right in my face. Benson and Hedges. It stung right in the retinas. Stinging me like crazy. Smoke billowing down my body. But you know what? No allergies today. [audience cheering and clapping] Nada. I eat whatever I want. I can see a raccoon walking around midday. Just rip it’s face off, clumps of hair missing, doesn’t matter. I can just eat that thing whole and be fine an hour later. [audience laughing] You know why? ‘Cause I drank water out of a hose that was rolled up in my backyard. [audience cheering and clapping] That sat outside in the grass in the hot sun for months at a time, melting that plastic. It boiled up so much it would burn your face. It wouldn’t even come out in a steady stream. You’d be p-p-p-p-p… [audience laughing] Firing rusty spickets through that thing like BBs into the back of your throat until it wasn’t enough and you just ripped the hose off the faucet and wrapped your lips around that. [audience laughing] Just suck all the asbestos and lead right out of the house. Just… [audience laughing] Go right to the source and I was fine. Why was I fine? ‘Cause all day long at school I’m chewing on pencils. [audience laughing] I’m sniffing magic markers like they’re going out of style. Thirty seconds a nostril. Have some fun. Get used to it. Eating paste ’cause it looked like mayonnaise. [audience laughing] Or Play-Doh. How good did Play-Doh smell? Smelled amazing. You try it, like, whoa, different story. [audience laughing] Next day, you try it again. Different color. You’re like, “Maybe this is fruit flavored. Try.” [audience laughing softly] We had allergies and things back in the day. We just didn’t label everything. I’m sure I had anxiety. I know I did. I was a pitcher. I was eight years old. I remember this. I had a really strong arm. I was on the mound. I was firing the ball, aiming it, and I was missing the plate. I started walking batters and it was getting to me. I loaded up the bases and I was breathing heavy. I felt it. I felt this heaviness. And it was bothering me. I started trying harder and I was walking more batters. I started walking runs in. I’m looking at my friends in the field and they were looking at me and I felt terrible. I remember this. ‘Cause I remember my dad, who was also a coach, he walked out to the mound and he gave me the greatest advice I’ve ever received in my entire life. He literally walked up to the mound, he put both hands on my shoulder, looked me dead in the eyes and says, “Hey. Stop aiming the ball. You know what to do.” He said two words. “Just throw.” That’s all he said. “Just throw.” He',\n",
              "  ' turned around and he walked back to the dugout. And I remember it’s the greatest advice I’ve ever received in my entire life. Think about it. Anytime life has got you down, there are obstacles you gotta overcome. Just throw. That’s all you gotta do. Just throw. Yes. Believe in yourself. [audience cheering and clapping] Trust yourself. And just throw. And that’s what I did. I launched back into my windup and I just threw. And I shattered the kid’s cheekbone. I remember… [audience laughing and clapping] Ball bounced like 30 yards, two more runs scored. So my Dad was wrong there. You gotta aim the ball. [audience laughing] In baseball. That’s the… That’s like where… That’s the worst advice ever. To just, just throw it in baseball. Then you’re just running around, just throwing at everything. You can’t. You gotta… [audience laughing] Doesn’t work in baseball. But anywhere else in life, it’s great advice. Great advise. Just throw. Just do it. He was smart. My dad was a smart man. Never went to college. Didn’t have to. Didn’t know all subjects, but he knew subjects in depth. He had depth to the subject. That was it. He knew it. He knew it well. I don’t have that. I don’t know, my Dad was handing me the, uh, knowledge baton. He was literally like, “Here it is. From generation to generation. This is all the wisdom and intelligence of our family. And I’m giving it to you, my son.” And I was like… I’m good. [audience laughing] I don’t feel like reading that thing right now. I paid for it. ‘Cause he could answer any question I ever had. And I know nothing now. As an adult, I’m faking it. That’s why I hate having conversations. ‘Cause I don’t know enough. I know things, but I don’t have any in-depth knowledge. I can’t go deep. Still water does not go deep. That’s why, anybody talks to me, it’s literally like they say something and I have zero point of view. I can’t add anything to it. I’m just like, oh, oh, yeah, yeah. [audience laughing] One subject, one subject I know a lot about. Buster Douglas. Remember him? Remember the heavy-weight champ who upset Mike Tyson back in 1990? At the Tokyo Dome. Forty-two to one odds. Mike Tyson was 37-and-0 at the time. 55,000 people there. I know all this. You know why I know it? Because ESPN had a 30 for 30 on it and I recorded it and watched it, like, 12 times. So I have all this information about Buster Douglas. Here’s the thing. Hardly ever comes up in conversation. [audience laughing] That’s how dumb I was. I put all my eggs in the Buster Douglas basket. [audience laughing] And my wife, this was the worst. We got invited to this local municipal government fundraising dinner. It was, like, every word I hated in there. Except dinner. I was fine with that. [audience laughing] Hope you said no. She was like, “I accepted.” Why would you do that? I don’t wanna talk to anybody. I can’t. I don’t know anything about government. They’re gonna make me look like an idiot. I don’t wanna do it. She’s like, “Relax.” She’s good at talking. She’s like, “I’ll go with you. I’ll be there the whole time. I promise you, we’ll mingle around, we’ll have some hors d’oeuvres, we’ll have a little dinner, and then we’ll leave. And I’ll stay with you the whole time.” You promise? She’s like, “Yes.” As soon as we get there she goes, “I’ll be right back. I have to go the bathroom.” And she takes off. [audience laughing] Some guy walks over to me. He says, “Hey.” I’m like, “Oh, gosh, here we go. Hey!” How about this whole Figueroa thing as councilman? Tell you one thing, he ain’t gonna last, huh? [audience laug',\n",
              "  'hing] Let’s break it down, shall we? First, don’t know who Figueroa is. Don’t know… You know what a councilman is? Do have any idea? He could’ve said carrot-maker. It wouldn’t have made a difference. I’ve no idea what a councilman is. [audience laughing] How do I answer? I wanna look like I know, so I go, “Really?” Like I’m concerned for Figueroa. He goes, “Yeah, really.” I go, “Why?” He goes, “I’ll give you one reason why. Treason.” I was like, “Treason? You gotta be kidding me.” In my head, I’m going, you don’t even know what treason means. [audience laughing] You don’t know the definition of treason. I don’t know… Did you ever break away from a conversation mentally to try to figure out a word that somebody just launched at you? You’re in your head, going, break it down. Treason. What does it mean? Treason. Well, tree is in the front, reason is in the back. Trees… are reasonable. Maybe he’s talking about the environment. Get in there and talk about the environment. So I go back to talk to him and he’s just staring at me. So I don’t know how long I was out for, you know. I don’t know if he asked me a question or not. He’s just staring at me. I’m starting to sweat, ’cause I don’t know what to say. I’m feeling uncomfortable. And he doesn’t say… So I go to my fallback, which is this. It’s great. I just go, “Yeah, it’s all crazy anyway. What are you gonna do, right? He’s supposed to say, “Yeah, it’s nuts. Anyway, you have a good night.” You too. But he doesn’t. He goes, “What’s crazy?” I go, “I don’t know. No one’s ever answered my question with a question before.” [audience laughing] Just the whole thing. He’s like, “What whole thing?” How it all went down. He’s like, “What went down?” Motherf… Just leave me alone! [audience laughing] He was trying to expose my stupidity. He wouldn’t stop. He was not letting me go. He was chasing me, like I was an opossum running behind a dumpster and he had a flashlight in my face. What did you say? No, you’re dumb. What did you say? You’re very dumb. You don’t know who Figueroa is. Who is Figueroa? No, you don’t. Who is Figueroa? Who is Figueroa? Who is he? You don’t… Name the three branches of government. [audience laughing] I’ll spot you Legislative. [audience cheering and clapping] I should just be honest with people. I should just walk up, “Hi, my name’s Kevin. I got about a fourth grade vocabulary.” [audience laughing] I’m gonna get lost pretty quickly into the conversation, but I’ll stay here and I’ll nod my head and I’ll smile, make you feel better about yourself, but don’t be fooled, I am dead behind the eyes. [audience laughing and clapping] I don’t do that. I try to match. I try to match. I throw in big words I don’t even know. What do you think the problem with society is? I go, “I gotta be honest. I harken…” Har… Harken. [audience laughing] I’ve never said “harken” before in my life. Harken? What am I? Winston Churchill? Where… It behooves me to think that… my monocle and my, mm, pocket watch, ha-ha, burlap brown pants, working on the cobble stone in London, fatty, fatty, fatty pants. Fatty pants. Walking in London rain. Who am I? Mm, pipe. Who am I? Harken. Or I answer too quickly. What do you think the problem with the culture is? I’m like, “I know what it is.” I know what it is? [audience laughing] I go, “I think it’s a lack of conscious.” Conte-ness. Consci-ness. He’s like, “What?” You ever not even be sure of the tense of a word? C… It’s a lack of con… conscience-ness. [audience laughing] I’m sorry, what did you say? C-Con… It’s a lack of consciention… [audie',\n",
              "  'nce laughing] It’s a lack of con… uncon… I think unconscien… unconscientuously. I think uncon… con… Conscience… Conchi… It’s a lack of conch… Of we’re not uncontentience. [audience laughing] You’re gonna have a society… S-so… So-socotal… Socielitally… You’re gonna get a tyranny. A tyr… A tyran… An tyrannical-saurus rex is gonna come back. [audience laughing] And the dinosaurs are here. That’s what I’m saying. I’m sorry, I’m not following you. I went… [scoffs] Irregardless of that, I gotta tell you… I said it. [audience laughing and clapping] Oh, he stopped me, “That’s not even a word.” I beg to differ. He’s like, “I’m sorry, you’re not making any sense.” [audience laughing softly] You know what else didn’t make sense? When Buster Douglas upset Mike Tyson back in 1990. [audience cheering and clapping] At the Tokyo Dome. 55,000 people. Forty-two to one odds. You have a good night, sir. Have a good night, sir. [audience clapping] That’s when my wife walked out of the bathroom. What did I miss? Anything good? Ha-ha. Okay. All right. My wife’s awesome. I love her so much. She… We’re an amazing fit because she loves to talk. She’s like the balance to me. She’s so good at it. She can talk to people. She knows what questions to ask. She just loves it. I remember, that night we got in the car to drive home. She just started talking again. I was like, “Hey. You know, we don’t need it now. We…” [audience laughing] We don’t need to talk ever again. [audience laughing] We don’t. That’s a good thing. We’ve been together, like, 20 years. I’ve already said every word I’m ever gonna say to her in every combination. That’s it. And she said every word to me. She knows everything about me. I know everything about her. We don’t need to talk anymore. We can finish out the rest of our life with gestures. That’s it. [audience laughing] Not her. She loves to talk. She loves it. She’s just one of those people. She just loves it. Loves the sound of her internal voice. She’s like, “Uh…” Loves the vibration of her lips on her teeth or something. The whole nine yards. Whatever’s involved with talking, she… [makes noises] Ever hear a baby whenever they find their voice? They’re ma-ma-ma-ma. Brr… Brr… Brr… La-la. Brr… She just goes. I don’t think she’s ever had an unexpressed thought in her life. [audience laughing] No. Everything she sees, it goes right in, and she has to say it. She just, “Oh, my gosh, this door’s so squeaky. That picture’s crooked, I can’t believe that. We’re gonna make eggplant for Thursday. We’ll have some friends over. Would that be good? Look at my reflection in the mirror. I see two of me. Do you see two of me? It’s really weird. I can’t believe the kids are standing on hardwood floor now, look at that. The lights are good. The holidays are coming. This is fun.” Hey, sit one out. Sit one out. [audience laughing] I have thoughts in my head all day long. Weird ones. How many tater tots can I fit in my mouth without dropping any? [audience laughing] It’s in there, but I keep it in the barn. I keep it in there. Not my wife. She doesn’t have any barn doors. It’s just free-range thoughts. I see it. I say it. I see it in the senses and I say it. Look at those exit signs. The light. The floor. Everything is… I see it. I say it. I see it. I say it. It’s like a verbal wood chipper. [imitates chipper whirring] [audience laughing] I see it. I say it. I gotta say it when I see it. I see it. I say it. I gotta say it. [imitates chipper whirring] [audience laughing] Hey. There’s an ebb and flow to conversations. There is. Fifty perc',\n",
              "  'ent is listening. It’s like double Dutch. You gotta wait for your turn. [audience laughing] Not her. She’s in there the whole time. Like… I got this. This is my talk. This is my talk. Back it off. Can someone else talk? Get outta here, [unclear], this is me. Big Mac, Fillet-o-Fish, Quarter Pounder, French Fries, I see Coke, milkshake, sundaes, and apple pie. [audience cheering and clapping] You wanna talk? Talk. Go in your closet, take your clothes off, and talk all night long. But why do I have to be there? [audience laughing] It’s this emotional backboard. She doesn’t care what I think or say. She wants me there. Why? Talk. Go. I always gotta be there, though. I’m literally brushing my teeth. Getting ready for bed. And I hear it. [audience laughing] Telling me things. That I experienced with her. I was with her all day. [audience laughing] Can’t believe Alan stood up in front of everybody revealing facts about his son. I didn’t like that at all. I couldn’t believe it. Could you believe it? In my head, I’m going, “Yes, I can. You know why? ‘Cause I was there.” [audience laughing] This was your point of view. [audience laughing] This was mine. I was there. I experienced everything with you! Na-na-na-na-na… Talking herself to sleep. Literally talking herself through sleep. You know how much you wanna go to sleep and you’re tired? And she’s still fighting it. [mumbling] [exhale, mumbling] [mumbling] Finally. It goes quiet. Sweet quiet. You go to bed. Next morning I wake up. [audience laughing softly] I’m brushing my teeth. And it starts up again in the other room. [audience laughing] I’m like, “What new knowledge did you pick up…” [audience laughing] “…overnight?” What did you get? What could you have picked up? Nothing new happened. [audience laughing softly] But she wants me there. She wants me in that conversation. Again, doesn’t care about what I have to say. Does… doesn’t matter. She wants me there. And she tries to get me snagged into these conversations. She’ll like lob out half sentences to me. That’s what she’ll do. She’ll lob them out like she fly fishing to try to catch me. [loud sigh] I sure hope Ellen’s gonna be okay. [audience laughing] I usually let the first one just pass by. [audience laughing] ‘Cause if enough time passes, I can just kinda… [mumbles] [audience laughing] But there’s always a follow-up. Sure hope they can work through this. Okay, we gotta engage. [audience laughing] I’m thinking, “What’s our plan?” Our plan is, we wanna get outta here as quickly as possible. We have so much stuff to do. But we can’t try to shorten the conversation. We know that, ’cause she’ll sense that. She’s good at that. And then she’ll tack on 45 minutes just out of spite, so… [audience laughing softly] What if I steer into it? What if I go in the other way? It’s dangerous, but it’s… Risky move, but it could pay off. Let’s just go into it and I did it. Hey, honey. Yeah. Let’s do it. Let’s do what? Let’s just talk about Helen all morning long. [audience laughing] Let’s just do it. We’ll grab a couple of beanbag chairs. Put on a pot of coffee. We’ll sit down. You tell me everything about Helen from conception to this morning. [audience laughing] Let’s do it. Let’s just get knee-deep in Helen. What do you say? Okay, first of all, it’s Ellen. It’s not Helen. There’s no H, okay? [audience laughing] She’s my friend from Pilates who you don’t know. She’s going through some stuff right now. But let’s do it. Let’s just do it anyway. I don’t care. I wanna learn about her. And I wanna be here to learn about her, with yo',\n",
              "  'u. What do you say? [loud exhale] [audience laughing] No. I promised her I wouldn’t say anything to anybody. [audience laughing] Okay. I really wanted to be here for you. I love you. I just wanted to let you know that. I’ll see you later, okay. [audience cheering and clapping] There’s always a follow-up. All right, I’ll tell you. But you gotta promise me you’re not gonna tell anybody else. Promise you? I can’t do that. What if I’m playing softball with the guys? And we’re warming up and I’m throwing with my buddy and he’s like, “Hey, anything going on with your wife’s friends at Pilates that I should know about?” [audience laughing] I can’t believe you brought that up. Yes. Guys, bring it in. Everybody, bring it in, both teams. Come out of the dugout. Everybody, take a knee. I wanna tell you about my wife’s friend Ellen or Helen, who I don’t know, from Pilates. [audience laughing] She’s going through some stuff right now. No, hands down, I’ll answer questions afterwards. [audience laughing] You gotta promise me you’re not gonna tell anybody. How about I promise you I’m not listening to a word you’re saying as you’re saying it? How about none of your words are actually reaching my ears? Nothing. Nothing. They’re exploding in the atmosphere before they reach me like a fourth of July party, like… [soft popping sounds] I can’t believe… [popping sounds] I can’t believe she named… [popping sounds] And I told her her coworkers… [popping sounds] I’m getting none of this. [popping sounds] I’m getting none of it. [popping sounds] I didn’t even know you were taking Pilates. [popping sounds] [audience laughing] Just gotta beat her at her own game. That’s all you gotta do. Fourteen. What? Fourteen. What? That’s how many tater tots I think I can fit my mouth without dropping any. You guys are the greatest!

              " ['[Announcer] Ladies and gentlemen, Larry, The Cable Guy! [crowd cheer and applaud] All right. Thank you. Please remain seated. Do not rush the stage. Thank you. Well, this is awesome.! Who cancelled? Thank you so much… for having me. This is a good-looking crowd. I’ll tell you what. Right now, Cracker Barrel’s wondering where all the regulars are, right? Look at this. This is good-looking! Well, good to be in Joliet! That’s right. [crowd cheer and applaud] I bet that’s the first time you ever heard that. [all laughing] I’m only kidding. Hey, I’m glad– Hey, look, I gave up a colonoscopy to be here, all right? So… This is a big deal for me, too, so thank you for coming. Daggum good-looking folks in Illinois. I’ll tell you that much. I love you, which begs the question, “What state are you from?” [all laughing] I’m only serious. All right, anyway. No, I’ll see you at the house. God bless you. Thank you. We’re gonna have fun tonight, I tell you. I’d done a show last night, and the folks that didn’t walk out on me really enjoyed it, so, uh… I always like to picture everybody naked when I first come out. You know, I’m not nervous or nothing. I’m just a pervert, so… [all laughing] Daggum, you need to put your clothes back on right here. -Aah, what is that? [crowd laughing] [chuckles] You should picture me without clothes on. Then you’d be laughing so hard, I wouldn’t have to tell any jokes up here. Sorry about my outfit. I just come from a wedding, so I apologize for that, but… It was a weird wedding, too. They had the father-daughter dance. They ended up leaving together. [all laughing] All right, one more joke like that, I’m getting the hell out of here, all right, ’cause th-that’s uncalled for, right there. I guess I should do this. Git-R-Done! [all cheering] That’s right, Git-R-Done! You know, the first phrase– That wasn’t my original phrase. The first one I’d come up with was “Yipper-dipper-ripper-scripper!” [crowd chuckles] I know, right? It wouldn’t fit on a hat, plus, I don’t know what the hell it means! All right? No idea. I was going to, uh, work out, this morning, but, I, uh– I woke up with a sweat, so I figured I already had done there, so, uh… [crowd laughing] Almost didn’t make it here tonight. Uh… I hate flying in airplanes. I had to fly to meet my bus, and I hate flying them daggum airplanes, and the daggum airport wouldn’t let me bring my emotional support stripper with me on the airplane. [all laughing] I ain’t kidding. When that plane gets a-goin’ like that, if I can’t motorboat a pair of titties, I’m in trouble. [all laughing] All right? It was so windy where I live one time, I lost my hat, two cigars, and my neighbor’s house. Lost his house, ’cause one of my cigars blowed in his trailer and burned his house down, all right? So let’s keep that to ourselves. It got out of control, too, it burnt down Cheryl’s she-shed. [all laughing] All right? That’s right. Now you know the whole story right there. You know the whole story. Tonight’s a special night for me. Tonight is the 10-year anniversary when my hometown gave me the keys to the city and had a little parade for me. -So, uh, thank you so much. [applause] Thank you. Remain seated. Thank you. And tomorrow is the 10-year anniversary, again, when they, uh, changed all the locks in the city, all right? Well, it’s cold wintertime again. Do you like the winter? [crowd moaning] I hate it. I like summer better than winter. That winter kills me. My weenie’s been an innie for the last five days in here. Can’t– I ain’t kiddin’. I could flash a cop and not get in any trouble right now. It snowed the other day. I can only pee my initials in the snow, all right? But my upper body loves cold weather. My lower body can’t handle it. I wish they’d get together on the weather. It gets cold out… [clicks tongue] You coul',\n",
              "  'd play “This Little Piggy” on my daggum nipples. He hates you, but they love– These little piggies went to market! Yeah, well, that little hog stayed home, all right? I guarantee you that. It’s cold everywhere. I was in Los Angeles, California. It’s so cold, I’d seen a junkie with his tongue stuck to the spoon, all right? My wife’s from Wisconsin. You think you guys get cold? Go to Wisconsin. Holy smokes. We was up there Thanksgiving. You know how cold it was up there? How cold was it?! That sucked! -Um… [all laughing] It was so cold in Wisconsin, the ice cream machine at McDonald’s was working. [all laughing] Now, I like hot weather. I like when it’s hot and humid. I love that. I lived in Florida for a long time. I love hot and humid. It was so hot down there one time, I seen a squirrel putting talcum powder on his nuts. [all laughing] Now, I don’t like it when it’s hot and humid and I gotta wear blue jeans everywhere. Holy mackerel, walking like this. Uh, we could film four episodes of Swamp People in my pants, all right? It was bad. I went in for a physical, dropped my underbritches, three mushrooms fell out. All right? [all laughing] I ain’t kiddin’! That explains why I kept getting followed by that truffle pig right there. I knew that much. I was two days away from them declaring my crotch a wetland area. [crowd chuckling] But they try to scare everybody now with the heat, don’t they? Try to scare you, make it hotter than it is. When I was growing up, 99 degrees was 99 degrees. Now it’s 99 degrees out, but the feels like temperature’s 103. It feels like? Who come up with that? A fisherman? The “feels like” temperature? Stupid! You know what? My wiener’s three inches, but it feels like nine! [all laughing and clapping] It’s ridiculous. It’s ridiculous. Well, my wife sent me up to the grocery store all by myself the other day to get some feminine products. You know. Celery, carrots, lettuce. [all laughing] Heh! I had to buy some chewing tobacco so I don’t look like a pajama boy sissy in there. Anybody chew tobacco? [man] Yeah! That guy. Ma’am, you. All right, perfect. That’s good. I like chewing tobacco, but I only do it ’cause it keeps you from eating sugar and eating bad food late at night, so… you can see that’s working out real good for me right now. That’s– Now I’m fat, and I got bad teeth! What the hell? I hate that grocery store self-checkout. What in the world? All the enjoyment of working at the store without the satisfaction of getting a paycheck. That’s always nice. You like self-checkout? I hate it. Every time I go in there, I get stuck behind some idiot trying to find a bar code on a cucumber in there. [crowd chuckling] You ever done this? You ever buy a Kit Kat bar? You got like 12 items, you got a Kit Kat bar, and then they look at you and go, “You gonna take that, or you want that in a bag?” That’s when you know you’re a fat-ass right there, all right? I know. They pissed me off last week. They done that with potato salad I had in there. I know! And they put a napkin and a fork on the daggum thing for me! [blows raspberry] Excuse me. Have you, uh… Have you ever seen somebody at the grocery store– You ever seen a fella in there staring at a head of cabbage? I was up there one time. I seen a dude all by himself staring at a head of cabbage. I got a theory about that. That guy’s wife sent him up there to get a head of lettuce. [all chuckling] All cabbage ought to come with a label on it that says, “This is not what your wife wants you to buy.” Three days before Thanksgiving, my wife sends me up to the grocery store to get some yams. 45 daggum minutes, I’m looking for yams. I can’t find a daggum yam. I come home. I said, “They ain’t got no yams up there.” She goes, “You mean to tell me three days before Thanksgiving, they don’t got no sweet potato',\n",
              "  'es at the grocery store?” [crowd chuckling] “I’ll be right back.” [crowd cheering] Yeah. Christmas is my favorite time of year, it goes too quick. But, you know, at our house, we celebrate Christmas every day, and I’ll tell you why. Two reasons. Number one, we love the Lord Jesus. He was born on Christmas Day. -That’s why we celebrate it. And, uh… [crowd cheering] Number two, my sister looks like Burl Ives. [all laughing] I don’t eat good at Christmas, I’ll tell you that much. I got a Fitbit on Christmas Eve, I put it on, it dialed 911. [all laughing] You know what killed me at Christmas last year foodwise? The Kentucky Fried Chicken 12 day Advent Calendar. Holy smokes! Them five golden wings had me turtle-doving all the way to the bathroom. I guarantee you. I ain’t kidding. I could have dropped my pants and dropped a partridge out of a pear tree right there, I guarantee you. Every time I start getting a little too fat at Christmas, so my kids will buy me a Christmas gift to hint around that I’m too fat. You know what they got me last year? A petri dish with flesh-eating bacteria. [all laughing] We run our kids up to the Walmart last year to see the Christmas Village up there. We wasn’t there more than 10 minutes. Somebody was already running a meth lab out of the gingerbread house. [all laughing] The hell? I mean, I love shopping at Walmart, but daggum, that’s like a meth maker’s paradise in there, ain’t it? [chuckles] Walmart’s the only store in the world you can go and see somebody buying 16 boxes of cough syrup and some garden hose, nobody thinks that’s weird. [all laughing] You ever shopped at Walmart after midnight? Holy smokes! Ho, they ought to charge a cover charge in there after midnight. Daggum, it’s like a casting call for Ripley’s Believe It Or Not in that place. If you’ve never been to the circus, go to Walmart after midnight. You’re bound to see a couple of bearded women, a toothless wonder, and the fattest man in the world on a scooter up there. They got good deals after midnight, though. Last time I was up there after midnight, 75% off self-esteem. [all chuckling] That’s right. I walked in there like this. I walked out like this. I was like this. Oh. [audience cheering] That’s right. You can get everything at Walmart. Except good customer service. Holy smokes! Here’s my impression of the hiring practices at Walmart. Let me ask you this. Have you ever cared about anything in your entire life? [all laughing] [sighs] No? All right. You start Tuesday, all right? [chuckles] We’ll put you in the DVD department. My wife wanted to go to Walmart. She’s trying to find the cheapest mop, she could get for something she was doing, so we go to Walmart and get a mop, $4.95. Go up there to pay for the mop, and the lady goes, “You wanna buy the protection on this?” [all chuckling] You know what? I think we’re gonna risk it this time, all right? Got a 95% chance we’re gonna throw that away when we’re done with it, anyways. At our Super Walmart, you can get your hair cut. They got everything! My buddy got his haircut at Walmart. $20 for a haircut. Actually, $5 for a haircut, $15 for the hat you gotta wear the next three weeks, all right? Got a doctor’s office up at the Walmart. Holy smokes! People going in there. I was there the other day. They gave a guy three minutes to live in there. And he ended up getting hired as a door greeter once he walked out that door. [all laughing] [chuckles] I had to go get a flu shot one time. I didn’t wanna go to the doctor, and my wife goes, “Well, shoot! Run up to Walmart. They’re giving flu shots!” Are you kiddin’ me? I ain’t gettin’ a flu shot at Walmart! Daggum. Normally I gotta get vaccinated before I go in there! [all laughing] Get a flu shot at Walmart! The flu’s the last thing I’m worried about at Walmart, all right? Daggu',\n",
              "  'm, they probably got Ebola behind a box in there somewhere I didn’t know about. I was up there one time. There’s a dude up front in a hazmat suit! I’m like, “Is it safe to go in there?” He goes, “Yeah, why?” I go, “You’re in a hazmat suit!” He goes, “No, I work here. I’m collecting the carts.” [all laughing] So every time I go up my local Walmart, I’m friends with a lot of folks up there, but every time I go up there, I see Doug. I always wave to Doug. I walk in, “What’s up, Doug?” Doug kinda, “Hey.” You know, every time, “Hey, Doug!” Let me ask you something. Have you ever called somebody the wrong name for about five years? [all laughing] [laughing] They don’t even acknowledge you’re calling ’em the wrong name? They just make you look like a douche bag for five years. Well, I finally got to talking to Doug three days ago. Her name’s Denise. [all laughing and applauding] [chuckles] So my buddy rented out– He wanted to save money on his wedding. He rented out a Walmart, got married at a Walmart. It was unbelievable. Got married in the jewelry department, and we had the reception in the deli over there, and… we all got our pictures took in the photo booth, and then we left, and they had their honeymoon in the men’s room. It was unbelievable, and there’s– It was a wedding made in China. Let me ask you this. Have you ever gotten a wedding invitation from somebody that you barely know? What the hell? It’s like gettin’ a bill in the mail. I hate weddings. I was in one a while back, holy smokes! I ain’t saying the bride was overweight, but whoo! My buddy caught the garter belt. He’s still been using it to tie up cordwood on his pickup truck, all right? Boy, these were some– You should have seen the bridesmaids! Their corsages was personal pan pizzas, all right? [crowd laughing] I ain’t kiddin’ with you. They all went to school together. They was in the same sorority, so they had their sorority shirts on, you know, “Thelma Eda Tater.” My uncle just got married, 72 years old. My golly. He run out of Viagra on the honeymoon. So he ended up having to use a can of Fix-a-Flat. [all laughing] I know. To make a long story short, he overinflated, and, uh… spent the rest of the night at Jiffy Lube having to get a patch put on him down there. Hey, this is crazy. True story. Check this out. My mother-in-law, last month, won $400 in a hot-dog-eating contest. It’s unbelievable, $400! 40 hot dogs in 10 minutes, she ate. I couldn’t believe it! [scoffs] My mother-in-law not talking for 10 minutes! [all laughing] [applause] I know. Oh, she talks. I know! She can talk. She’s the only woman at the beach getting melanoma on her tongue, all right? I guarantee you. I’m not a big gambler. My– My grandma, holy mackerel. I’m not saying she’s addicted to Blackjack, but she’s got a medical alert bracelet on that says, “In case of emergencies, split the kings.” [all laughing] My wife likes to go with me when I go to Las Vegas, ’cause she likes to go see the Chippendales. Yeah. You know why she likes going to the Chippendales? Why, Larry? She didn’t marry very good. [all laughing] She married a chunkendale. [all laughing] She gives me money to put my clothes back on’s what she does. I like going out there to Las Vegas. That’s where you see all the 1970s-80s classic rock bands singing out there, you know? I like them bands. [cheering] Yeah, the only difference between seeing them bands now and 30 years ago, 30 years ago, go backstage, smell that pot everywhere, and now it smells like pot and Bengay, you go back of them things. They all still got long hair, too, Ain’t that somethin’? Unfortunately, it’s coming out their nose and ears on most of them fellas in there. Here’s one thing you never wanna hear a classic rock band say when you go to the concert. “Here’s one off our new album.” “Honey, let’s',\n",
              "  ' go get a beer. Nobody wants to hear that bullshit.” [audience laughing and clapping] No, sir! I went to see Molly Hatchet, and that was awesome right there. I like old Molly Hatchet. You know what was cool about it? After the concert was over, true story, I got to go in the lobby and take a picture with all the cardboard cutouts of the original members. [all laughing] I like going to the buffets out there, to casino buffets. They delicious. You ever been to the all-you-can-eat pasta buffet at the casino? Holy smokes! That’s the day I got red-flagged by the Plumbers Union right there, I’ll you what? Whoo! I had to keep a hard hat by the toilet for three weeks after I went in there. You ever use all the paper and have to end up finishing with the tube? Have you ever done that at all, anybody? I haven’t done it. I’m asking if you’ve had to do that! I ain’t done that! [crowd chuckling] We got a winner right here. We got a winner. [cheering and applaud] [chuckles] People got no manners at them daggum buffets. There was a guy actually sitting at the buffet! Pissed me off. I walk up there, “You know, you ain’t supposed to stick your face right in the dag–” [grunts] I felt bad he was in a wheelchair. Oh, man. Believe me, I felt bad. Not as bad as I felt, though, when I pushed him out of the way, I’ll tell you that much. “Get out of the way, roller boy.” I’m about to make some bad decisions right here.” [chuckles] I love that Golden Corral, that’s a good restaurant right there. Oh, that is good in there. They ought to have a scoring system at Golden Corral like they do in bowling, you know? Walk in there to eat, they put your name up on the TV screen and show everybody how much food you ate after 10 trips to the buffet. You can pick teams and compete with other fat folks in there, and that’d be something. “Hey, sweetheart, where’s my stretch pants?” It’s League Night at Golden Corral tonight.” I’d seen a couple get engaged at the Golden Corral. Hey, fellas, here’s a tip. If you’re gonna ask your girl to marry you at a Golden Corral, get down on two knees and do it, so she can’t kick you in the nuts. [all laughing] [clapping] I was down in Branson. They got stuff down there, buffets, holy smokes. They got an international buffet in Branson. It is crazy. They got food all the way from Memphis. Got a double-decker buffet. They got a double decker. One of the world’s largest buffets, double decker, spiral staircase. All right, that’s just what all us fat folks have been clamoring for out there, a buffet with a staircase. Oh, damn! I’m gonna get some more of them doughnut holes. “They’re upstairs.” You know what? I’m all right, I guess. I’ll be all right. I’ll stay down here, get some meatballs, put some powdered sugar on them. That’s what I’d do right there. Lot of old folks down there in Branson riding them scooters down there. I find that crazy. These folks have lost their driver’s license two decades ago, but they’re gonna go ahead and let them have motorized vehicles in a room full of pedestrians at the buffets down there. Trying to get food, they’re zipping by like it’s a drive-through. [blows raspberry] I went up to get some potato salad. It was like I was in a live Frogger game all of a sudden. You go like that. What the hell? [screams] I finally got hit head-on by some old dude trying to text and drive. He’s trying to send a crotch shot to Tinder, apparently. I was, uh… at a restaurant one time. You ever been to these restaurants, and you go to the bathroom? It can be any restaurant that you go to the bathroom, and then go take a leak in there, and they got a sign that says, “All employees must wash hands.” That scares the hell out of me right there. They need a sign to tell these folks to wash their hands? I mean, what the hell? Makes me wonder what kind of sign th',\n",
              "  'ey got back in the kitchen we can’t see back there! Don’t snot in the coleslaw. [all laughing] Don’t drip your scrotum in the salsa. [crowd screaming in laughter] [chuckles] I know. Hey, that actually happened one time. That’s a true story. You remember that story? A waiter was mad at a customer, dipped his scrotum in the salsa! [groans] That’s why I always order the hot cheese dip. -[all laughing] -Yeah. [chuckles] That’s right. Most of your waiters aren’t that dedicated, all right? We live in a great country, though. I’ll tell you what? These people bitch about our country. This is an awesome country. We got– You realize there’s a buffet on every street corner in this country? Other people starving. You ever see that starving kid commercial? For eight cents a day, you can feed a starving child– Eight cents a day? Daggum, you can’t keep a gerbil alive for eight cents a day! Daggum, I go through 270 bucks a day, and I’m on a diet. [all laughing] Reading an article in the paper the other day, and… fella jumped off some mountain with one of them kites, Batman kites, and it didn’t work, and he slammed into something. It killed him, and it said, “Diver dies ’cause of freak accident.” Freak acc– That ain’t a freak accident! Y-You jumped off a building with a kite on your back! That’s a dumbass accident, is what that is. A freak accident? Ain’t no freak ac– I’ll tell you what a freak accident is. You’re down there at the local, you know, stop-and-shop down there and getting gas, and unbeknownst to you, there’s two clowns in a knife fight, and one of them falls and stabs you in the face. That’s a freak accident right there, all right? [laughter and applause] [crowd cheering] Yeah, buddy! Read another article one time. This is why I don’t like polls. I see an article. They said they polled in Washington, D.C. They polled 2,500 women, said, “Now that Bill Clinton’s way older, would you sleep with Bill Clinton?” Unbelievable! 94% said, “Not again!” [all laughing] Thank you. Good night. Thank you so much! Good night. Thank you. All right, I’ll stay. I’ll stay. All right, you convinced me. I’m gonna hang out for a while. Remain seated. Stupid polls. “Well, the polls indicate–” I ain’t ever been polled. You ever been polled? I haven’t been polled. Been polled? Been polled? Been polled? There’s only one poll I ever trusted. That’s the polls I do at my shows. And I’d done one last night, and I believe this. I polled all my audience last night. 87% of them said at this point in time during my show, they want their money back. [all laughing] [woman] No! I’ve been, uh– Well, you’s one of the 13%. [all laughing] 87-13, yeah! 13% right there! Yeah! Right? I know my daggum math! [crowd cheering] [laughing] You know, I work a lot of fairs. I love working fairs. It’s awesome, ’cause I grew up in fairs! And I love fairs– What has happened to the clientele at the fairs lately, though? Holy smokes. I was up there the other day. There’s a dude walking like he’s bleeding from the nose, you know, walking like he’s got a daggum fart stuck sideways, heading down that thing down there. Looked like a Greyhound bus overturned. He came walking in, trying to get help or something. I mean, it’s unbelievable at these fairs. By the way, anybody ever ride a Greyhound bus? I used to ride them back in the early days of comedy, holy smokes! Only thing slower than a Greyhound bus is the people on the daggum bus. They’re a good value, though. I went from Sanford, Florida, all the way to Lincoln, Nebraska, one time, $49. Oh, man! 119 days! -[all laughing] -[sighs] Holy smokes! And the big selling point at the time was, “Now with more leg room.” What they needed was more head room so I could have hung myself halfway through the trip! [man] Git-R-Done! -Git-R-Done. So I won one of ’em big stuffed animals one ',\n",
              "  'time at the fair, which I hated, ’cause I had to carry it around the whole time. And I win something, and the guy goes, “What do you want?” and I said, “Well, give me that goofy-lookin’ minion right there, that little minion.” He says, “What?” I said, “That goofy lookin’ minion with the purple hat right there!” He goes, “That’s the manager!” [all laughing] You ever ride the rides at the fair? They scare the heck out of me. My little boy goes, “Daddy, can we ride the roller coaster?” “We ain’t ridin’ a roller– You do realize, son, they put that up in an hour in a parking lot, all right?” Probably got a bunch of parts left over on that daggum thing. “Remember last Christmas when I got you that bicycle and put it together “in 50 minutes, and you got on it, the wheels fell off, “and you racked your nuts, remember that whole day right there?” That’s gonna happen to you on that rollercoaster right there.” He’s like, “Come on, Daddy!” “No, we’re not doing it. That’s it!” So we’re on the roller coaster there, and, uh… Ugh! I was so mad. I almost puked on that thing. It went upside down. [groans] I get done, I go, “You didn’t tell me it went upside down.” The guy running it goes, “It’s not supposed to.” [all laughing] How about that Ferris wheel? You like that Ferris wheel? [sighs] Me, either! Oh, yeah, the Ferris wheel, that’s a lot of fun, isn’t it? Yeah. Nothing I like better in the whole world than being completely bored and terrified at the same time. [chuckles] Which, by the way, is the same thing my wife told me on our honeymoon right there, all right? [chuckles] You ever get stuck on the Ferris wheel? Oh, man! I was up there with my kids. We was stuck. They was crying, freaking out. Trying to calm ’em down. “Don’t worry, kids. We’ll be all right.” “I’m sure that guy running it with seven fingers and a pentagram tattoo, all right, “I’m sure, I’m sure he’ll have us down in no time here.” “Soon as he’s done smoking that joint, I’m sure we’ll be right down out of this deal.” Anybody ever been to the fair on Senior Day? [all chuckling] I went on Senior Day. Most popular ride on Senior Day is the ambulance on the way out of the fair. Daggum, there’s one leaving the scrambler every two minutes in there. Best part about Senior Day, though, it only lasts from 3:30 to 5:00, so that’s a good thing. They got special prizes on Senior Day. I saw an old guy bust a balloon with a dart, and he won a pair of Depends with a picture of Def Leppard on it right there. The food’s different on Senior Day. The fried foods. Anybody ever have fried Lipitor? [all laughing] They got a guy that guesses your weight at the fair. They need somebody to guess your cholesterol level in there. I had a buddy of mine used to do that. He used to try to guess people’s weight at the fair. I went with him one time, and… this girl come up there. She goes, “What do you do?” He goes, “I guess people’s weight.” She goes, “How do you win?” I mean, she was a looker. You could tell. [crowd laughing] He goes, “Well, I guess your weight, and then you get on a scale.” if I’m five pounds either way, I win, you lose.” She goes, “I’m gonna do it.” He’s like, “All right. Uh, oof.” “317.” [crowd laughing] She gets on there, “Ha ha, you lose! 345!” I’m like, “He loses? Are you kiddin’ me?” “I got John Deere attachments that weigh less than you do right now.” “Congratulations. You’re blimp worthy.” [all laughing] But you can gain weight at the fair. It’s all fried, heavy– You like the– You ever eat the corn dogs at the fair? [audience clapping] Oh, yeah! -Oh, I love ’em! Holy smokes! Have you seen the size of the fair corn dogs? Holy smokes! I’m not saying they’re big, but I was eating one at the rodeo, and the horse come by and winked at me. -[crowd laughter and applaud] -[sighs] -[laughs] [man wolf-whistles] They’re goo',\n",
              "  'd value, though. They’re only a dollar. But what they don’t tell you, it’s another $75 for ’em to come out to your house and snake your toilet, all right? They neglect to tell you that. I’ll tell you what I really hate at the fairs. The Porta Potties they got lined up there. Oh, what a disgusting, wretched stuff that is. They ought to have a midway game where you can win scented candles and fly swatters, you know what I mean? I don’t go in ’em anymore. Uh-uh! I was in a Porta Potty five months ago, and, no lie, my eyebrows just grew back last Tuesday, all right? I don’t go in them Porta Potties. When I’m at the fair, I take a plastic bag, and I pee in a ziplock plastic bag. That’s what I do. My wife’s like, “Put that away. You’re embarrassing me!” “What do you mean embarrassed? You ought to walk proudly.” It looks like I won you a goldfish over there!” The fish right there. [laughing] It’s catching on, too. My buddy walked by. “Hey, Larry, look! I’m doin’ it, too! Look at that!” I’m like, “I told you that– Uh-uh, you’re not supposed to poop in it!” “What are you doing?” Get it out of here! Get it out of here!” You ever see what some folks wear at the fair? It’s almost they ain’t got a mirror at the house. I’d seen a guy, about 326 pounds, wearing Lululemon shorts. What in the world? He bent down to pick something up, I could see his Lulu and his lemons, all right? -Daggum… [all laughing] “Get up. You’re scaring my kids. This is ridiculous.” Couple of years ago, my grandma, uh, playing bingo at the fair… won her a spa package. But to be honest, I think they gave her the wrong package. Uh, she said that she was able to tolerate the Botox… but during the Brazilian wax, she farted and blinded the attendant. [audience laughs] [scattered applause] [sighs] Lord, I apologize for that right there, and be with the starving pygmies down in New Guinea. Amen. -[mouthing] Listen, I’m sorry. I’m sorry. [audience cheering] [audience applauds] I saw my grandma topless… two weeks ago. [sighs] That’s the last time I let her drink before a concert, I’ll tell you that much. Daggum! It was embarrassing. It was windy out, so her boobies was flying around like one of them inflatable wind dancers in front of an oil change shop. -You know what I mean? [audience laughing] It was horrible. The Oak Ridge Boys didn’t even want to do an encore after they saw that. “Thanks a lot, Grandma. Your flapping titties just cost me an encore of “giddy up oom poppa maow maow” right there, all right? [scattered applause] I’m kidding. My grandma– My grandma’s awesome. She’s actually a widower. She’s trying to– She’s trying to meet some fellas now. She’s on one of them, uh, elderly dating services. She went on the Internet, Metamucil Mingle. -She’s been on that there for a while. [audience laughs] I think she’s on medical marijuana. I ain’t sure, but… she gave us a quilt the other day made out of Taco Bell wrappers, so there’s something going on there. [audience applauds, laughs] We almost lost my granddad. He’s 93 years old. He almost passed away– We almost lost him on the toilet. He almost died on the toilet. Boy, what a way to go right there. [sighs] Can you imagine dying on the toilet? I mean, what do you say to the relatives at the wake to make ’em feel better? I mean, that’s a tough one there. “Eh, Mrs. Eggerhof, we’re…” “we’re real sorry to hear about Ed. Man, that’s… [sniffles] [sighs] “But at least he died doing what he loved. -“You know, that’s–“ [audience laughing] “We– We heard he fought ’til the bitter end, and that’s the thing.” “He– He wasn’t a quitter, so he got it out.” “We’re excited, and that’s nice. We’re gonna light a match tonight and remember him at midnight, and, hopefully…” [scattered laughter, applause] I read a story one time. A fella got bit by a snake sitting on the toilet. He ',\n",
              "  \"got interviewed. He said, “First thing I thought was I need to call animal control.” -That’s the first thing he thought? -[scattered laughter] If I got bit by something, the first thing I’d think is, “What the hell did I eat last night?” [audience chuckles] “Daggum. My food’s circling back on me here.” [audience laughing] We almost lost my grandpa. He sat on one of ’em power flush toilets. You ever seen them energy-savers? You flush it. There’s a– [mimics flushing] It goes like that? I mean, if you sit on it and flush, it’ll put a hickey on your hind end. I guarantee you. It will. But he sat on there– [mimics flush] Flushed it. Boom! Left nut down the drain. I ain’t kiddin’ with ya. True story! I wish it wasn’t, but that’s a true story. [laughing] I’m trying to help him out. I’m trying to yank him off that thing right here. It’s stuck in that little tube hole in there. [grunting] It’s like daggum Stretch Armstrong. Like… [grunting] And finally– [sputters] It comes lose, slow motion, right in my daggum head. [mimics slow-motion yell] It hits me. [mimics collision] It was like them little knocker balls. You ever seen them little knocker balls? “Boo! Boo! Boo! Boo! Boo!” Bloodied my daggum nose. [audience chuckling] My wife’s like, “What’s going on in here?” [sighs] “His twig and berries went MMA on me, is what happened in here. I have had it.” [sighs] I love him. My grandpa, an alcoholic. We had a family reunion here a while back. We rarely get ’em, but we finally got everybody paroled at the same time, -so we were able to… -[audience laughs] My family’s– [sighs] What in the world! Don’t even wanna talk about ’em sometimes. My brother, he’s all stressed out now ’cause he’s been reading the papers. He thinks he’s gonna lose his job to a robot. I didn’t have the heart to tell him, if he look in his wife’s drawer, he’s already lost his job. [audience laughs, applauds] [whistling] It’s true. It’s true. My sister-in-law, she’s about 4’10”, 290 lbs. She used to model decoy stumps down there at Cabela’s many years ago. She had her stomach stapled last week. Nothing medically. She was at work and accidentally stapled some papers to her stomach there. But my grandpa’s an alcoholic. He’s drunk at the reunion. I said, “Grandpa, why do you drink so much?” He said, “Look around. I’m responsible for all this.” [audience laughs, applauds] [whistling] [Larry chuckles] My cousin hates Halloween. He hates Halloween, boy. I don’t mind Halloween. Out cat died two days before Halloween this year so we left him in the yard for extra decoration for the kids. [audience laughs] Do you dress up for Halloween? [audience members] Yeah! I did this year. My buddy, I wanted to help him out. He’s got a health food business he’s starting, a little gym in there, so I dressed up– Put on a dress and went as a “trans-fat.” [audience laughing] [whistling, cheering] [sighs] I always go with my kids trick or treatin’. You know, but here’s the problem. I’m very flattered people dress like me when they trick or treat. But it’s weird when I go, ’cause I’m just hanging out with my kids! They knock on the door, people are like, “Oh, look, little Batman, little Superman.” Ah! Larry the Cable Guy! That’s a good costume!” Then I always hear somebody from the back of the room. “Who is it?” “He’s dressed like Larry the Cable Guy.” Then I hear, “Ugh! That guy sucks!” [audience laughs] What the hell? Next time, I’m gonna go as Foxworthy, all right? How’s that? -That’s right. [chuckles] -[whistling] -I don’t care if anybody thinks he sucks. [whistling continues] [groans] Ugh! Anyway, my cousin hates Halloween. Hates it. He says to me, “I am so sick and tired of Halloween.” “I’m trying to watch the daggum TV show.” “‘Trick or treat?’ Every two minute– ‘Trick or treat.'” Gotta get up and give them candy.” I’m like… “[\",\n",
              "  'sighs] Calm down. [chuckles] Buddy, you ain’t gotta participate.” There’s ways you can get around the Halloween and kids.” You know what he did? Went down and registered as a sex offender. [audience laughing] I’m like, “You do know all you gotta do is turn your porch light off, right?” [laughing] You do know that?” He goes, “You think I’ve done something stupid?” “Yeah, I think you’ve done something stupid!” You’re the Sheriff, for heaven’s sake!” -[mouthing indistinctly] [audience laughing] [scattered applause] I always check my kids’ candy for poisons and razor blades. “Hold on, kids. You can’t eat that yet.” “I gotta check ’em for poisons and razor blades.” They come down later on. “Where’s all our candy?” “We live in a pretty bad neighborhood. I’ll be honest with ya.” “I swear we’re gonna move next year. I promise that.” “They ruined everything?” “No, not everything.” “They didn’t touch that box of raisins in there, but they…” Tell you what. Them Butterfingers, they was riddled with poison in there.” [audience laughs] I can’t eat like that no more. It sucks getting fat! Man, I’m trying to lose some weight. I gotta do something. It’s ridiculous! Ugh! I got on the trampoline the other day with my kids. I had two jumps, had to get off! I wasn’t tired or nothing. I had to get a ladder to get my boy out of a tree. [audience laughs] And it stinks, gettin’ older and fatter! And I used to be something back in the day, boys. I used to be something! I did. I used to run cross-country. You Google it. I think I still hold the state record for taking the most shits in the woods. [audience laughs] But I’m on a diet now. I’m eating nothing but Fruit Loops. But my wife has me on a… [audience laughs] My wife has me on a diet now where I can have one cheat day. So I can have a hamburger with the cheese and the bun… one day a week. [quickly] Or anytime I drive by a fast-food restaurant when she’s not with me in the car. -All right, not there. -[audience laughing] [loud whistle] [normally] She’s a stickler, too, I tell you what. She’d be up there sleeping, 2:30 in the morning. Dog go down there and bark at the door for ten minutes, she don’t hear nothing. She’s racked out. I gotta go down there and let the dog out. So next day, I go down. I’m kinda hungry. I pour a little– little bowl of Cap’n Crunch down there. I hear, “Get out of the Cap’n Crunch!” [audience laughing] “What the hell? I should have barked when I poured that Cap’n Crunch in there, is what I should’ve done. It sucks gettin’ old and fat, I’ll tell you. I remember when my beard turned white, my– my wife was, like, trying to comfort me. “Oh, that’s okay, honey. I like somebody with a little salt and pepper in their beard.” Made me feel a little better. Then she goes, “It’s the corn in your teeth that’s disgusting.” -All right? [audience laughs] I was gonna say broccoli, but none of y’all believe I eat broccoli. -All right, so I ain’t saying that. [audience laughing] [sighs] Here’s the thing about getting older. You start losing your daggum memory. I can’t– I have a hard time remembering stuff now. It’s so frustrating. Have you ever left your groceries on the roof of your car? Yeah? For three weeks? -You ever did that? [audience laughing] I’m a hypochondriac. I always think I’m dying of something. I’m freaking out. Had a red blotch right there one time for a week, it’s freaking me out. So I go get a biopsy on it. Tested positive for picante sauce. [audience laughing] [sighs] Idiot! Cost me $1,000 to do that! Good news is, he wrote me a prescription for napkins, so that was pretty good, I guess. I always think I’m dying. Don’t ever look nothing up on the Internet, ’cause it ain’t good. It’s always lupus or Lou Gehrig’s, that’s what it is, one of them two. I think I got both of them damn diseases. Seen a commercial th',\n",
              "  'e other day for breast implant leakage. I had every damn symptom of a breast implant leakage in there. These stupid things. I ain’t kidding with you. Don’t ever look it up. It’s always lupus. Except for one time I had a lump right here. Honest. “What in the hell?” I look it up. “Ah, brain cancer That’s–“ [audience laughs] “That’s it for me. I’m a dead man. I got brain cancer.” You never learn nothing on the Internet, medically, looking it up. Except one time, I did. I found out that jock itch is also the name of a porn star in France. [laughing] And what is it about getting in your mid-50s, your big toe nail’s like a manhole cover all of a sudden? Holy smokes! I went to clip it the other day, the pin popped out of the clipper system in there. Holy smokes! Finally, I chip it off, hits my kid in the head, knocks him out, he’s bleeding from the eyeball. [audience laughing] I hate the waiting room, too, the walk-in clinic. Holy smokes, nobody’s got any manners in there, you know. Everybody’s sitting in there, hawking, hacking, coughing, farting, burping, belching– What the heck? Then you go see the nurse, “What are you here to see the doctor for?” “Well, it was a chest cold. Now I think I got hepatitis after being in there and…” Gotta go in there and wait ten hours for something. I could walk in there on bloody nubs, pulling my legs in a wagon in there… gotta sit for six hours. I ain’t sitting nowhere over an hour if I… ain’t got a wine list or something in there. [audience chuckling] Serve some beer. Boy, that’d be a game changer right there, wouldn’t it? Walk-in clinics start serving wine? [chuckles] “Excuse me, nurse. What wine do you recommend that goes with my itchy butthole?” [audience laughing] “Maybe a Boone’s Farm? Maybe a cherry wine or something like that or…” Then I finally get in to see the doctor, I got to wait on him in his room for another 45 minutes. Freezing cold, I’m in a backless paper gown. I’m a pair of high heels away from Caitlyn Jenner sitting in that office in there. [audience cheering] [thud] -Daggum. Yeah! -[whistling] Then he comes in there, and he looks at me. He looks around me. He looks in me. He lifts stuff up. He sighs a couple of times. It’s like a bad episode of Storage Wars every time I go to the doctor. [audience laughs] Then I spend all that money, waste all that time. You know what his diagnosis was? “You’re too fat.” [audience chuckles] Yeah, no kiddin’. What the hell? I could’ve stayed at home, and my wife’d tell me that for free. He’s like, “What are you gonna do about it?” “I don’t know. Hang out with people fatter than me, I guess.” Maybe take a selfie next to a cement mixer or something.” He’s like, “Well, you need to eat better. What did you eat last week?” “I don’t know. Go get my T-shirt.” [audience laughs] He says, “I want you to join a gym.” I ain’t joining a gym. Last time I was down there, I left a skid mark on the yoga mat. I ain’t going down to that gym. [audience laughing] He goes, “Well, get on a treadmill then. “Find a treadmill. Get on it. But start slow, and ease into it.” I don’t want you to have a heart attack.” Oh, that’s comforting right there. That’s when you know you’re a fat-ass right there. When cardiovascular exercise is like Russian roulette all of a sudden. “Honey, how much time you doing on the treadmill?” “I don’t know. Hopefully 30 minutes. I ain’t sure, all right?” “How’d he die?” “Sweatin’ to the oldies.” Weirdest thing I ever seen.” My buddy’s all mad at his doctor, ’cause he’s seen him driving a brand-new Mercedes-Benz. That’s good. Means you got a good doctor. I want my doctor to have a brand-new Mercedes-Benz. I don’t want to be a hour and a half away from open-heart surgery, my doctor show up in a ’78 Plymouth. You know, the door open up, a bunch of Pringles cans come falling out of the',\n",
              "  ' thing. [audience laughing] It’s like, “He thinks he’s better than me.” He is better than you. He’s a doctor. You’re a bouncer-slash-cook down there at Grits and Tits. I will say, though, and I hate admitting this, but sometimes I do think… that a doctor will talk you into a real expensive surgery just ’cause it’s more money. And I never used to think that way ’til after my hysterectomy, but… [audience laughing] I went and had a colonoscopy done. Boy, you ought to see the looks of the folks in that place. The looks on their faces, sittin’ in there, waiting on a colon– [chuckles] They all had that look like Wile E. Coyote seconds before he got hit by that anvil, you know what I mean? There was actually a guy sitting in a corner, holding up a sign that said, “Yikes.” They’re all for– And nobody’s nice to you. That’s the thing. I mean, not even the staff is treating you nice. And you know what’s fi’ing to happen. What in the hell? I mean, even Jiffy Lube puts out coffee and donuts. [audience laughing] And if I’m gonna go up there and they’re gonna start shoving stuff up my hind end, the least they could do is put out some bear claws. I was worried about that one. I said, “Oh, I gotta get a colonoscopy.” My wife’s like, “What are you worried about?” “Because they gonna put a camera up my hind end.” She goes, “Well, your head’s been up there eight months.” [audience laughing] All right, you do know you’re not funny, right? Worst part of the colonoscopy is the night before when you gotta drink the “go juice.” Holy smokes! I called waste management to give ’em a heads-up is what I did. “Hey, you better get some extra knob turners down there, ’cause… you’re fi’ing to have a donnybrook headed your way in five minutes.” Well, I was in there. I was reading a medical journal thing they had on the stuff they could do and what they– you know, all the operations they can do. Boy, what a time to be alive. I’d rather have a surgery now than 50 years ago. But some of the stuff they do– I read this article. They said they can now start to grow female reproductive organs in petri dishes for women that’s born with reproductive deformities. Ain’t that something? Boy… Like to be a kid now and get that chemistry set, I’ll tell you that much. Holy smokes. Ho. “Hey, where’s Larry at?” “Uh, he’s in the basement hoeing his vagina garden down there.” -[chuckles] That’s right. [audience laughing, clapping] Tell you what. Git-R-Done. That’s right. Yeah, they come up with a Twinkie tree, I’d never leave the house, I guarantee you. I guarantee you that. [audience laughing] I was in there. There was a woman breast-feeding in there, which is fine, that’s what you do. But if I’m being honest with you, the kid had to be four years old. [audience laughing] Isn’t that weird? [woman in audience] Yeah. I mean, I ain’t a woman. I don’t know, but four seems a little weird to me. I mean, I think when you’re breast-feeding, when the kid starts to incorporate salt shakers and a lime, you know what I mean? [chuckles] When he’s like, “Give me a squirt for my coffee,” maybe he’s a little too old for that, you know, maybe. Maybe it’s time to get him on the, uh, you know, titty milk 12-step program there in your area. I remember when we had kids, my wife used to have a breast pump, and she’d pump bottles. One time, she said, “Hey… you wanna taste that?” [chuckles] No. [audience laughing] Ha. She’s like, “Why? It’s better for you than cow’s milk.” [chuckling] Yeah, all right, whatev– Look, I’ve been on cow’s milk for some 50-odd years. I’m doing pretty good, all right. [chuckles] Only people I’ve ever seen drink your milk poop their pants eight times a day, all right, so… -[chuckles] [audience cheers] Ha. Ha. Yeah. [audience member whistling] Word out on the street is your product ain’t that good. -All right? [au',\n",
              "  'dience laughing] I seen a little baby, one-year-old, wearing glasses. How’d they know a baby needs glasses at one? What, he go to breast-feed and sucked the nose for nine months? [audience laughing] My neighbor’s got a newborn baby. And, uh, he fell in the toilet the other day, so… they got him sleeping in a bag of rice this weekend. [audience laughing] I got kids. I love my kids so much, but I tell you what, it’s unbelievable… how the Lord can create life. I mean, it’s unbelievable. You just see that little baby’s head pop out, you whole life is transformed and changed, and you just love it so much, and you cry, you know. And then, ten years later, that same thing, you wanna slap the living piss out of it, you know what I mean? It’s unbelievable, the whole different– I remember when my little boy was born. I was scared to hit a speed bump leaving the hospital for fear his head would go like that and crack open or somethin’. Here I am ten years later, driving down the interstate trying to drive, trying to get the perfect whack on the middle of his frickin’ head. And, uh, my wife’s like, “Be careful, you’re gonna crash.” I don’t give a shit. I’ll kill everybody in this car right now, all right? I could care less. I’ve had it with him right now. [audience hooting] It’s ridiculous. [audience hooting, whistling, clapping] Yeah, the Pope came out and said, “Married couples should have more kids.” That’s easy for him to say. Daggum Pope ain’t got no kids. How ’bout I drop my kids off at the Vatican for a couple of hours? How’s that sound? Yeah, see if they can get grape jelly out of the Pope hat, all right? [audience laughing] That’s why I never understood kidnapping. Really? You wanna put up with this bullshit? Are you kiddin’ me? Holy– You kidnap my kids, they’d be back on the porch in two days with an apology note strapped to the side of them. [audience hooting] Oh, but I love ’em. I don’t care what age it is, you put up with– I love ’em so much, I tell you. You know, I was gonna home school my kids, and them my wife reminded me, uh, we’re idiots. [audience laughing] [Larry chuckling] [chuckles] Hey, I was home schooled, and I-I loved it. I finished, uh, second in my class. [audience laughing] [chuckles] It wasn’t until two years ago, my mom told me that she’d made the dog valedictorian. -I don’t know what it is. [audience laughing] I worry about my kids. Oh, they’re so sweet. My little girl’s such a sweetie, and my little boy’s got a kind heart. And I just worry about bullies in sch– Oh. You know, I was bullied by a fourth grader one time, and, oh, I hated every minute of it. So I finally– I went home and told my wife she’s gotta go pick the kids up, ’cause I can’t handle it down there no more. Hey, you laugh. There’s some big-ass fourth graders out there. I mean, this girl, she wasn’t small. I’ll guarantee you that much. Remembered Father’s Day and my kids. By the way, Father’s Day is the biggest piece of crap holiday they got out there. That’s where your wife and kids take your money and buy you crap you didn’t want to begin with. All right? But my kids, they’re so sweet. They drew a picture of me. and put “We love you, Daddy” on it. And– Which is awesome. And I felt so bad, because instead of me going, “Man, I love my kids. This is–” The only thing I could think… when they gave it to me was… “I’m not that fat, am I?” [audience laughing] And it bugged me, and I told them, “Kids, I like the picture, but I’m not that fat.” They’re like, “Yeah, you are.” I’m like, “No, I’m not.” Yeah, so they took the picture and held it up to my cellphone, and it unlocked it. [audience laughing] Took a family vacation. Everybody wants to go canoeing, which I didn’t wanna do. Canoeing’s an old Indian word that means “butt blisters.” [audience laughing] Yeah, canoeing’s a lot of fun',\n",
              "  ' when you’re a fat guy. Yeah, that’s a lot of fun right there. My little boy’s in the front. I’m in the back. Going down the river for five miles, popping a wheelie, going in circles. Got a catfish stuck to my nipple. I can’t get it off of there. He’s like, “Why do I gotta wear a life jacket?” Because if this thing tips over, it’ll keep you alive long enough for me to save the Kentucky Fried Chicken over there, all right? [audience laughing] You know what the difference between canoeing with your wife and canoeing with your little boy is? [man] What? When you’re done canoeing, your little boy is still talking to you. [audience laughing] [chuckling] My wife’s– My wife’s 13 years younger than me. -[hooting] -Git-R-Done. I’ll never forget the preacher’s words. “I now pronounce you husband and incoming freshman.” You know who doesn’t like it when you marry younger women? Older women. [chuckles] Not all of them. Just her mom and her aunt. Here’s the bad thing about being married to somebody younger than you. They’re already ready to go out and start doing stuff you’re sick and tired of doing. You know? Like… leaving the house. [audience laughing] Fourth of July, she’s like, “Let’s go see the fireworks display.” “All right. What channel is it on? I’ll be down in a minute.” I know my wife loves me, though, ’cause she married me looking like this. [chuckles] The good thing about marrying somebody that looks like this is there ain’t a lot to drop-off on the years to go by. You know, It’s like buying a Kia, you know? Sure, it’s a Kia, but it ain’t gonna get no shittier than that. All right? [audience laughing] People said to me, “You know, your wife only married you ’cause you’re famous.” And I asked her. I said, “Did you marry me ’cause I’m famous?” She said, “No. I married you ’cause you’re rich.” [chuckles] [audience laughing] What? I’m just kidding. I did ask her, though. I said, “Did you marry me ’cause I got money?” She goes, “No. It’s our money.” [audience laughing] My wife… uh, I love her so much. She goes to the spa every now and then. And I can’t ever figure the spa out. I go, “Why do you go the the spa all the time?” “‘Cause I like to sit in there and soak and think about stuff and relax.” “Well, we got a tub at the house. Can’t you soak in the tub at the house?” She goes, “Yeah, but at the spa, you don’t sit on the toilet and stare at me.” [audience laughing] My wife is sexy, too, boy. She likes to talk when we make love. That’s sexy right there. -[audience member hoots] -Oh, I love that. Make love every day. She says stuff like, uh, “You okay?” [audience laughing] “Why’s your face red?” “Blink twice if you can hear me.” I’m like, “Get off my leg. Oh, my chest. Ah, my chest. Get off. Get off.” Making love to my wife is like having a stroke with a happy ending. [audience laughing] I feel bad for her, too, ’cause I’m not handy around the house. [chuckles] I’m a comedian, you know? One time, I put up a towel rack. It fell off seven times. So she went and got a stud finder, and he put it up. I went shopping with her one time. And I hate this. Do I– “Does this make me look fat”? I hate that. I don’t know. Look what I’m wearing. Do you think I’m a fashion plate right here? “Honey, does this– Do I look fat in this?” “I don’t know. How much is it?” I’ll tell you if you look fat in it or not.” $400? [imitates pig squealing] [audience cheering] [Larry chuckling] Yeah. Anybody see the movie Cars? -[audience whistling, cheering] -All right, everybody seen that? That’s right. That’s how I’m able to afford these fancy britches right here. -[man] Yeah. -[Larry chuckling] I got a funny story to tell you about that. Here’s how I got that part. John Lasseter told me that I didn’t have to audition or nothing. He said he’d been to 200 celebrities, 150 voice-over artists. He didn’',\n",
              "  \"t have any clue. One day left, picked up Blue Collar Comedy CD. He heard my voice. Said, “That’s my tow truck. Get him on the phone.” [chuckles] That’s how I got the job. -It’s the craziest thing ever. -[audience cheering] I was so thankful. I’m not kidding. [whistling from audience] So thankful. So I go out there, and I’m nervous. I go out there. I’m nervous. It’s John Lasseter and Pixar, and he shows me around, and he puts me in this booth, and there’s the script, and he says, “All right. Just wanna let you know that, uh… “when we do these voices, I might, uh… “have you do the same voice, “same line, 12 times, but don’t think you’re doing bad.” We just get a lot of takes.” And then I said, “Okay, well how do you want– “How is Mater? Is he, kind of, a fast talker?” He goes, “What do you mean?” I go, “Well, just, I don’t know.” He goes, “He’s you. You’re Mater.” I said, ‘Well, yeah, but–” “No, just be you.” I’m like, “All right.” So my first line was, “My name is Mater, like ‘Tuh-Mater’ without the ‘Tuh'”. So he did his line and he pointed at me, and I just went, “My name is Mater, like ‘Tuh-Mater’ without the ‘Tuh'”. And he started laughing and said, “All right, we got it.” [audience cheering] [Larry chuckling] Yeah, right? [chuckles] I think he might have done one more, and that was it, and– So now we do the whole movie. It was awesome. Everybody’s great. Six years later, we’re on the Fantasy Cruise, of Disney’s Fantasy ship. And it’s the very first time it ever went out there, and they’re all there, all the Disney folks, the Pixar folks. I did a show in the showroom and… and I thought this was the weirdest request, but I did it. John Lasseter asked me to go up and take the ship’s microphone and make a ship’s announcement. It goes all over the ship. And then, once I’m done as Mater telling everybody thanks for coming on the ship, then have Mater introduce you, and you tell everybody thanks for coming to your show. And I thought, “Well, that’s kind of weird, but… [chuckles] I’ll go ahead and do it.” And we laugh every time we think about it, but it’s the actual… uh, message I did on the boat. This is what it sounded like. “Hey, everybody. This is Mater, like ‘Tuh-Mater’ without the ‘Tuh.'” “Boy, I tell you what, I’m happier than a tornado in a trailer park “that you come on this Fantasy Cruise, and shoot, daggum, “if you ever get to Radiator Springs, “you and me will do us some backward driving.” “All right, then, don’t forget. You and me, we is best friends.” “Now here’s my buddy, Larry the Cable Guy, to say something to you.” Hey, everybody. This is Larry, the Cable Guy.” [audience laughing] Same voice! God bless you guys. Thank you so much… for an awesome night tonight. I hope you enjoyed everything, and Git-R-Done! [audience cheering] [Larry] Thank you so much. Thank you.

Thank you. Thank you. All right, we only have an hour. (audience laughing) Have I offended anybody yet? We, it’ll happen. It happens fast! We have gotten soft. We have gotten soft. Watch this. What are you allergic to? Nothing! Nothing! Gluten wouldn’t take down our generation. (audience laughing) We’re not allergic to things like peanuts. You know why? Our parents made us eat peanuts. (audience laughing) They made us eat peanuts until we weren’t allergic to peanuts. (audience applauding) And if our throat started to close up, you know how they opened it up? They shoved more peanuts down it! (audience laughing) I’m not allergic to germs. Watch this. Shake my hand. Look at that, that’s how you shake a hand. I don’t care about ger, listen. I’m starting to really hate people. Let me start out with that. I went to shake a guy’s hand the other day. He goes, “Oh no-no-no-no-no-no. I just washed.” (audience laughing) That’s when I want to shake your hand! (audience applauding) Not when it’s filthy. “Oh oh good timing. I, I was about to wash. Now I can fit another shake in.” Do you, do you see how crazy it’s gotten? I was raised on germs, okay? Germs are good for you. I didn’t wash my hands until I was 22! (audience laughing) In my family, there were five people, one sink, one hand towel. Five people shared one hand towel that never dried. (audience laughing) It’s still wet. When I got home, it’s still wet from 1989. (audience applauding) And I just found out recently that none of us ever touched the front of the towel, ’cause that’s where we thought everybody else was touching. (audience laughing) We all snuck around back. Turns out that’s where the polio, scabies, hand-foot, mouth, head, shoulders, knees and toe',\n",
              "  's, knees and toes disease was hangin’ out! We didn’t have antibacterial soap when I was a kid. No! The old germs killed the new germs! (audience laughing) (audience applauding) We didn’t have this little wussy pump soap that you guys, can you say “Wussy”? Can you say “Wussy”? I don’t wanna upset the little millennial word police! (audience laughing) “Orny said, “Wussy’! Orny said, “Wussy’!” How about these people on Twitter that have five followers. Why don’t you just text everybody you know? (audience laughing) (audience applauding) I like germs. Germs make you stronger! We didn’t even have pump soap. We had a bar of soap. We had a bar of soap that lasted so long, it rusted, it rusted! It would crack and rust, and in the cracks there were rivers of mud. This is what you used to wash your hands. I have an immunity. I shake hands, I don’t care. I grew up in a time, you’re not gonna believe, how old are you? Me? No, the kid, what is this? What, how old are you? 12. 12! (laughing) That’s adorable. Look at him. Let me tell ya something. What’s your name? Hudson. Hudson? (audience laughing) Hudson You not gonna believe this. I grew up in a time, Hudson, when salad bars, there was no glass! (audience laughing) (audience applauding) There was nothing in between you and the lettuce! It was like the Wild West! People got right up in it! You watched them. You watched people like, ptuh! Ptuh! They spit all over. They spit all over it, Hudson, and you ate it! You ate it! (audience applauding) That was the price you paid for unlimited lettuce! (audience laughing) (audience applauding) Now you can’t get near it. The salad bar, it’s like they got that glass up. You gotta, you gotta lean in against the glass. You can’t get near the lettuce, but your face is licking, it’s disgusting, the, “I’m going in for the baby corn! Does anybody want the, hold my foot! Hold my foot!” I’m in a level two yoga move, trying to get the baby corn! You know, we used to touch door handles in the bathroom? (audience laughing) Remember that? Wasn’t so long ago! Then all of a sudden everybody started to take a paper towel, like, like they committed a crime and they’re wiping prints. (audience laughing) Now we got a problem, right, ’cause the eco-freako people, have taken away the paper towels. They’re making us stick our hands into this, Dyson, hand kidnap, it’s dangerous! It’s dangerous, it, it throws your hand around at 500 miles per hour. It’s narrow and you, and you don’t want to touch the sides, so it’s, it’s like that, the game “Operation.” It’s like, (imitating buzzer) shit! I touched the side! Now I gotta wash ’em again. I got it this time. (imitating buzzer) Damn it! And you still don’t want to touch the door handle, right? So now, now you gotta hang out in the bathroom like you’re a creep! Waiting for somebody to come in, and then slide by ’em like a crab, like a, some sort of military operation, like I’m, I’m doing CrossFit exercises in the bathroom! (audience laughing) This is so, if you have to catch up, it’s okay. (audience laughing) (woman laughing) Get her closer to a microphone. This is the world we, (audience laughing) we have gotten too soft. We have gotten too soft. (audience laughing) Now I’ve lost my place. (audience laughing) (audience applauding) I just want to make sure we get it all. Well, you don’t have to zoom in on the list, do ya? (audience laughing) Can we make this look spontaneous? (audience applauding) You can’t get me sick! You can’t get me sick! We didn’t have bottles of water when I was a kid. Filtered water? That’s what your kidneys are for! (audience laughing) (audience applauding) We drank out of a hose! (crowd cheering) And it wasn’t even our hose. (audience laughing) We went up to some house we didn’t even know, and we just turned on the hose and dirt flew out and spider eggs and, lead. Lead runs through my veins! We had to drink out of a hose because we weren’t allowed ins',\n",
              "  'ide of the house until five p.m. (audience laughing) (audience applauding) I don’t know what the parents were doing till five p.m. ‘Cause we weren’t allowed inside of the house, until five p.m. Our parents, every day, they said, “Get lost! Come back at five.” And if we didn’t come back, you know what they did? They had another kid! (audience laughing) (audience applauding) They didn’t know where we were all day! I was with my friend Sean. We were biking. He got hit by a car! We then sat outside of his house until five p.m. (audience laughing) (audience applauding) Until we were allowed in. We told his parents and then they stitched him up. (audience laughing) We have gotten soft. We have gotten soft, Hudson. I don’t even know if you’re a millennial or if you’re, if you’re post a problem of the millennial. (audience laughing) But these millennials are out here, Where are people in their 20s? (crowd cheering) The most annoying people in our society, these, these, look at ’em. Look at ’em! Look at this guy right here. No, look at you. Yes, you. How old are you? 27. You are dumb! You are dumb! (audience laughing) He’s so dumb, he’s laughing while I’m calling him dumb. (audience laughing) I’m kidding. What is your name, buddy? My name is Perry. erry, what a masculine name. (audience laughing) Let me tell ya somethin’, Perry. Your generation came onto our planet, and you ruined it! You changed too much. I mean, they’re out there right now judging me, on a criteria I did not grow up with. (audience laughing) I don’t even know what gender I am anymore! (audience laughing) (audience applauding) I mean, I’m not being flip, there’s a lot of new choices, and I haven’t done all the research, you know. Maybe I fit into something else, and I’m fine with that. I’m ready for a change. Millennials have taken away all the fun. It’s not fun anymore, do you realize that? Everything’s gotta be equal for you guys. Everything’s gotta be eq, can’t be a man in bed, can ya? What’s, what’s the fun talk for a millennial guy like? You’re with a girl like, “Are you my little equal? Who’s my, (audience applauding) who’s my little equal? Who’s my strong, independent?” Get that guy laughing right there! Get it on him! Look at him! I haven’t had an erection since the millennials took over. (audience laughing) You have to have sex on the side so nobody’s in a power position. (audience laughing) (audience applauding) These millennials came onto our planet. You changed the way we sneeze. For thousands of years, (imitating sneezing) this was fine. (audience laughing) This, this is bullshit! (audience laughing) (audience applauding) This is dumb. This makes no sense at all. The hand was made for sneezing. This is a perfect vessel. This, ricochets back into your face. I got stuck in there one time. It doesn’t work. I wash my hands several times a day. I’ve never washed this. (audience laughing) (audience applauding) I’ve never seen somebody go, “I just.” go into a public restroom, “I, I, I just, I just sneezed into my,” there’s not even a name for this, “my, my millennial pit. I just sneezed into my…” (audience laughing) (audience applauding) They’re so sensitive and they all come preinstalled with ADD. (audience laughing) They all have ADD and they love to tell ya. “I have ADD!” I’m like, “You’re lucky to have ADD.” In this day and age, with all these distractions, Can you imagine having ADD in the 1600s? (audience laughing) Maybe a horse went by every four hours. They’re out sitting, they’re churning the butter. “This, this, this sucks! I’ve got, I’ve got a disorder, something.” Something distract me. What was that, a leaf? No, back to this, this.” I’m so glad I grew up before social media. I, I really, I couldn’t handle that in high school. Ooh, ooh. (audience applauding) I feel bad for the young people. I mean, you know, In high school, I, I suspected I was a loser. Now, now it would be digitally confirmed, you ',\n",
              "  'know? I can handle it as an adult, you know what I mean? It’s like, hey, if it wasn’t for social media, I wouldn’t know how much stuff I wasn’t being invited to. (audience laughing) They’re too sensitive. Everybody’s gotta just chill out, chill out. We’ve lost our minds. And I’m not talking about the gluten people. (audience laughing) I have been going after the gluten people now for 10 years, for 10 years. People that have been watching me for the last 10 years know I was on top of this, this fad diet back when we thought it was called “glutton.” Back when we thought it was called “glutton.” (audience applauding) It’s a marketing scam to get you to buy some products. Now, I know some people actually have, okay, so I know it. Don’t, don’t, don’t go after me on social media. (audience laughing) I know some people actually have, you know, ’cause they come up to me after shows. They’re, they’re angry. They’ll come up and they’ll go, “Um, I don’t think it’s funny that you joke about cisiasics disease.” (audience laughing) Why’s everybody laughing? Ciliastic disease kills millions of… All I’m saying is, if it was real, I’d know how to pronounce it. That’s what I’m saying. (audience laughing) (audience applauding) All I’m saying is we’ve been on this planet for 200,000 years. In the last, 10, we all discovered we can’t eat wheat? It’s bullshit. It’s bullshit! It’s bullshit! (audience applauding) (crowd cheering) Do you know that sometimes if I eat a walnut, my tongue gets a little itchy? (audience laughing) I’ve never told anybody this. (audience laughing) (audience applauding) I just avoid walnuts. I had to Google how long we’ve been on the planet for. Did you know the answer? Yeah. Took me three days, ’cause I put in Google, “How long, ” The first thing it suggested was “boil corn.” (audience laughing) I’d like to know that. I didn’t know there was a recipe. I’ve been guessing my whole life. I just throw the corn into a pot and every few minutes I yell out, “Do you think the corn is ready?” So now I’m on YouTube watching videos, on how to boil corn. (audience laughing) People are making videos on how to boil corn. I’m leaving comments. “Couldn’t stop watching your video on how to boil corn. Riveting! Watched all 12 minutes even though it only takes eight to boil corn.” (audience laughing) They’re making videos on how to boil corn. There are some real losers in this world! (audience laughing) I’m telling you, I’m telling you, I’ve been after this. I don’t like fad diets. I don’t like, like the, the new ones, like the Paleo diet. Do you know what that is? Yeah. Yeah. You eat, you eat whatever the caveman ate. Well, that makes a lot of sense, since they all died when they were 12. (audience laughing) (audience applauding) These idiots are like, “I’m gonna eat like a caveman. I’m gonna have it delivered, just like the caveman did.” (audience laughing) And how do we even know the caveman was skinny? By the pictures they drew of themselves on the wall? I’ve never taken a fat picture of myself. I know the skinny angle. (audience laughing) (audience applauding) You don’t think the caveman was deleting the fat caveman self, cave selfie sketch things? You don’t… I don’t like fad anything. Now there’s something called Prevagen. Do you know what this is? It’s a supplement for memory loss and it’s an ingredient they recently discovered in jellyfish. Because when you think memory, you think jellyfish! (audience laughing) These things beach themselves every single day. And they can’t find the ocean and it’s right behind them. Going, (imitating whooshing). This is how ridiculous we’ve gotten. We’ve gotten ridiculous. I was thrown off of a TV station in Portland, Oregon, because I was making fun of gluten. (audience laughing) I was in Portland, Oregon, and I was on a TV station, and I said, “Gluten doesn’t exist.” And the anchor got really angry. She goes, “Yes, it does!” (audience laughing) I’m ',\n",
              "  'like, well, it scared me. I’m like, “Well, what, what, what proof do you,” By the way, this is in December. Just so you know for historical purposes. (audience laughing) I go, “What, what proof do you have?” She said, “Because we have an entire section in the store.” (audience laughing) And I said, “Well, so does Santa Claus.” (audience laughing) (audience applauding) “Doesn’t make him real.” And they threw me off. They were, they got that angry. People were commenting on their Facebook page so fast, they threw me off. And I thought, “Well, that’s it. Who, who cares? It’s Portland, who cares?” (audience laughing) “Nobody’s gonna ever hear about it.” And then about four months ago, I was, in North Carolina. Yeah. Are you from North Carolina? (chuckling) (audience laughing) By the way, good luck getting unsweetened iced tea in North Carolina. (audience laughing) I should have just stood up in the restaurant and yelled, “Who won the Civil War? (audience laughing) Give me a cup of We Won unsweetened, please.” I’m in North Carolina, a guy comes up to me in the street and he said, “Is it true you don’t believe in Santa Claus?” (audience laughing) I go, “That’s a weird to thing ask an adult in June.” (audience laughing) I said, “Why are you asking me that?” And he said, “Because I read a story about how you were kicked off of a TV station in Portland on your Wikipedia page.” (audience laughing) And that’s when I realized one of these millennials told on me! (audience applauding) So I went to my Wikipedia page and, I printed it out to show you tonight. (audience laughing) I know the young people laugh. Like, at a show once, somebody yelled out, they go, “That’s cute. You still print stuff?” (audience laughing) Yeah, I’m in my 40s, I still print stuff. You know what else I do? I make plans a week in advance and I keep ’em. (audience laughing) (audience applauding) You know what else I do? When I take somebody’s picture, I count to three. (audience laughing) Young people just hold up the camera and then they walk away. I’m like, “I, I thought you wanted a picture.” They’re like, “I got 48.” I’m like, “Where was I for that?” Here’s my actual Wikipedia page. This is my actual Wikipedia page. And by the way, I’ve been banned from making changes to my own page. (audience laughing) I would change something, they go, “What’s your source?” I’m like, “It’s me.” (audience laughing) “On December 10, 2016, Orny caused controversy on a local Portland, Oregon, TV show by implying Santa Claus was not real.” (audience laughing) (audience applauding) Now, I didn’t imply it, I said it, but I’ve been banned from making changes. Here are the actual comments people left on the TV station’s Facebook page. This is “AM Northwest,” ready? I’m gonna read you two comments. Cathy Hunt says, Well, if she’s gonna call me out, I’m gonna call her out. (audience applauding) That’s H-U-N-T. (laughing) Ready for this? “I wish some people would be more mindful of what they say on morning TV. My granddaughter just heard the reference about no Santa Claus. Thanks for opening up that can of worms. (audience laughing) I have changed the channel, perhaps forever, if your guests don’t clean up their act on morning TV.” (audience laughing) (audience applauding) How much fun is that house? Hey, Cathy, maybe your granddaughter should be in school, It’s 10 a.m. (audience laughing) “AM Northwest,” the TV station, responds. (audience laughing) “Hi, Cathy. Please tell your granddaughter that Orny is just mad because he’s on Santa’s naughty list.” (audience laughing) (audience applauding) How old are we? How old are we? Is that shaming? That feels like shaming, by the way. Then they start a hashtag: #CoalForOrny! (audience laughing) Debra C. Taley says, “He’s an idiot!” I’m sorry, T-A-L-E-Y. (audience laughing) “He’s an idiot. Making fun of people with celiac disease is not funny or cool. I wouldn’t pay money to see him.” Then she do',\n",
              "  'es the hashtag #CoalForOrny. (audience laughing) So I gotta put an end to this right away. I gotta, I gotta do what people do when they screw up in the spotlight. I either, either have to go into rehab, and I’m not giving up tequila, or, or write a retraction. So this is what I wrote, and I had to handwrite it in after ’cause they deleted it so fast. (audience laughing) Here’s what I wrote. “Earlier today, I misspoke, and I want to be clear. I know Santa exists, and has celiac disease.” (audience laughing) (audience applauding) #OrnylsJewish. (audience laughing) (audience applauding) I used to hate, by the way, Orny Adams is not my real name. I changed it when I was in college. It was Adam Orenstein. And, by the way, that’s one of the things that, that’s what’s wrong on my Wikipedia page. They misspelled my legal name. But I didn’t, I changed my name because I didn’t like people knowing I was, I was Jewish. It was like, it was weird. Like, people, some people don’t like Jews. I don’t know if you know that. (audience laughing) I always thought, “Well, you know what? Why don’t you hate me first for something else? Then hate me because I’m Jewish.” (audience laughing) When I was younger, people would say anti-Semitic things. They’d come up to me and go, they’d go, “You’re cheap, you’re a Jew, you’re a cheap Jew.” And I said, “I’m seven, I don’t even have money yet.” (audience laughing) (audience applauding) These gluten people. (audience laughing) No, we’ve lost our minds, okay? If we go back to that Portland bit. (audience laughing) People need to just settle down. People need to just settle down. We’re just trying to have a good time. There’s too many people on the planet. That’s what I’m starting to think. And if the Internet has taught us anything, it’s that half this planet needs to be medicated. (audience laughing) (audience applauding) And by that I mean euthanized. I- (audience laughing) Time to get rid of some of these people. I don’t like mean people. I don’t like judgmental people. I don’t like people that don’t let people be people. I don’t like violent people. I don’t like, that’s right. (audience applauding) You know, like these mass shooters. The, wow, you got quiet. Are there, are there any mass shooters here tonight? That was weird, right? This is what I don’t get about mass shooters. And I don’t mean to make light of something really serious, but these people go into movie theaters and they shoot strangers. If you’re that angry at the world, don’t you know people you’d rather kill first? (audience laughing) (audience applauding) Shouldn’t the story be, “And then he invited everybody he ever hated to a movie and he shot ’em”? I’m not even that angry at the world and I have a list of 52 people, 53, 53 people in a… (audience laughing) (audience applauding) We’ve gone nuts. There are seven billion people on the planet. People need to stop having kids. (crowd cheering) How often do you see somebody with a kid and you think, “They shouldn’t have had a kid. (audience laughing) We didn’t need him. Now we got a little version of him.” There are seven billion people on this planet and we’re giving tax breaks to people that have children? How about rewarding the people not overpopulating the planet? (crowd cheering) (audience applauding) I should be able to cut out the UPC code on my condoms, attach it to my 1040. (audience laughing) I want a rebate. You know this wasn’t the plan. You know just 100 years ago, there was just a billion people. God probably took a little nap. Said, “Everything’s fine on Earth. I’m gonna take a little nap.” Wakes up, goes, “What are they doin’ down there? (audience laughing) Seven billion people? They’re sluts. (audience laughing) Give me the book. What did I tell them? ‘Be fruitful and multiply,’ That’s a typo. (audience laughing) I said, ‘Be fruitful and pull out.’ Why did I?” (audience laughing) (audience applauding) We have lost our minds',\n",
              "  '. Do you know now, because of the glutonians, (audience laughing) everything has to have a warning label? 20 years ago, there were no warning labels, right? And we were fine. (audience laughing) (audience applauding) That’s right, we were fine. Sure, a few people died, but we didn’t need those people. Water has a warning label. (crowd cheering) Water has a warning label. Water, water, water, water, water. How much writing is on your faucet? How much writing, first of all, look at all the writing on this bottle of water. Look at it. Look at it. Do, you see it? I don’t like you. Look at the writing on this bottle of water. Look at it, look at this, look at this, look at this! Look at all the writing on this bottle of water. How much writing is on your faucet? Zero. Zero! (audience applauding) They’re so afraid of being sued. Everybody’s suing everybody. I’m suing four people myself right now. (audience laughing) These class action lawsuits, they’re great! You don’t even know you’re suing somebody until you check your mail and there’s a postcard. (audience laughing) “Were you in Best Buy in 2012?” “I guess so.” “Did you buy a flat screen TV?” “I think I did!” “They might owe you money.” “I think they do!” (audience laughing) Where do I sign this important postcard? Then I tell everybody. People are like, “Well, you know, you look exhausted.” I’m like, “Well, I’m suing Best Buy.” (audience laughing) “A lot of stress in my life. We’re going into closing arguments next week.” Water has a warning, Look at all the writing on a bottle of water. “Warning: Do not swallow cap.” (audience laughing) I think we can afford to lose those people, right? (audience laughing) Time to lose some of the cap swallowers. Now we’re down to 6.5 billion. (audience laughing) “Do not refill.” Because maybe some of us will figure out the old stuff tastes a lot like the new stuff. (audience laughing) They’ll put anything on there to protect themselves. Look, “Warning: This was bottled in a factory where there were once peanus, peanuts, ” Did I say penis? Oof, “Warning. (audience laughing) (audience applauding) Warning: This was bottled in a factory, where there were once peanuts. An old, peanut might have fallen into the water. There’s a, there’s a shellfish factory next door. A shellfish might have walked over and dipped its toe in the water. Warning: The guy who bottled this may have had eggs for breakfast. If you’re pregnant, ask your doctor if you can drink water. (audience laughing) May or may not contain water. If you’re still reading this, get help.” (audience laughing) And water has an expiration date. Water can’t expire! (audience applauding) It can evaporate. If you open it up and there’s nothin’ in there, it went bad. (audience laughing) But as long as there’s something in there, nobody’s ever gone, “Shit! It’s sour! Don’t drink the water.” (audience laughing) It sat in a lake for thousands of years. These people put it in a bottle. “You have three months to finish it, then throw it out.” This is the world. It’s gone crazy. Does any of this make sense to you yet? I love the way you smile. It’s just, it’s so effortless. It just pops up. It really does. (laughing) That’s what I call a pre-mortgage smile. (audience laughing) He smiles so easily. Like you and me, it takes, like, a second. Like we go to smile and then the world drags our lips down and, I get nervous every time I go to smile, because when I was a kid, I smiled at a girl and I got nervous and my lip dried and it got stuck on my teeth like, and every time I go to smile, I think that’s gonna happen. I’m like, “It’s gonna get stuck again.” (chuckling) But you’re great, dude, really. I just love how, how much fun you have and how carefree you are and you have, like, a nice, little sparkle in your eye. You probably still have dreams. (audience laughing) (audience applauding) You think these people have dreams anymore? No, we have flashbacks! ',\n",
              "  '(audience applauding) (crowd cheering) We have flashbacks to where it all went wrong. When you’re in your 20s, you think, “I’m not gonna end up like these old people. I’m gonna live forever. I’m never gonna be the guy who wears a Hawaiian shirt all year long.” (audience laughing) That’s my favorite type of guy, where they just get old and they go, “Screw it. I’m goin’ Hawaiian shirt all year long.” (audience laughing) (audience applauding) “Take me to Tommy Bahama’s, give me the whole lineup.” (audience laughing) There’s a lot of ’em. There’s the one back there. Here’s a third one. My God, my audience has turned into a Jimmy Buffett concert. (audience laughing) (audience applauding) I better be nicer to the millennials. (laughing) When you’re young, you want to know why you get thick when you get older? Food becomes the last joy you have left. (audience laughing) When I’m done eating, I’m depressed, because I’m the furthest away from eating again. (audience laughing) You know what I’m sayin’? I just love how excited you are. You look at a guy like this. This is a guy who’s, you’ve been through something. You can just see it on you. Probably divorced, right? Yup. There you go, there you go. (audience laughing) (audience applauding) Kid? Probably have a kid, right? Yup. Yup. That, that kid ruined your face. That’s what happened. (audience laughing) How, how old are you? I’m 55. 55. I thought you were older. (audience laughing) No, no, no, look at me, look at me. Look at me. No wife, no kids. I’m 64 years old. (audience laughing) (audience applauding) People that are married and have kids, they always look down on people like me. They always say, “We, we figured it out, he never figured.” Let me tell what I have that you guys don’t have. Silence! (audience laughing) (audience applauding) I wake up every day, I’m like, “What, what’s that I’m not hearing? What is that?” I look down, everybody’s safe. On with my selfish day. (audience applauding) You didn’t think your life was gonna turn out like this, did you? No. No. No. None of us do. None of us do. That’s what life does to you. But this is what you’re supposed to be. Have the, the arrogance of youth, I love it. You probably have a lot of friends still, right, that you hang out with and laugh and have a good time. Not the old people! (audience laughing) Why do you think they’re here tonight? They have to pay a professional to laugh. (audience laughing) (audience applauding) I just ran into a mic stand on my special. You think my life turned out the way I wanted it to? (audience laughing) I’ve lost all my friends to marriage, kids, sobriety, (audience laughing) gluten allergies. (audience laughing) I’m down to three friends. Two I don’t even like. (audience laughing) One I’m hangin’ on to just in case I need a kidney someday. I’ve got a friend for parts. I called him Kidney once by accident. I was like, “Hey, Kidney, Kenny. Did he, he didn’t hear that, did he?” Is that Kenny? (audience applauding) You’ll see what happens to you. You’ll see. How old are you, Kenny? I’m 29. 29. Yeah, you’re dumb too. (audience laughing) (audience applauding) Life is gonna destroy you. I wake up every day, I think, “Why did I drink last night?” And I didn’t even drink. (audience laughing) I have felt hung over for the last 10 years every single day. When you’re 29, you think, “I’m not gonna end up like these old people. I’m gonna be relevant forever. I’m gonna have the perfect life. I’ll never be in the hole to the IRS or to the bank and I’m gonna marry the perfect girl.” That’s what you think, right? Yeah. “And we’re gonna have perfect kids and, and she would never cheat on me.” (audience laughing) And then life is like, “Get in the hole! Get in the hole, get in the hole.” (audience applauding) (crowd cheering) (crowd cheering) “Get in the hole!” “I’ll never have my mom’s hips.” “Get in the hole!” (audience laughing) We wake up every single day in ',\n",
              "  'a hole. We just wanna be at street level. We just wanna wake up even. Not feel sore, not feel any pain. That’s all we want. Oh my God. (audience laughing) Can I breathe yet? (audience applauding) I like getting older. I really do. You have something to look forward to. Do you know what I mean? It’s nice to see the finish line, it really is. (audience laughing) I almost signed up for the military last year by accident. Anybody else ever do that? Anybody here serve? Thank you for your service! (audience applauding) Yeah, I said it! I said it first! I’m always the first to say it. I like to be first, ’cause then it feels like I get the most credit for it. (audience laughing) I was at the mall and I saw the service people coming at me. I went, “Thank you for your service!” And then as they got closer, I realized it was Girl Scouts in the, in the uniforms, but, better safe than sorry, right? What branch? Army. Army, there you go, thank you, thank you. (audience applauding) How old were you when you went in? 18. That’s amazing, that really is. That takes a lot of courage. As I get older, I realize how much courage it really takes to go in at that age. I didn’t have it. I never even thought about serving, but last year I was in Salt Lake City, Utah. And a guy comes running out of the recruitment center. It was on the other side of a parking lot. He scared me, he goes, “Bro! Wanna join the Army?” I thought, “Who are you talking to?” He goes, “You!” I said, “I haven’t even had my morning coffee yet.” (audience laughing) I can’t do anything before I have coffee. I can’t even make coffee until I’ve had a cup of coffee. (audience applauding) Sometimes I have to make a crappy batch just to get to the good batch. So he said, he goes, “Wanna join the Army?” And he was, he was dressed in those camouflage, fatigue, he scared me, you know? I said, “First of all, I can see you.” (audience laughing) Wouldn’t it help the sales pitch if you were camouflaged like a car bumper or something? (audience laughing) I said, “I’m too old.” He said, “How old are you?” I go, “I’m in my 40s.” He goes, “You look like you’re in your 20s!” I go, “Do I look as dumb as Kenny?” (audience laughing) I never thought about serving, but last year, when that guy said to me, “Do you want to serve?” For the first time in my life, I thought, “Yeah. I do.” And that’s when I realized we’re recruiting the wrong people. Let the young people enjoy their lives. Send people like me over there. I’ve lived long enough. I don’t give a shit anymore. I’m ready to die. (audience applauding) I know what we’re fighting for. I’ve got the fire in my belly. I wanna start the Fighting 40s Brigade! (crowd cheering) I wanna put boots on the ground with ankle supports. (audience laughing) We’ll be the greatest army in the world because we won’t care. Bunch of, we’ll run right at the enemy. Bunch of old guys in our Hawaiian shirts running right, “Shoot me, shoot me first, I’m sick of life.” We’ll have our flip-flops going, “Flip-flop, flip-flop, flip-flop.” They’ll hear us coming a mile away. (audience laughing) My dad just turned 70. We bought him an iPad for his birthday. That is the cruelest thing you can do to an old person. The whole time, he’s going, “Where did it go? Everything moves!” Then my four-year-old nephew waddles over, touches something. “Okay, it’s back.” My four-year-old nephew is tech support for my dad. (audience applauding) The kid’s a genius. He takes my iPhone, I think he’s just touching the screen. He found the App Store. He’s downloading kid apps. He cracked my passcode. It’s a thumbprint! (audience laughing) When are we going thumbprint on everything? ‘Cause these passwords are getting hard, When did websites start judging the quality of our passwords? “Weak!” (audience laughing) “That’s pathetic. You call that a passcode? Come on, get to good. Get to good. Meanwhile, my bank card, the one thing that has all my money is ',\n",
              "  'four numbers. (audience laughing) (audience applauding) But my Hilton Honors Award account has to have a footprint, an exclamation mark, something in Swahili. (audience laughing) God forbid somebody hacks that and gets a free night at the Louisville Hilton on me. (audience laughing) (audience applauding) Have you noticed the older you get, the further back in the pharmacy you go? (audience laughing) When you’re a kid, you don’t even go inside. You’re out front riding that horsey for 50 cents. Next thing you know, you’re up against the back wall with the walker balls and the diabetes socks and pill cases so you know what day of the week it is. I’m sure eventually a wall opens up and they just suck you into an old age home. (audience laughing) It’s probably right next to that chair where you get your blood pressure taken. If the reading’s too high, the chair probably just starts going back. (audience laughing) (audience applauding) Grab a thing of Grape-Nuts on the way out. That’s how you know it’s over. If you’re eating Grape-Nuts, that’s the end of the line. (audience laughing) There’s no hope in that. It’s a, it’s a black-and-white cover with a piece of dead wheat. The prize inside is reading glasses. (audience laughing) Every time I see people in the blood pressure chair, the old people, I think, “Whose bright idea was it to convince old people to sell their homes, move into an RV and drive across the country?” (audience laughing) They’re losing their eyesight and their reflexes. Let’s put ’em in the biggest vehicle they’ve ever been in. (audience laughing) (audience applauding) I see those things coming, I get the hell out of the way. I treat it like an ambulance. I’ll drive up on yards, you know. This is the world, and we’re all the same. We are really all the same. I realized this the other day. I was in Target. You ever go into Target? [All] Yes. Yeah. I love Target. First of all, I’m overwhelmed when I go in there. There’s too many choices for, how many different size Ziploc bags do we need? (audience laughing) There’s an entire aisle. When I was a kid, there was one size. If you didn’t like it, you went like this. (audience laughing) Now they have snack, snack plus, quart, gallon, three-gallon, jumbo, triple jumbo. They have one for the whole house. You put the whole house in a bag and you zip it up. (audience laughing) (audience applauding) Freezer? Freezer, they’ll do anything to sell you more bags. Freezer, don’t put the room temperature ones in the freezer! That’s gonna void the warranty. Every year they come out with a new style. This year they have easy-open flaps. Which means some people couldn’t figure out the zipper! (audience laughing) This, this was too hard for some people. People are writing in: “Make it easier, make it easier!” The Tide detergent aisle. The Tide, first of all, this is what’s wrong with this country. We have scented trash bags? (audience laughing) If your trash smells like trash, take it out. (audience laughing) (audience applauding) Rotten food plus Febreze smells like rotten food plus Febreze. (audience laughing) (audience applauding) There are so many different detergents you can buy now. The aisle, the Tide detergent aisle, there’s a million different scents. There used to be one scent: Original. (audience laughing) Now you got, like, April Fresh. They’re making scents up. Months don’t smell. Nobody’s ever gone, (sniffing) “I smell like November. How do I, how do I get that April Fresh smell?” (audience applauding) I love the people in the Tide detergent aisle, ’cause this, this is everybody. Everybody’s just smelling, everybody. And then when they find the one they like, they put it back and they grab a new one from the back. We are all the same, we are all the same, we are all the same! Everybody is the same! (audience applauding) I went into Target, listen to this. There’s no common sense. We’ve lost our minds. We have gotten so du',\n",
              "  'mb. I saw a guy on a reality show, this is what he said. He goes, “I’m gonna turn my life around 360 degrees.” (audience laughing) You’re gonna be right back where you started, you idiot. You go 180, you stop. You go 360, your life’s gone full circle. Why, why don’t you go 720? Go, go, go 1080, just keep going in, in circles till you pass out from your dumb. I saw a guy on another reality show, he was so drunk, he goes, “I’m so drunk, I’m abbreviated.” Not inebriated, abbreviated. He’s inebriated. His time on TV should be abbreviated. (audience applauding) I mean, we laugh about it, but it’s a serious problem, because the little kids are watching so much TV and you’re picking up secondhand dumb. (audience laughing) I went into Target. I went into Target, ready for this? I went into Target, bought a bunch of stuff, used a coupon, paid with my American Express. The guy goes, “Sir, sir, I need to see your ID.” I go, “What for?” He goes, “Well, you know, to make sure the card isn’t stolen.” I said, “I just used a coupon. (audience laughing) Why would I use a coupon if the card was stolen?” (audience laughing) (audience applauding) You got me there! I’m busted! 15 minutes ago, I mugged a guy. I felt bad, I wanted to save him 75 cents on April Fresh Tide. There’s no common sense. It’s like every year, my cable bill goes up by, like, $100 and I have to call and threaten to leave. (audience laughing) I’m not even nice anymore. I just call ’em up, I go, “Lower the bill.” They go, “Who is this?” I go, “It’s me. Now lower the bill.” (audience laughing) They go, “How do we know? What’s your Social? What’s your street address? What’s your-” I said, “I’m calling to lower the bill. I’m sorry, are people stealing people’s identities, calling up and lowering their cable bills? (audience applauding) Is there some sort of epidemic I don’t know about? Lower my bill! Put that in the notes. ‘If anybody calls to lower Orny’s bill, lower it!’ (audience applauding) “I don’t care if somebody calls by accident. Lower the bill. They don’t have to know my mother’s maiden name, my shoe size, my first pet’s pet, they could call by accident. My next call to you guys will be, ‘Why did my bill go down?’ Some 12-year-old named Hudson called up during recess.” (audience applauding) There’s no common sense. I find myself every day making this face. Every day I just go. (audience laughing) You ever catch someone doing something dumb and you roll your eyes and they don’t catch you rolling your eyes, so now you have to re-roll them even louder? (audience laughing) (audience applauding) “What?” There’s no common sense. I got a ticket ’cause the thieves in Los Angeles are stealing off of our license plates the little registration year sticker. Yes, and you don’t know your sticker’s missing! (audience laughing) ‘Cause you don’t go out to your car every morning and go, “Is my sticker still there?” You don’t know until you get a ticket. So I called the DMV, I said, “Hey, there’s a mix-up. I got a ticket but my car’s registered.” And she says, she goes, “Sir, sir, you need to prove to us that your car is registered.” I said, “I’m sorry, am I talking to the DMV? (audience laughing) (audience applauding) Isn’t that a little piece of information you should have?” She goes, “Sir, it’s policy. You need to send us a copy of your registration.” I said, “I don’t even know where that is!” (audience laughing) She said, “We’d be happy to send you a copy.” (audience laughing) (audience applauding) To send back to us.” This is the sick world that I live in! I didn’t even open up the envelope. I just wrote “Return to sender.” (audience laughing) Every day is a fight, it’s a struggle. My printer broke, I call customer service. By the way, have you noticed when your cable goes out, they don’t try and fix it. The first thing they do is they try and bundle you. (audience laughing) “We notice you don’t have phone service with us. Would you',\n",
              "  ' like phone service with us?” “No, ’cause then I wouldn’t be able to make this phone call right now.” (audience laughing) “Fix my cable, then sell me stuff.” I like when you call up and the first thing you hear is, “Please listen carefully, as our menu options have changed.” If your customers are memorizing your menu options, fix your product. (audience laughing) (audience applauding) My printer broke, I call H-P. The first thing they say, “Is it plugged in?” “Yeah, I, I’m an adult. Did I, did I call the kiddie line? Is this…” The guy got nervous, he goes, “Well, can I ask you, what, what are you using the printer for?” (audience laughing) “I’m using it to iron. Is that the problem? I’m making flapjacks. Sometimes I open the hood, I put the batter in there and then I hit ‘Print’ with my foot. Am I using it wrong? Fix my printer!” (audience applauding) Every day is a fight. Every day is a struggle. I got into a fight with a waitress. I asked her, I go, “What’s good on the menu?” And then she didn’t suggest anything I wanted. So I had to have that discussion with her. (audience laughing) I said, “How’s the burger?” She goes, “I don’t know. I don’t eat meat.” Now she’s gonna turn my meal into a political protest. (audience laughing) She goes, “I’m a vegan.” You know how they say it all judgmental sometimes? “I’m a vegan.” I go, “Well, I’m a me-gan.” (audience laughing) (audience applauding) You know what I told her? “You know why I eat meat? Because we made it to the top of the food chain.” That’s right. The cow had a chance to stand up and learn a language like us. But the cow stayed down! The cow stayed down! (audience applauding) You know why I eat meat? What’s in the word “meat”? Eat. The word is actually “me eat.” It couldn’t be any clearer, unless they added the extra “E.” (audience applauding) Me-e-e-eat. It’s probably how it got its name. One day, a caveman’s chewing on a bison leg. The other one’s like, “What’s that?” “Me eat! Me want, me eat.” (audience laughing) You know what’s in the word “vegan”? Nothing! (audience laughing) It’s probably short for, “Vegetables again?” (audience laughing) (audience applauding) Every day is a fight. That’s why I like doing this. When I’m up here, this is the only part of my day that feels right. This is, this is justice for me. The rest of the day is a fight. It’s a struggle. (audience applauding) People don’t listen to me during regular hours. I say stuff, I get in trouble all the time. People don’t love me the way you guys love me. (crowd cheering) (audience applauding) This is justice. This is ju, I was in Chicago, and a guy came up to me and he said, “Seven years ago, I saw you for the first time and I’ve come back every single year to see you with the woman I met on a blind date that first night. And we now have a three-year-old kid.” (crowd awwing) And in that moment, I realized how little I have gotten done in the last seven years. (audience laughing) (audience applauding) This is justice. I don’t have this in my real life. Dating? My last relationship ended because, well, we were different. I was a morning person and she was nuts. (audience laughing) Complicated. Do I have to say “complicated” now? Do I have to clean it up for the stupid little millennials and say, “She was complicated. She was complicated.” She was nuts! (audience laughing) (audience applauding) I was always in trouble. Listen, I thought I was being romantic one night, ready for this? Everything was “mean.” She was always, “You’re mean. You’re mean.” Even when I wasn’t being mean! Look at her put her arm around him. Do you say that to him all the time? Is he mean? Is he mean? Do you get it all the time? All the time. We’re not even being mean. Are we? I said to her, I go, “Hey, do you mind putting the half-and-half away?” She goes, “You’re mean!” (audience laughing) I didn’t say, “Hey, the half-and-half doesn’t put itself away every day.” I thought that, but',\n",
              "  \" I didn’t say it. (audience laughing) (audience applauding) I thought I was being romantic one night. Ready for this? We’re cuddling, and she’s very petite and beautiful. And I go, “You’re so soft. It’s like cuddling with a marshmallow.” (audience laughing) I know it’s wrong now! (audience laughing) (audience applauding) Dumb me, I thought I was being cute and romantic, you know? Until I got the look. Women, when you do something wrong, you get the look. They just, their neck snaps back like, (audience laughing) They couldn’t be further away from you. I had to start backpedaling. I’m like, “Like, a size-two marshmallow! A stale, size-two marshmallow. A strong, independent stale marshmallow that we have sex on the side marshmallow. I’m a marshmallow! I’m a stupid marshmallow!” (audience applauding) Wanna know the last thing she said to me when we broke up? The last thing as I was getting the keys back to my house. Now, people say things in the heat of the moment. This was bad. She looked at me and she said, “Do you wanna know why you never made it as a comedian? (crowd oohing) Because you’re mean!” (audience laughing) (audience applauding) And I thought, well, thank God she thinks I’m funny ’cause, you know, Mean I can fix. Funny, you kinda gotta be born with that. That would’ve broken my heart if she was like, “You didn’t make it ’cause you’re not funny.” That would’ve devastated me. We’re not that smart, women. If you wanna live a happy life, okay? Take the marshmallow example, okay? If you wanna be happy with him that you think he’s mean sometimes. And you wanna be happy, you wanna be happy, right? It it is so simple. All women have to do to be happy in this lifetime, whatever your expectation of man is, lower it! (audience applauding) (crowd cheering) That’s it! Lower it to the ground! Lower it. Lower your bar. Lower your bar. Lower your bar of men. We can meet ground. We can meet ground. We wake up in the hole every day anyway. We’ll just stay there. We’re not that smart, men. Why do you think our shirts have pockets on the outside? So we know it’s on right. (audience laughing) (audience applauding) I met a guy once, he drove a truck. I was just trying to make conversation. I go, “What do you drive? An F-150?” He goes, “250!” I go, “What’s the difference?” He goes, “100.” That’s my people. That’s my people. That’s my people. Lower the bar. And we’re arrogant! Every time I go out with my married friends, if a beautiful woman walks by, one of them will go, “Man, if I wasn’t married!” If you weren’t married what? (audience laughing) (audience applauding) I knew you when you weren’t married. You weren’t getting that. (audience laughing) That’s why you got married. Are you gonna go not get her number like you used to when you weren’t married? Married men, they like to, they like to look at other women and when they get caught they say things like, “Well, I’m not dead.” Yes, you are. (audience laughing) See, that’s what’s wrong with men. We see virility and living as getting women. Women are more evolved. You want to settle down, right? You want the white picket fence. We see that fence we think, “Shit, I gotta paint that every year.” (audience laughing) (audience applauding) We can’t be what you want us to be. You want that romantic guy. The guy in the movies. The “Every kiss begins with ‘K'” guy. (audience laughing) That guy has ruined more relationships. You wanna know what killed romance? Terrorism. Well, now the guy can’t chase the girl to the airport anymore like in the movies. (audience laughing) (audience applauding) He’s gotta sit outside at the curb texting her. “I’ve decided I love you. You’re the one, but you need to come out ’cause I can’t get past security, (audience laughing) (audience applauding) Damnit, there’s a cop behind me. Okay, I’ve gotta go to the cell phone waiting line. When you come out, text me and I’ll swoop in just like in the movies with the flowe\",\n",
              "  'rs.” We can’t be what you want us to be. You want that romantic guy, the big proposal so you can tell your friends. Girls love to tell their friends about exciting things, right? Every girl, first of all, women are very smart ’cause they work together as a group. (audience laughing) And every girl has a little subgroup. You have a committee. Every girl has a committee. And when she goes out on a date, she comes home, the committee has a lot of questions. (audience laughing) All we have is one friend, he just wants to see a picture. (audience laughing) (audience applauding) No guy has ever come home from a date and his friends are like, “Tell me all about her! What was she like? Does she have any hobbies? Is she close with her family?” No, get to the picture! And does she have any cute friends I can date? They want romance, the proposal. You ever see somebody propose that you don’t know? Isn’t that weird? I was out to eat at a fancy restaurant. Sitting there at the fancy restaurant, having a good time. I’m, you know, sitting there with marshmallow so, (audience laughing) there’s some pressure from her committee. And the guy next to me decides to ruin the night by proposing. (audience laughing) And he couldn’t get the ring out. This stupid F-150 guy didn’t rehearse getting the ring out. It was stuck in his pocket, he’s sweating like I am. He was like, “I have a question!” I’m like, “This guy’s having a seizure!” (audience laughing) All the women knew what was going on because a proposal, they can, (sniffing) (audience applauding) they can smell it from miles away. “It’s a proposal! Somebody’s dream is coming true! Over here! Over here! Come on in! Get the boxes of tissues!” Every guy in the place was like, “I don’t need this shit tonight.” (audience laughing) (audience applauding) So now we all turn to watch the big moment. The guy got on his knee, proposed, and she said “No.” (crowd awwing) It’s the greatest thing I’ve ever seen! (audience applauding) I’ve never been happier. To be that close to somebody’s lowest point in their life? I was like, “Get in the hole! Get in the hole! Get in the hole!” I didn’t think it could get any better and then all of a sudden, the waiter started coming out with a sparkly cake. He had to do a U-turn, he’s like, “Abort the mission! Abort the mission! Abort the mission! Abort the mission!” How did the guy not know? How did the guy not know? How did the guy not know? How did the guy not know? Women let you know when they want something. You don’t tell us outright. You like to play a little game called Hint: You Figure It Out. (audience laughing) And you better figure it out. Like, a woman doesn’t ask to move into your house. No, no, no, no, no. She starts a little pile in the corner. (audience laughing) Then they want a drawer. I picture them sitting around with the committee going, “Did you get a drawer yet? Did you get a drawer yet? Did you take your toothbrush and spike it in the bathroom like we did the flag on the moon? I am here!” Then they take their hairs and they throw ’em all over the place! (audience applauding) “My kitchen, my bathroom, my ceiling!” (audience applauding) (crowd cheering) God created women’s hair so men don’t cheat. (audience laughing) We love you, women. But we can never be what you want us to be. We’re just too simple. We’re not smart. When we meet women, you know what we do? We try and change you overnight. (audience laughing) Women know you can’t change a person, right? That’s right. But you can break ’em. (audience laughing) That’s what they do. They take years. They find a guy that is good enough and they chisel him down. (audience laughing) They chisel, and chisel, and chisel, and chisel, and chisel, and chisel, and chisel, and chisel. (audience applauding) “And don’t wear the Hawaiian shirt to the comedy show!” (audience laughing) (audience applauding) Why do you think guys like mowing the lawn so much? We’d ra',\n",
              "  'ther hear, (imitating lawn mower) than whatever you have to say. It’s the same reason you guys blow dry your hair for so long. It can’t take that long. You probably keep wetting your hair so that you can stay in there. “I can’t take another word from him!” Why do you think that thing is shaped like a gun? (audience laughing) “He won’t shut up!” We love you, women, but we can’t be what you want us to be. We try, we can’t figure you out. You’re too delicate. You guys are like that string of Christmas tree lights where if one of the bulbs is out, the whole operation is down. (audience applauding) You make one mistake, she just shuts down and you don’t know which bulb it is. You have to guess, “Is this the problem? Is this the problem? Is this the problem? Is this the problem? Is this the problem? Is this the problem? Is this the problem? Is this the problem? Is this the problem? Is this? Is this? Is this? Is this? Is this? Is this? Is this? Is this? Is this? Is this? (crowd cheering) And the dumb man is like, “Screw it, I’ll just go buy a new one.” (audience laughing) What I’m trying to tell you women is get married as close to your death as possible. (audience laughing) Men actually get better with age. It’s biological. You wanna know what happens as you get older? All of a sudden, the TV commercials start talking to you. (audience laughing) (audience applauding) Right now, you don’t hear ’em. One day, you’ll be sitting around it’s like, “Are you a male over the age of 40?” (audience laughing) That’s me! What’s going on? Is everything okay? “Do you not have as much energy as you used to have?” No, I’m exhausted! What is it? “Do you still print stuff?” Yes, I do! (audience laughing) (audience applauding) “You might have a treatable condition called ‘low-T’.” Low-T. Low testosterone. They’re making shit up. (audience laughing) This is like gluten and Santa Claus, it doesn’t exist. This is what happens to men as we get older. It’s natural. And they talk about it like it’s a bad thing. Low-T is the greatest thing to happen to men. (audience applauding) Every, every, every, every bad decision I ever made was on high-T. (audience laughing) (audience applauding) Low-T is a blessing. High-T destroys lives. Nothing bothers Low-T Man. I’m driving, somebody flips me off in traffic, Low-T Guy just keeps going. (audience laughing) (audience applauding) I go out on a date, I don’t think she likes me. Great, I’ll get eight hours of sleep tonight. (audience laughing) (audience applauding) You wanna be happy? Lower your bar, we’ll lower our T. Let’s meet halfway, we can do it. (crowd cheering) Thank you. (crowd cheering) (audience applauding) [Crowd] Orny! Orny! Orny! Orny! Orny! Orny! Orny! Orny! Orny! Orny! Orny! Orny! Orny! (crowd cheering) It’s been a long road and I really, I can’t thank everybody enough who’s been here for me. And I thank you so much.

              " ['[“Hard to Kill” by Bleached plays] [audience cheering and applauding] Hello! Denver! [cheering and applause continues] [Patton laughs] Oh my God! Hello. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. [cheering continues] Thank you. Oh my God! Yes! Thank you all so much for coming out tonight. Um… Hey, I broke my foot. Yeah. That’s how I started my year. I broke my foot. Uh… It was… It took two… It happened in two parts. Uh, the second part was I slipped off a curb and I landed wrong. That was the second part. The first and most important part was I turned 53. That is the crucial part. [audience laughs] I… You turn… Once you get past 50, everything’s fatal. I… When I was in my twenties, I would walk into propellers and put some Bactine on it. I was fine. And now if a pine cone falls near me, my spine implodes. I don’t know what… Like that. [audience laughs] Broke my foot, and then the day after… I’m gonna drop a name. All right. Uh, the day after I broke my foot, Glenn Howerton, my friend Glenn Howerton… [audience cheers] …who is almost 50, but for this bit he’s over 50. I needed to… Come on, who cares about logic? He broke his collarbone. So I called him up, gave him a little solidarity, a little support. “Hey, man. I broke my foot.” “What happened?” In my mind, I’m thinking, “Well, he was probably reaching for a bag of SunChips wrong, and his collarbone broke or something.” And he said, “Yeah, I was snowboarding. I landed a flip wrong.” All right. Fuck off. Fuck off. [audience laughing] You don’t need to go to that much hassle. Once you get to a certain age, you don’t need… I don’t even think that’s what happened. I think he’s lying to me. I think… I think somebody slammed a door near him, and then his collarbone fell into his ass cheek. And then he told his wife, “Duct-tape me to a snowboard and push me down a black diamond trail, please.” “Give me some dignity for God’s sake.” [audience laughing] I’m gonna drop another name. A month after I broke my foot, Tony Hawk broke his… [audience cheering] …broke his femur in two. Pow! Landed a vertical wrong. In his warehouse, doing his verticals, landed it wrong. Broke his femur. DMs me a picture of his X-ray. He’s like, “Looks like we’re in the same boat, buddy.” I’m like, “No, we’re fucking not.” You… [audience laughing] You just Jackie-Channed yourself into even more coolness. [audience laughs] He found a whole other level of cool. I slipped off a curb like someone’s aunt that saw a bird. That is how I went down. [audience laughs] I went down in the most embarrassing way possible. [audience chuckling] And the one weird thing that happened, ’cause when I did it I was still in my 23-year-old denial head of, “I just twisted my ankle. I’ll drive home.” I was at work. “I’ll drive home. I’ll be fine.” Driving home, it’s hurting worse. “Oh, this actually might be a real thing.” I get home. I can barely get out of the car now. And I’m limping across the street to my house. And it’s really hurting, and then a car pulls up, these two women are driving, and the driver rolls her window down and says, “You okay?” I’m like, “Oh, I twisted my ankle. I live right here.” “I’m going inside, pu',\n",
              "  't some ice on it.” And then, and this haunts me, she said, “Well, don’t give up.” [audience laughing] Which… Wait. What? Holy shit! What was the look on my face? [audience laughing] What did I… Did she… “He’s gonna kill himself. Pull over. Pull over.” “Hey, don’t give up.” “Let me play this Peter Gabriel, Kate Bush song. This’ll really…” “Let’s listen to this.” Maybe that was just my face left over from the shutdown and the pandemic. Is that how my face permanently is now? Because I didn’t do the shutdown well at all. I did a bad shutdown. I planned a great shutdown. I planned an amazing… Remember when the shutdown happened? Supposed to stay home, and you had that little memory of all the times you said, “If I could just get a month off, I could get my shit together.” [audience laughs] “I could get my life… I just need a month off.” I planned a great shutdown. I executed the worst one ever. Oh my God, the list I made. The list we all made. We all made the same list? Yes, you did. All the great books you were gonna read. All the great books. All the skills you were gonna learn. Oh my God, we couldn’t wait to work on ourselves. If I had actually followed the list that I made, there’d be a different man standing in front of you right now. He’d be 30 pounds lighter. He’d be speaking fluent Italian. [audience laughs] When all of you walked in, there would have been a handmade raspberry almond crumble tart on everyone’s chair, on each chair. I would have hand-milled the flour this morning. [audience laughing] You would have eaten it off of an origami plate. [audience laughs] When you’re done eating, you throw the plate down, it pops up into a frog. Oh my God! Oh, the plans I had! [audience laughing] I didn’t do any of that shit. I ate Doritos for breakfast, and I watched Deadwood twice all the way through. Watched it. Finished it. Back to episode one. Hit play. [audience laughing] That’s all I fucking did. And then I went crazier than a barn full of clown pubes. That is what I did during the shutdown. And listen, when I… When I say, “Crazier than a barn full of clown pubes…” [audience laughing] …I’m not kink-shaming. I’m not judging. [audience laughs] Clowns have as much right to have a varied and experimental, adventurous sex life. I’m saying the source of the crazy isn’t the clown pubes. It’s the having the thought and then the follow-through of “I’m gonna fill this barn…” [audience laughing] “…with the p…” I just want that to be clear. That the source of the crazy is the barn. The barn full of pubes isn’t even the crazy. It was the act of filling the barn… Listen, if you… If you just filled a barn with pubes, you’ve checked off the crazy box. [audience laughing] But this person went, “I’m putting obstructions in my way.” “I will only collect the pub…” Also, how do you… There’s no way to know. Clown pubes don’t look different. Like, they’re not bright orange. They’re not rainbow-colored. Look. Some are, but a lot… There’s a lot of… Listen. There… There’s a lot of non-clown pubes that are bright orange and rainbow-colored. That’s not what I’m saying here. What I’m saying is there’s no way that… Okay, this is what ',\n",
              "  'I’m saying. Wait. Fuck. Okay. If you… Like, okay, if you’re walking around… [audience laughing] …and there’s a barn, and you open those two big doors, there’s a wall of pubes, and you go, “Well, there’s a maniac roaming the countryside.” If someone said, “Those are only clown pubes.” Like, “Oh! We gotta call the National Guard.” Wait a minute. What? ‘Cause there’s no way to prove that. [audience laughing] Oh, okay, wait. You could do this. Every time… Every time that you collect… Not… Not a… Not a clump. That’s gross. Not a clump of… No. [audience laughing] Clump is too gross. Thatch? No. [audience laughs] Thatch is too folksy. That’s… That’s the other… Like, if Cracker Barrel opened a BDSM store, they would call it the Thatch of Pubes. That’s what it would be called. You’d go down to the Th… It’d probably be connected to the Cracker Barrel. You’d go in, get a nice breakfast, then go, “Hang on. I gotta pop into the Thatch of Pubes.” [audience laughs] “Pay the bill. I’ll meet you at the front.” [audience laughing] Thatch of Pu… ♪ Thatch of Pubes ♪ [audience laughs] [laughing] We… ♪ We’ve got nipple clamps And scented lubes ♪ [audience laughs] We’ve got floggers, and paddles, and dildos. Oh my! And a tower of butt plugs that kisses the sky. [audience laughs] Tell ’em Petunia the pube pig sent ya. [audience laughs] Oink. All right. Um… [audience laughs] Handful. Handful of clown pubes. That’s non-gender specific. Every time you collect a handful of clown pubes, you take a Polaroid. You have a Polaroid, so you’re kneeling down. You’re collecting the pubes. You got your baggy. Gotta do it full length. Get the whole clown in there. He or she’s gotta be in their wig, their makeup, holding that day’s newspaper… [audience laughing] …so you know. Then you take a hole-punch, punch a hole through the Polaroid, get a ribbon, put it through that hole, tie the other end of the ribbon to the… the… the handful of pubes, toss it in the barn… Every handful of pubes is accounted for. There you go. And that’s how you would pro… Fuck, no. No, you can’t. You know why? No, that doesn’t work, because then someone can go, “Technically, you didn’t fill the barn with pubes because the ribbon and the Polaroid took up…” No, it has to be complete confidence in the speaker and total trust in the listener. When you say I tho… This is what’s happening right now, okay? We’re starting this set out. Let’s go on a journey for the next hour. I started off pretty strong, I think. I think I’ve won your trust, but you know what? You shouldn’t 100%… No. Not yet though. [audience laughing] Because what you’ve got… Listen. What I’ve done, comedically, creatively, I have opened the barn doors. [audience laughing] And there’s a wall of pubes. [audience laughing] And yes, it’s impressive, but you’re right to go, “You know what?” “I bet that wall of pubes, I bet that’s a half an inch thick.” “And there’s a big sheet of plywood behind, and the rest of the barn is empty.” “I’ve been screwed over too many…” You’re right to think that. What I’m… This is what I’m doing. As a comedian, I’m inviting you… I’m saying I want you to run as hard as you can into this wa',\n",
              "  'll of pubes, and then, I want you to fight your way back, just fight your way to the back of the barn… [audience laughing] …until you’re cocooned in pubes. You know what I mean? At the back. And when your hand hits that back wall, you will think, “I met a man of honor.” That is what you will think. [audience laughing] That is what I want for us. Not me, not you, us. All of us. That’s what I want. Those are the kind of bits I wrote during the shutdown. I’d be awake for eight days in a row… [applause] Five in the morning, “The fucking Polaroid doesn’t even work!” Goddamn it! [audience cheering and applauding] I bought a trampoline. [audience laughs] Not a giant backyard… One of those little workout ones. Yeah. Little tiny trampoline. It’s called a rebounder. Awesome. You get up on it. You hop up and down, get the lymphatic system going, “Here you go. Ooh. Out, in. Forward, back. Ski it out.” Great workout. Got it right at the beginning of the pandemic. “I’m gonna stay fit during this thing, man. I got my new rebounder.” It came out of the box, not a speck of dust on it. Oh, I was so excited. I could feel how excited the rebounder was. You could feel it. He was like, “I’m gonna make a difference in this house.” “I belong here. I’m gonna change things for the better.” I’m like, “That’s right, little rebounder. Wanna go inside the house?” “You wanna go in the gym?” He’s like, “Yeah.” We have a gym in our house. It’s a room with an elliptical in it. We call it a gym. [audience laughs] I take him inside. Oh, he’s so excited. I put him down. “I’ll see you tomorrow, little rebounder.” He goes, “Yeah.” We both looked over at the elliptical. [audience laughs] Against the wall. Clothes hanging off of it. [audience laughs] Covered in dust. And I could feel the rebounder’s heart break. I could feel his… You know what it felt like? It felt like the rookie cop fresh out of the academy. He’s like, “Give me the worst precinct in town. I’ll turn it around!” “I’ve got progressive policing techniques, community outreach.” “I’ll make a difference.” And he shows up that first day, big thermos of green tea, little keto lunch, he’s all excited. Looks over in the corner, “Who’s at his desk?” The old homicide cop. [audience laughs] Eight bullet holes in him. Eleven colostomy bags. [audience laughing] He’s having his seventh Viceroy of the morning. [audience laughing] [Patton exhales] That’s the elliptical. [audience laughing] Looks at the little rookie rebounder, “You’re gonna learn, kid.” [audience laughing] “You think I didn’t have dreams when I came here, huh?” “I was top of the line!” “You can stream movies on me, TV shows, mountain programs, everything!” “Oh! I was gonna turn this house of fatties around.” [audience laughing] “That guy that just dropped you off, he was on me day one.” “Cute little workout outfit.” “Little iPhone. He downloaded a bunch of podcasts on it.” “Ooh, a thinker!” [audience laughing] “He gets up on me, stretch those little fat thighs, pumping them up and down.” [grunting] “Thought he was gonna go the distance.” “He didn’t make it past the first Blue Apron ad.” [inhales, exhales] [audience laughing] “Hopped',\n",
              "  \" off of me.” “Went and checked his texts in the crapper.” [audience laughs] “He never came back.” [audience laughs] “Oh, he’ll be here tomorrow.” “Oh, he’ll be in his little workout outfit.” “He’ll probably put a little playlist on his iPhone.” “Yeah.” “He’s a Gen X-er in his fifties.” “I bet it’ll be all early ’80s New Wave pop.” [audience laughs] “That’s how he’s gonna get thin. Nostalgia.” [audience laughs] “He’ll hop up on you, start jumping up and down like a gibbon full of Skittles.” [audience laughs] “What’ll be the first song he listens to? I can call it right now.” “It’ll be the Go-Go’s ‘Our Lips Are Sealed.'” “That’ll be the first song.” “And you’ll be all excited. ‘Oh, he’s gonna go the full hour'”! “He won’t make it past the bridge.” [audience laughs] “The minute Jane Wiedlin starts singing, “Hush my darling,” he’ll hop off of you, he’ll check his texts in the crapper.” “He’ll never come back.” [audience laughs] “Extinguish all joy within you, and nothing’ll ever hurt you again.” [audience laughs] I just pitched the saddest Pixar movie in the… If they do a movie with the Safdie brothers, that’s gotta be their movie. Harvey Keitel is the elliptical. [audience laughing] Timothée Chalamet is the rebounder. [audience laughing] And Frances McDormand is the half-inflated exercise ball. [audience laughs] Went fucking crazy during the shutdown. My rock-bottom, psychologically, during the shutdown happened on the same day as my wife and daughter’s. We all hit crazy rock-bottom at the same time. Um, it was a weekday. We’re all in the house, staying inside. Doing our part. Stop the spread. My daughter’s in the kitchen, and out of nowhere, she says, “Hey, there’s a weird guy in our backyard.” [audience laughing] What the fuck? I go running out, “What?” Looking out, “I don’t see anybody. You saw someone?” She goes, “Some weird guy just walked across our backyard and went around the back. He’s back there right now.” I’m like, “Oh shit!” We have cameras all over the property. I have an app on my phone. You click it and can look at what the camera sees. I’m waiting for it. I’m gonna go back and confront him. I just wanna know what I’m about to deal with. I don’t know what’s back there. What if it’s a lost hippie wanting someone to hacky-sack with him? “I’ll hacky-sack with you.” [audience laughing] Could be a maniac, nude, with a bucket of chicken on his dick, holding a sword. I don’t know what’s back… I just wanna be ready. [audience laughing] But the cameras aren’t loading, and I’m waiting for it. Goddamn it. And then my wife pushes past us, doesn’t say anything and goes striding across the back lawn. She’s got a white summer dress on flowing in the wind, barefoot. And she’s holding a pink, aluminum baseball bat. [audience laughing] And she has serious Manson girl energy coming off of her, like… [audience laughs] “Look at that hot, hippie chick that I wanna fuck and get murdered by.” “Yay.” [laughing] So, she… It takes me a second to realize what she’s doing, then I go clomping after her, in my flip-flops and cargo pants, but she’s already around the corner and she’s already laying into this guy. Before I can t\",\n",
              "  'urn the corner, I hear her screaming at him, “Who the fuck are you? Get the fuck out of my yard!” “I will fuck you up.” [audience laughing] [audience cheering and applauding] So… I… I turned the corner. She’s in a stance. [audience laughs] Like Uma in Kill Bill, she’s ready to go. [audience laughs] The guy she’s yelling at, little scruffy looking, didn’t look crazy, didn’t look homeless, holding a cell phone, just looked a little off, and she’s screaming and yelling at him, “What the fuck are you doing here?” Now I’m gonna stop the story and tell you what was actually happening. There was something wrong with our air conditioner. I… [audience laughing] I called our contractor and said, “Can you send someone to the house to fix the AC?” Without telling us, he gave this guy our address and gate code and sent him to the house. So yes, massive misunderstanding. My wife is now screaming at him, and she’s just fucking… Just blazing Valkyrie, shrieking at the top of her lungs at this guy, “Who the fuck are you?” Now, to his discredit… [audience laughing] …when there is a blazing-eyed Valkyrie holding a vagina-colored piece of metal… [audience laughing] …threatening to kill you, answer in short, declarative sentences. [audience laughing] [applause] This guy… This guy was going, “Who’s anybody really, man? Like…” “Every day was… Oh, the wheel in the sky…” Oh, goddamn it. Now she’s got both hands on the bat. She’s gonna swing on the guy. And then he looks at me. And when he looks at me, that’s when he gets scared. [audience laughs] He started saying, “My name is Michael. Your guy Steve sent me here to figure…” And my wife’s like, “Oh my God, he didn’t tell us. I’m so sorry.” “Oh my God, I’m gonna call him right now.” “I’m… This was… This really got off on the wrong foot.” “How about you leave…” The guy was more than happy to leave. [audience laughs] I’m sure he was driving home going, “That poor bastard. Oh my God.” “I’m sure the sex is amazing but…” Um… [audience laughing] A lot of you hear the story and go, “That’s not very manly of you.” “You let your wife… God knows what could’ve happened!” I argue the opposite. [audience laughs] I say that our timing and placement made us a more effective home invasion deterrent. [audience laughs] ‘Cause remember he never got scared when she was screaming at him? He just kept going, “I…” You know why? He couldn’t process what he was seeing. [audience laughs] Gorgeous Valkyrie, vagina-colored metal, screaming. Too much. Too fucking much. Couldn’t process it. And also, again, the energy she’s giving off is outer-space sex vixen about to murder you. [audience laughing] Can’t process it. You know what he could process? Me. Standing five feet behind her, ’cause the energy I was giving off was, “I can’t do nothing when she gets like this.” “I… I tried to get her to go to the nervous hospital, see?” “She said she’d burn the house down.” “She’s killed so many Amazon delivery drivers.” “I can’t dig no more holes in the desert. Please just run!” [audience laughing] I’m doing some poses that we can freeze for the Netflix save screen. A little… [audience laughing] [cheering and applause] [Pat',\n",
              "  'ton chuckles] [audience laughing] There’s gotta be… What if I did… What if I use… Here’s what I’m gonna do. Watch. Like this. [audience laughing and cheering] Now, look. That’s… That’s not a bit in the special, but if you’re watching Netflix, and that “coming up next,” you’re like, “Let’s watch a minute of that.” Like, “What the fuck is this?” [audience laughing] [Patton chuckling] I’m vaxxed and boosted. Yes, I am. Thank you. It shouldn’t… [cheering and applause] Thank you. But… That… Look. Thank you. It’s also sad that gets applause at this point, isn’t it? You get applause for taking the most basic care of your health? That’s like me going, “Folks, I wipe after I shit. Thank…” No. No, no. [cheering and applause] People. No. I’m no… I’m no hero now. It’s the lumberjacks who cut down the trees that make the toilet… Those are the heroes. [audience laughing] [man] Yeah! [chuckles] I assume there’s a lumberjack here. All right, um… [audience laughs] [Patton chuckles] Or a really enthusiastic wiper. Um… [audience laughing] I got my vax right when the vax came out. Immediately. I didn’t jump the line. I didn’t use my privilege, but… I acted on some inside information, and I feel bad about this. This is how I did it. Uh… Right when the vaccine came out, I have a friend, lives out in Riverside. And he calls me and says, “I don’t know if I should tell you this, but, uh, out where I’m living, it’s MAGA country.” “No one is getting the vaccine.” “There’s a Rite Aid near me, a woman sitting at a table.” “Everyone that walks in she asks if they want it. No one will get it.” “They’re throwing crates of this shit out the back.” “If you drive out here, you will get a shot.” “Don’t even make an appointment.” So I drove out there. I walk in. There’s a woman at a table. I go, “Hi, excuse me. I’d like to get a vaccine.” She was like, “You would?” Like, she had no… [audience laughing] She had run out of Tolkien novels to read. Like, “Yeah. Let me get you set up.” Like, “Go stand over there.” While I’m waiting, my friend was right, everyone that walked in, “Would you like a vaccine?” “No, thank you.” And one guy gave her a, uh… “[scoffs] Yeah, no thanks.” [audience laughs] Like, “Yeah, nice try, Deep State. I think I’m gonna, uh…” “I think I’m gonna stay tracker-free for the time being if that’s all right.” “Hang on. Yeah. I’m at the Rite Aid again. Yeah.” “They tried to get a fucking track… Hang on. I’m losing you.” “There you are. Yeah, no. I’m off the grid, man. That’s…” “Right. I’ll call you later.” Got my shot. Got my second shot, then boosted twice. I’m fucking fine. In 1955, the polio vaccine came out. 1955. We were two years away from satellites. There were no satellites! And America could not have been more backward, racist, homophobic, sexist, and these non-satellite-having, racist dipshits lined the fuck up to get their fucking vaccine! [cheering and applause] What the fuck! [cheering and applause continues] “Give me that shot. I can’t police these water fountains from a wheelchair.” [audience laughing] “I can’t beat up queers inside an iron lung! Give me my science!” “What am I, a caveman?” [audience laughing] Now it',\n",
              "  '’s the year 2022, which, first off, doesn’t sound like a real year, does it? [audience laughs] Doesn’t that sound made up? Like you’re watching a cheap science-fiction film, “In the year 2022…” “Oh, you’re just throwing numbers together. Jesus!” “Who wrote this shit?” [audience laughs] It’s 2022. We have robots on Mars. They send us TikTok videos. [audience laughing] Half of the country’s like, “That needle’s got witch poison in it, I tells ya.” “You ain’t putting no witch poison in me.” [audience laughing] [chuckles] “Keep your wizard jab away from me.” “I got to watch the video that the Mars robot sent to the world brain I keep it in my pocket.” [audience laughing] “But keep all that science away from me.” If that attitude had existed in 1955, the government would have had to do one of those PSAs, like a little cartoon dancing, hypodermic needle coming out, you know. [audience laughing] “Who do I gotta blow to cure polio?” Like little… [audience laughing] [cheering and applause] Yes. That’s right, jabby. Tell everyone about your benefits. [audience laughs] “My benefits? Your fucking legs work. How’s that for a benefit?” [audience laughs] “You medieval shitheads.” [audience laughing] It’s a different world now, man. It’s a different world. Isn’t it? Cruise ships? Oh, you’ll never see a cruise ship again. Kiss that goodbye. Our grandkids won’t know what a buffet is. Oh. [audience laughs] Fuck, Covid changed everything. First off, every cruise ship is booked up to the year 2026. People cannot wait to get aboard the plague barge and sail the bounding main. “Oh, let me die near a water slide!” [audience laughing] Not only are buffets gonna come back, they’re gonna come back with this weird, own-the-libs vengeance. Every one of them’s gonna have an agenda. “Come on down to Captain Covid’s Alpha Males Only buffet!” [audience laughing] “You the kind of left-wing soy boy that needs a sneeze guard over your clam chowder, or are you able to fuck your wife?” “Then come on down to Captain Covid’s…” [audience laughing] “You show us proof you ain’t been vaccinated, you get a free platter of room-temperature scallops.” [audience laughing] “That’s right.” [chuckles] Oh… I was listening to ’70s on 7 on the way here. Yeah, on my XM Sirius satellite dial. You like ’70s music? You hit number seven. All the ’70s music you can have, ’70s on 7. You like ’80s music? You hit number eight. [audience laughs] ’80s on 8. Do you like ’90s music? Guess what you hit. Number nine! [audience laughing] Do you like ’40s music? Well, you don’t hit number four. You used to, ’40s on 4. Now, channel 71. ’40s Junction. You like ’50s music? Well, it’s channel 72. ’50s Gold. You like ’60s music? Seventy-three, ’60s Gold. Why did those three channels get moved to the outer rim of the XM Sirius universe? I will tell you why. Their listeners are dying. [audience laughing] ’40s, ’50s, ’60s. Those listeners are dropping like… The fucking ’40s channel has five listeners left. [audience laughing] Three World War II veterans and a couple of contrarian hipsters. That’s it. That’s all that’s left. “You know who’s punk rock? Artie Shaw.” Fuck off. [audience lau',\n",
              "  'ghing] And we can laugh and enjoy it, but hey, during our lifetimes, ’70s, ’80s, ’90s will go marching up the dial. That’s how you can track how the generations are dying, by where they’re putting the stations. [audience laughing] Keep the ’70s, ’80s, ’90s easy. I hope when they do that, that they take a little time and give some consideration to the names the way they did for the ’40s channel, ’40s Junction, train station, evocative. I get it. Picture in my head. And then they just gave up. ’50s Gold, ’60s… Ah, who care… What? You couldn’t do “Poodle Skirts and Milkshakes”? You couldn’t do “Patchouli Oil and Love Beads,” or whatever? [audience laughing] Give the ’70s channel a name emblematic of the decade. You know, “Your Mother and I Are Separating Radio.” How about that? That’s good. Sure. [audience laughing] Yeah. “Giant Candles Everywhere For Some Reason Tunes.” [audience laughing] The ’80s could be “Trapper Keeper Tunes.” [audience cheering and applauding] And then the ’90s channel could just be… [groans] [audience laughing] [groaning] I don’t know… That was Abra Moore’s “Four-Leaf Clover” on… [groans] [audience laughing] [groans] [audience laughing] Hi. Do you live here in Denver, ma’am? I live in Colorado Springs. [Patton] You live in Colorado Springs? Nice. Thank you for making the drive. [woman] No problem. Okay. What do you… [laughing] Okay, glad I got that straight. It wasn’t a problem. Thank God. Okay. Guys, it wasn’t a problem. It’s cool. [audience laughing] [Patton chuckles] Do you work in Colorado Springs? What do you do? I’m a doctor. [Patton] You’re a doctor. Oh my God, a brainiac. All right, um… What kind of medicine do you practice? I’m a pediatric neurologist. Pediatric neurologist. Oh my God! [audience cheering] You’re like… [cheering and applause] You are serving your community. You are helping children. You have a positive job that you have a positive attitude towards. This is comedy death. I need to get off of you right now. There’s nothing here. [audience laughing] I need to talk to a meth cook or a divorcee. This is… [audience laughs] “I help children live.” [sliding beep] All right. Shit. [audience laughing] Is this, uh… Are you with her? You guys together? Is this the hubby? The husband. The husband. What do you do, sir? I’m a lawyer. [Patton] You’re a lawyer? Ah… [audience laughing] [kisses] Finally. [audience laughing] Some evil. [audience laughing and applauding] Oh God, if it’s some kind of positive community outreach law, I’m gonna fucking… What kind of law do you practice, sir? I prosecute juvenile sex crimes. You prosecute juvenile sex offenders. Well… [audience laughing] When you say juvenile sex offenders, do you mean people who commit sex offenses against juveniles, or juveniles who are sex offenders? Juveniles who are sex offenders. Juveniles who are sex offenders. Gotta be very careful with the phrasing. And when you say… And then what happens? Like, they get… Why am I…? What is this, a…? I gotta… Me sitting down was good for that one laugh. I’m not gonna do the rest of my show like, “So what do you do?” [audience laughing] What the hell am I doing? [applause] You are',\n",
              "  ' prosecuting the juvenile sex offenders. Okay. And you are a neurological pediatrician. So a kid whose brain maybe isn’t working correctly, you help fix it. And the ones you can’t fix, he puts away, right? Is that how… [audience laughing] There we go. [audience laughing] There’s your next Marvel team-up. All right. So… [laughs] [audience laughing] That was cute and dark at the same time. Rare to find that. It’s like a goth girl holding a kitten. All right. [audience laughing] How about you? Do you live here in Denver? [man] I do. You do? What do you do in Denver? Uh, I work in a bar and I’m a student. You work in a bar and you’re a student. Oh, it’s a 1980s Tom Hanks movie. All right. So… [audience laughing] What are you studying right now? Uh, cybersecurity. Cybersecurity. And then, by day, he patrols the Internet. At night, it’s Slippery Nipples for secretaries, right? [audience laughing] What, uh… So you’re a bartender, and so do you want to eventually work in cybersecurity? Obviously. [man] Yeah. And the bartending’s paying the bills. Paying for you to learn. What is the… What’s the scariest thing you’ve learned so far in terms of cybersecurity? How close are we to some huge hack attack where suddenly the ATMs don’t work and all of our porn searches are on the internet? When does that happen? [audience laughs] Um… Pretty much nothing is private. [Patton] Pretty much nothing is private. Well, we all know that at this point. That’s not… Oh my God, have you ever… Okay, when you were growing up, was there, like, some asshole that bullied you or was really shitty, and now that you’re learning your cybersecurity skills, you could go digging into this person’s life and just dis-fucking-mantle it if you wanted to? [audience laughing] Has that temptation ever crossed your head? Pretty frequently. Have you… Oh! Have you done searches of old bullies’ names and stuff like that? I’ve… I’ve chosen not to. You’ve chosen not to. [audience laughs] That is a very lawyerly response. That was… Did you catch that? [audience laughing] Oh, man. Is this the wife or girlfriend? Uh, yes. [Patton] Which one? [laughter] Girlfriend. [Patton] Girlfriend! Oh! And what do you do? I’m an educator. [Patton] You’re an educator. And what do you… Thank you. [cheering and applause] Wow. What, uh… What do you… What areas do you educate in? I help high schoolers, um, access free college credit. Help high schoolers access free college credit. Does the… That’s cool. Does the, um… Does the sleeve tattoo help break the ice when they’re like, “She’s cool”? “She’s all right.” Yep. That must help. [woman] It does, yeah. Do you go in with the sleeve tattoo visible? Or do they make you wear a long sleeve? I bust it all out. [Patton] You bust it all out, sit there… “Let’s get you some fucking credit while you look at The Gashlycrumb Tinies right there, man. There you go.” You got some ink too. How long you been going out? Three years. Four. Three or four years. Three or four years. [audience laughing] Mmm. Some cybersecurity, if you know what I’m saying. Ah, come on, people. Um… [audience laughing] Are you… Do you live together? Oh, nice! Are you gonna… ',\n",
              "  'She looks awesome in… And then he can get you, like, free credit card shit and everything. I mean, come on. [audience laughs] It’s a match made in heaven. Make it happen. Couldn’t he use his cybersecurity to get kids free college credit? Change their grades, get them into Harvard. There’s another fucking team-up. All right. [audience cheering and applauding] I have two superhero teams in the front row. Oh, hello sir. [audience laughing] Shorts in the front row. Ballsy. [audience laughing] That’s it. You have way more self-confidence than I will ever have. Do you live here in Denver? I do. [Patton] And what do you do in Denver? I work in Boulder, actually. You work in Boulder. Live in Denver, work in Boulder. What do you do in Boulder? I work for a grocery store. You work for a grocery store. With that facial hair? They’re cool with that or…? [laughter] What… I’m not gonna ask what grocery store. That’s weird. [man] I bet you can figure it out. Probably could. Hang on. What is your specific job at the grocery store? I’m a manager. You’re a manager at the grocery store. Do you manage the whole store or one department? Um… Yeah. [audience laughing] Yeah, part of it. Yeah. Part of it. The liquor section? What part do you, um…? [audience laughing] You seem amazed at hearing that you’re working at a grocery store coming out of you. “I work at a grocery store! I…” [audience laughing] [Patton chuckling] And, uh, who are you here with? Is this your friend? There’s your friend. And where do you work? Uh, I work from home. You work from home. [man] In sales. In sales. I sell light bulbs. [Patton] You sell light bulbs. Are you asking me? You seem to be like, “I sell light…” You’re answering my questions like I’m a homicide cop. You’re like, “I-I sell light bulbs?” Like, it’s not… [audience laughing] You sell light bulbs from your home. I’m a lighting salesman. You’re a lighting salesman, so you stay in your house. You call people up or get on the internet with them? On the internet. On the internet. And you try to sell them light bulbs. Absolutely. Individuals or corporations? Both. [Patton] Both. That’s so fucking weird. [audience laughs] I just… I don’t know how… So you get on Zoom calls with them, and go, “Really quick, turn on all your lights.” [audience laughing] “It’s pretty shitty, huh?” “Well, I’ve got a solution for you.” [laughing] [audience laughing] You’re not far. That’s so fucking interesting. Okay. You two are delightful, and you are not a superhero team. I’m sorry. [audience laughs] That is… I don’t know what the hell you are. There’s a guy who works at a Trader… Doesn’t quite know what he does there. Another guy gets on Zoom calls and sells light bulbs. I think you have a weird OnlyFans. You’re just covering for it now. You don’t really sell light bulbs. [man] It’s the DC Universe. Oh, DC Universe. Very… Oh… I’ll do the nerd shit, my friend. All right. [audience laughing] Don’t you dare! [audience laughing] That was a fun front row. Give them a round of applause. Thank you, guys. Wow. [cheering and applause] I love the flow of that. You know, doctor, lawyer, cybersecurity, educator, sort of groceries, li',\n",
              "  'ght bulbs, I guess. I don’t know. [groans] [audience laughing] Perfectly paced. [kisses] [audience laughing] [sighs] You know what doesn’t age well? Woke. [audience laughs] It really doesn’t. I’m woke, I think. But you know what? I won’t be someday, and so will all of you. [audience laughs] Be woke. Be open-minded. Just don’t pat yourself on the back, ’cause it’ll bite you in the ass. Everyone getting cancelled now for not being woke was woke about something, they just couldn’t keep up with progress. Progress will always fucking steamroller you. I’m very pro-trans, very pro-gay marriage, gay rights, and pro-abor… No, no, no. No. No. [cheering and applause] That’s not… What I’m saying is that is going to blow up in my face someday. I’ll be doing comedy when I’m 70, and I will let slip something that I won’t be able to keep up with. I’ll be like, “I don’t think people should fuck their clones.” “Boo!” There’ll be some weird, like… [audience laughing] “No wait, I’m pro-trans.” “Fuck you, clone hater!” [audience laughing] “No, I’m totally progressive!” #Stopclonehate, then I gotta… Then I’ll double down. “When I grew up, you didn’t jerk off in a test tube and fuck whatever came out of it! If that makes me the bad guy, I’m sorry!” [audience laughing] “Boo!” [Patton chuckles] By the way, that’s how you know if you’re a… uh, if you’re an oppressed minority, or, you know, a fringe group that used to be shit on, and now you know that you’ve made it when straight, white people start asking you if jokes are okay. That’s when you know… The trans community really broke through because all of a sudden, straight, white people’ll be like, “Is this okay?” “Does this joke work? Is that okay?” You know. But either way, that means in the future, straight, white people are gonna be the minority, then they’re gonna have assholes like, “Hey, I’m doing a joke about a straight, white dude, and, um, I have him bowling. Is that okay? You guys bowl, right? Like that’s…” [audience laughing] “It’s not offensive?” “He’s listening to Limp Bizkit, ‘ironically, ‘ okay?” [audience laughing] “It’s ironic. I’m doing it ironically.” [Patton chuckles] Goddamn, these last six years. Holy shit. I was in such a panic in 2016, then all the subsequent years, “What the hell’s going on? Oh my God. Is America coming to an end?” No. You know what? It isn’t. It’s bad right now, but everything that’s happening is supposed to be happening right now. Do you know what 2016 was? It was the boomers’ last temper tantrum. [audience cheering] That’s what that was. [cheering and applause] The boomers’ last temper tantrum. Every time a generation gets old, they panic because death is scary and gross, and they put someone shitty in the White House before they go. This has happened before. The greatest generation… The greatest generation, oh my God, fought the Nazis, saved the world from tyranny, came back, built the suburbs, raised the baby boomers, then they started getting old. Hair turned gray, dick didn’t work anymore, hemorrhoids and hysterectomies. They panicked. Now it’s the late ’70s. Punk music, they don’t know what’s going on. “Fuck this.” “Put the old cowboy',\n",
              "  ' movie actor in the White House. Yeah, fuck you!” “I was here, goddamn it!” [applause] Then the baby boomers grew up. Think of the baby boomers. They were on the cutting edge of sex, rock and roll, rebellion… They owned youth, and then they got fucking old. [audience laughing] And their hair got gray, and their dick stopped working, hemorrhoids and hysterectomies, fucking Gen X and Gen Z making fun of them on Twitter and TikTok. All this hip-hop music they don’t understand. Now they’re, “Oh my God, I’m about to die. What the fuck is going on?” “Put the racist game show host in the White House. Yeah, fuck you!” “I was here!” [laughter and applause] I’m Gen X. Well, our temper tantrum is going to be beyond ugly. [audience laughing] When we start getting old, our dicks stop working, our hair goes gray, God knows who we’re gonna put in the White House. It’s gonna be either Eddie Vedder or Janeane Garofalo. One of those two. I don’t know. [cheering and applause] Look. I love those guys. Janeane would be a horrible president. [audience laughs] I’ve known her since the ’90s. I love her. She would tell you that herself. Janeane, you should be president. “I’m not doing that shit.” Oh my God, wait a minute. That’s how she’ll win. [audience laughs] Think of how Gen X thinks. Like, “That’s exactly the attitude we need.” [audience laughs] That’s perfect. “No, I’m serious. I’m not doing it.” Yeah, we know, yes. [audience laughing] She’ll blow off a debate. She won’t campaign. She won’t show up to her own inauguration. Yes, that’ll be awesome. We’ll love her even more. CNN will have a ticker on the bottom of the screen, like, “Day 312 of the president not showing up.” [audience laughing] It’ll cut to her in some coffee shop. “I told you I wasn’t gonna run.” [audience laughing] And then we’ll die, and we won’t be here to see what Gen Z puts in the White House. President Logan Paul. I don’t… Look. I don’t know. [audience groaning] President Joe Rogan. [audience groaning] He would… People, listen to me. I’ve also… I’ve known Joe since the ’90s. He is a sweet guy. He has gone off the rails. You know why? ‘Cause someone gave him a hundred million dollars. [audience laughs] That would drive anybody… He’s actually handling it better than I would. [audience laughs] If I had a fucking podcast about knitting and someone gave me a hundred million, I would fuck yarn on my podcast! [audience laughing] And Joe would be like, “Patton went fucking nuts. Oh my God.” [Patton chuckles] Aging isn’t bad if you don’t take it personally. That’s the key, you know. Treat it like it’s a… Pretend you’re Jeff Goldblum in The Fly, and you’re watching all this weird shit happen. You’re like, “Oh my!” Get a leather-bound notebook. Take notes, you know, late at night, like… “Oh. My farts smell like old books.” “That’s… Hmm.” [audience laughing] “But I’m not eating old books. This…” “This calls for further examination.” [audience laughing] “Day 17. Takes longer to stop peeing than it does to pee.” [audience laughing] It’s coming for all of us. I’m gonna leave you with this story about my, uh… Another breakdown that I had. Foot, all of it, it’s all coming a',\n",
              "  'part. But you know what? We’re living in the 21st century and it’s okay. Always keep that in mind. Last year, last November, I had to have some minor surgery, right? And I’m gonna tell you the story. I’m gonna use a little AP English zhoosh to keep it from being horrifying, ’cause it is. I had to have some minor surgery, the kind of surgery that, um, I’ll put it this way, men my age who sit down a lot have to have. See where I’m going? So… And I’m worried. Still Covid. “Oh my God, what if I get an infection?” But I forgot I live in the 21st century. I have all these advantages in the plus column. On the day of the operation, I summoned a car with my phone. The car came. The guy was masked. I was masked. Car was clean, took me to the hospital. Doctor met me, showed me all the cleanliness protocols they had. He said, “This surgery, we’ve refined it.” “It only takes an hour. You’ll be out for an hour.” “You’ll go home today.” He put me under. I wake up an hour later. Oh my God, I’m fine. He goes, “You are fine.” “Here are some cutting-edge painkillers to help you with your recovery.” “You won’t feel a thing.” “Now take out your phone and summon another car.” “You live in the 21st century.” And I did, and the car took me home. And when I got home, I had a device onto which I could call, from the air, movies, books, television shows, music to entertain me while I recovered. Twenty-first century. When I left the hospital, the doctor said, “There’s a certain bodily function, that you’re used to doing every day.” “And for the next few days, you’re not gonna do it.” [audience laughs] “And then, after three or four days, all of a sudden, you will do it.” [audience laughing] “But the first time you do it, it will be doing you.” [audience laughing] “There’s no shame in it.” “It’s gonna happen, part of the recovery.” “Go heal in peace.” I go home. First day, I watch movies. I read books on my iPad. I go to sleep. Nothing happens. Next day, watch movies, read books on my iPad, go to sleep. Nothing happens. Third day, watch movies, read books on my iPad, go to sleep. 3:30 in the morning. [audience laughing] It happens. But I wake up as it’s happening and I can feel it coming. I’m half a second ahead of it. Oh my goodness, it’s not gonna be a disaster. I hop out of bed. Everything’s okay. I make it across the bedroom floor. I get into the bathroom. I’m ten feet away from the toilet. I’m gonna make it. [sings suspenseful melody] Boom! No. [audience laughing] I had managed to get my underwear and sweatpants off. [audience laughing] Which made things ten times worse. [audience laughing] Because now, our pristine white-tile bathroom… [audience laughing] …was decorated for autumn. How about that, huh? Yeah. [audience laughing] Happy Thanksgiving. So… [audience laughing] I’m standing there going, “Oh my God, I’ve got two choices. I can either clean myself off, or risk my wife coming in and seeing this disaster, which she doesn’t deserve.” So, I do the second choice. I clean up everything first. I get a bunch of towels. I get everything all cleaned up in a big, gross wad. I gotta take off all my clothes, including my shirt. I’d rui',\n",
              "  'ned my shirt. [audience laughing] Physics. So… [audience laughing] Take the whole wad down to the… And I’m nude now. Go down to the kitchen with this big wad of horror, take the bag out of the can, put this in the bag. Now, four in the morning, I gotta walk to the end of my driveway where the trash cans are. Get the thing open. Drop it. And I just stand there. [audience laughing] Nude. [audience laughing] 4:00 in the morning. And I just looked at the moon. [audience laughing] Like, hours ago, I was in the 21st century… [audience laughing] …with access to cutting-edge technology, medicine, transportation. And now, just a mere couple of hours later, I had been revealed as the naked ape I always was. [audience laughing] [applause] [cheering and applause] The naked, shit-covered ape that’s inside all of us. And I actually had a weird moment of peace, ’cause it was so awful, and I’m just like, “You know what? I’m actually as far away from the 21st century as I could possibly be right now.” “I’m actually closer to my Neanderthal forebears.” “There’s something weirdly cleansing about this.” And I had that feeling for, like, ten seconds. That’s when I remembered all my neighbors have ring cameras on their doors. [audience laughing] So everybody got their Christmas card that year. Thank you so much, Denver!

Reflecting on his journey, he humorously acknowledges the necessity to leave hard drugs behind. His routine includes comical anecdotes about ketamine escapades and inventing a fictitious Italian sleep aid called “Melatone,” as well as recounting awkward moments like being high at Aretha Franklin’s funeral. Davidson doesn’t shy away from critiquing Apple’s rental service and openly discusses his mother’s midlife crisis and his futile efforts to nudge her back into the dating world. Davidson’s comedic style, marked by self-mockery and bursts of unfiltered truthfulness, ventures into both contentious and darker subjects with ease. He openly discusses his battles with drugs, the challenges of fame, and mental health issues. The special is a blend of humor and poignant reflection, showcasing Davidson’s unique ability to intertwine the complexities of adulthood, fame, and personal evolution. * * * Transcript [flicking lighter] [announcer speaking indistinctly behind doors] [audience cheering in distance] [announcer] Ladies and gentlemen, get ready for Pete Davidson! [door opens] [audience cheering loudly] [door closes] [Pete] I just, uh… I just turned 30 this week, so yeah. [audience cheering] No, it’s over, dude. It’s over. I just, uh… I had to stop doing hard drugs ’cause you can’t… can’t be a drug addict in your thirties. I’m not that guy. You know that guy that can just do one bump of coke? He’s like, “Oh, I’m so bad!” [audience laughs] Or that guy who’ll have two beers, like, “I might have diarrhea tomorrow.” You’re like, “Fuck you, dude, you fuckin’…” Doing drugs in your twenties is fine. There’s an excuse. You’re like, “I’m finding myself.” You know? It’s cute, you know? Do a little bump off an iPad with your friends? It’s adorable. Say cute things like, “I’m a crispy little dolphin.” You know? All your boys are like… [makes dolphin sounds] You know? Then one of your boys has a kid, and you’re holding it, you’re like, “I think I’m a drug addict. I think I need some help.” I was on a magical drug for the last two-and-a-half, three years, called ketamine. It was amazing. What a time! [audience howls] I thought of amazing ideas, great ideas. Like, uh, an Italian sleep aid called [in heavy Italian accent] Melatone. Sorry. [audience laughs] [chuckles] Sorry. So dumb. You go to sleep right away with [in heavy Italian accent] Melatone. Sorry. No prescription. Some guy just gives it to you under a bridge and kisses you on the cheek. [audience laughs] [in heavy Italian accent] “Take one when you hit the turnpike. Alright, hey.” Sorry. If you don’t know ketamine, you probably did it accidentally if you’re a coke head. Yeah. You’ll be doing coke all night. You’ll do one bump, and be like, “Whoa.” “This is not cocaine.” “Also, am I gay?” [audience laughs] It’s embarrassing when you’re not on ketamine anymor',\n",
              "  'e. You’re like, “Ooh.” “Ugh!” “I’m embarrassed. I was out and about like that. That’s not cool.” You know? I was at funerals like that. That’s fucked up, right? I was at Aretha Franklin’s funeral like that. Yeah, I have to live with that. She’ll never know, but still, it’s not the point. If she was there, she’d probably be like, “Hey! Who are you and what the fuck are you doing at my funeral?” It’s embarrassing. I was so high I thought it was a good idea to say to her family, “Hey, I’m just here to pay my R-E-S-P-E-C-Ts.” [audience laughs] Yes. I started renting movies on Apple. Fuck Apple and their rental service! Scumbags! They’re like the mafia, those fucking assholes. They’re such assholes as a company. Did I buy the new phone? Of course, but… fuck them! They’re like the mob. Like, “You’re not getting our new phone? Okay.” “Guess whose phone’s at 43% forever. Fuck you.” “Every day of your life is now a guess, my friend.” “You just buy your new dream car? Save up?” Oh, great. Charger port’s different. Yeah. Every time you get a blow job now, you gotta be like, “Sorry, they got a new charger. Sorry about that.” “Yeah, I know. Apple! I know.” Sorry. Scumbags! You ever go to rent a movie on Apple, and it’s $4.99 to buy and $3.99 to rent? And you’re like, “Fuck you, dude!” Really? You’re going to make me own Jeepers Creepers 2? You fucking assholes! I don’t know. My mom’s having a midlife crisis. Uh, yeah, she’s really far up my ass right now. You know, she’s 55. She hasn’t been with anybody since my dad died. So it’s been like 23 years since she’s, you know, spread ’em, I guess. I don’t know. She called me, having a midlife crisis. She was like, “I want to get a facelift.” I was like, “For what? You don’t even use your face.” [audience laughs] I’d get it if she was out getting tagged or something. You know, what you getting a facelift for? To watch Grey’s Anatomy? [audience laughs] [in high-pitched voice] “I love Eric Dane.” Yeah, my mom won’t fucking date. I’m trying to get her to date. She was like, “Your father was my man.” You know? [woman] Aw. No! It… “Aw” at first. It’s been 20 years of this fuckin’ Nicholas Sparks bullshit. I’m tired of it. I’m tired of it! She needs to get out there. Okay? She needs to sign up to Hinge or fucking Bumble. Whatever the fucking… The one the ladies get to choose. Whatever. Girls are so cute. They’re like, “It’s cool! We get to choose who comes on our face.” Anyway, um… [audience laughs] “Ain’t that nice?” She needs to get out there ’cause all that weird energy that’s supposed to be on a cock goes to me and my sister, okay? And it’s fucking weird. I’ll go over to my mom’s. I’ll hang out, eat dinner for an hour, and she’s like, “Where you going?” I’m like, “Home. What do you mean?” Unless we’re about to fuck in the shower, I don’t… My duties as a son are done. [audience laughs] It’s to the point where I might fuck her just to get her off my back. [audience laughs] Yeah, that’s right. “Maybe you’re just not as good of a son as you think you are, huh?” I’m the fucking son of the century right here! Give me my ribbon! If I f',\n",
              "  'uck my mom over Thanksgiving, my grandpa would kiss my forehead, and go, “I heard what you did for your mother. You’re a good son.” “She’s smiling finally, hey.” She needs to get out there. I’m trying to find her a suitor. Someone to fuck my mom, that’s a difficult thing. You want it to be good but you want the guy to be good. And that’s… You know, that’s a rarity. You want the type of guy that fucks her missionary-only. But still makes her come twice, rolls over. Hands her the remote, goes, “Heard Dancing with the Stars is on.” You know, that guy. Where is that guy? My mom’s a good catch. 55, hasn’t been with anyone in 23 years. It’s like fucking brand-new down there. Refurbished iPhone, right? You know? Screen cracks. “Should I get a new one?” “No, send it to this weird company called Insureon.” In three weeks, you get it back, and when you charge it, it’s all weird, but it gets the job done pretty much. That’s my mom’s pussy, dude! Fifty-five, hasn’t been with anyone in 23 years. Brand-new down there. She’s like a classic car. She’s like a ’68 Mustang with like 2,000 original miles on it. All original interior. You go to the dealer, get behind the wheel, like, “Where the fuck’s this been hiding?” “It’s brand-new in here! What’s its story?” Then the guy’s like, “Well, some old guy had it and died.” “And his son kept it in the garage for 23 years.” “But better make a move fast.” “I hear the son’s thinking of keeping it for himself.” [audience laughs] “Hey, I like the way she drives.” “This thing is priceless to me.” My mom was a single mom, you know. But all moms are single moms, you know, right? You know you’re alone, right? My mom was so tired all the time. And now that I look back, horny apparently. “Horny and tired.” So, like, I-I-I never wanted to tell her any of my troubles, because she had no time for anything. And any time I told her a problem, she always had one solution. She’d be like, “You should take a nap.” No matter the severity of the situation. That’s the type of person my mom is. In complete denial. Both my wrists could be cut, and I could be holding a knife. Like, [in screeching voice] “I don’t wanna be here!” She’d be like, “Have you slept today? You look tired.” She’s that type of mom, you know. And I remember I had a huge problem when I was ten. I thought I was gay, you know. I was wrong, but I thought, at ten, because I was obsessed with Leonardo DiCaprio, I was in love. Yes. I was into girls too, but I’m from Staten Island. In 2002, no girl was hotter than Leonardo DiCaprio in Staten Island. What a piece of ass he was, oh my God. He still gets pussy today based off what he looked like in 2002. He is the GOAT. I hope he never gets married. Running the best catch and release program the universe has ever seen. Leave him alone. I hope one day I get invited to the big yacht in the sky. With Tobey Maguire and sometimes Emile Hirsch, you know. “Matching Dodger hats, chicks half our age, guts going.” He don’t give a fuck. Leonardo DiCaprio don’t give a fuck. He’s all schleppy. He’s not even in shape. He’s all fucking fat, slowly morphing in',\n",
              "  'to Jack Nicholson. He don’t give a shit. Walking around on his yacht, looking at babes. Going, “Hey, uhh, I still fuck.” “Uhh!” “Uhh! I still fuck. Uhh!” “I make one movie so good every three years, I just get to fuck. Uhh!” “The ice caps are melting. Uhh!” So when I was ten, I was on my porch all gay, thinking about this guy. Fresh off of a double-VHS of Titanic. “Spit in my mouth, Jack,” I would say. [audience laughs] “Let’s fog up a Model T together.” My dream is to be Fabrizio. [audience laughs] You know, that’s my dream in real life. ‘Cause Fabrizio was Leonardo’s best friend and then he died. That’s my dream, dude. [audience laughs] [chuckles] So I remember I was sitting on my porch, you know, and I was like, “How am I going to tell my mom I’m gay?” You know what I mean? My mom’s an Irish Catholic Staten Island mom. She didn’t tell me I was Jewish till I was 25, and that’s because I found out. I did a 23andMe or ancestry, whatever. One of my boys did it. He came back Neanderthal. And he was talking all this weird Neanderthal shit. He was like, “I’m Neanderthal, actually the rarest fucking…” [mumbles] I was like, “You’re sill a dork. You’re still a fucking stupid dork.” But he was talking all this shit, I was like, “I got to get swabbed. Maybe I’m Neanderthal or something.” And it came back, I was like 50% Jewish. And I called my mom, ’cause I was raised Catholic and… [mimics chanting] All that forever. You know. I was like, “Mom, am I Jewish?” She was like, “Yeah.” [audience laughs] So how am I going to tell her I’m gay? So I was sitting on my porch all gay. My mom pulls up, right? Slams the car door. She looks at me, goes, “What’s wrong?” I go “Nothing.” She says, “No, what’s wrong?” I guess she noticed I looked a little gay. I go, “I think I’m gay.” She goes, “Are you tired?” And I go, “No, I’m just… I don’t think sleeping fixes homosexuality.” Imagine if it did? Imagine if gays are just tired. Elton John must be exhausted. [audience laughs] She goes, “Why do you think you’re gay?” I go, “‘Cause of Leonardo DiCaprio.” She goes, “That’s not gay.” I go, “It is. I have posters of him in my room.” Like Titanic and the beach. Not even the movie The Beach, just him on the beach. With Tobey, you know? Matching Dodger hats, you know? She goes, “That’s not gay.” “Yes, it is.” Right there, that was too long of a problem for my mom. She just snaps. She just goes, “All right! You wanna know if you’re gay, Peter?” I’m like, “Whoa, what the fuck is this, a circus all of a sudden?” “Step right up! My son the queer!” I was like… [audience laughs] I’m like “Relax, we have neighbors. They’re starting to gather.” She goes, “This is how you know you’re gay. Let me ask you this.” “Do you want to suck his dick?” I don’t know what that means. I’m ten. I just don’t answer. She goes, “Do you want to suck his dick?” And I just keep going… ’cause I don’t know what that is. She goes, “Pull his pants down, grab his dick, you know, put it in your mouth till it expands.” I was like, “What? Expands? What the fuck are you talking about?” I’m ten! I got a baby button cock at the tim',\n",
              "  'e. ♪ Baby button cock Little weird boy cock ♪ [audience laughs] It expands? What the fuck you talking about? She goes, “Do you wanna get fucked from behind, Peter?” “By Leonardo DiCaprio?” “Do you want to look behind you and Leonardo DiCaprio’s behind you, puts his dick in your butthole, it expands?” I was like, “You gotta stop with the expansion thing.” I’m ten, it’s 2002. Only expansion I’m aware of, Houston Texans are now in the NFL. That is it! I don’t know about cock expansion, Mom. She goes, “You get fucked from behind by Leonardo.” “And he’s going to town, and he mushes your face in the pillow.” “You’re down there for 20 seconds, and then you look up, and all of a sudden, Leonardo’s outside the window waving at you.” “You’re confused, ’cause you’re still getting fucked from behind.” “And then you look behind you, and it’s Tobey Maguire! Tobey Maguire!” “Is that what you want?” I was like, “Sounds like you need a nap, and that’s what you want, psychopath.” I just said, “No!” And she goes, “Not gay.” [audience laughs] This is going to sound weird. I don’t like doing Make-A-Wishes. Um… [audience laughs] Just ’cause they’re sad, that’s all. By the way, not getting a lot of offers, might add. Believe it or not, it’s not a lot of people’s dying wish to meet me. It’s usually their wish for me to die, actually. Complete opposite. There’s a foundation for that. I don’t like doing them ’cause they’re sad, that’s all. They make me really sad, especially when you’re in a k-hole. When you’re on ketamine, and they say, “This kid is sick.” You’re like, “I know.” “And I’m pretty sure I could cure him.” [audience laughs] “Listen to Alan Watts and put on The Last Dragon. Let’s go.” Sorry. They’re just sad, that’s all. The Make-A-Wish Foundation called, “We got one for you!” I was like, “That’s a weird way to go about it.” Right? I don’t know the right one, but… Not like, “Hey, we caught one! Real sicko! A real sick one.” “That’s what we do.” They call me, “His name’s Kevin, he’s dying of cancer.” I said, “That’s so sad. I’m sorry.” They’re like, “His dying wish is to meet you.” I said, “Is it brain cancer?” [audience laughs] So I set it up. They ask, “Do you want to do this?” I was like, “Yeah, I just drove into a house, I could use good press.” [audience laughs] In my defense, that house cut me off, all right? That fucking… Just fucking… They didn’t put that in the article. So I’m nervous, because I’m not a good Make-a-Wish guy candidate. If there was a Make-a-Wish video game, I wouldn’t be a character you could select. Like, “Pete Davidson!” You know? It wouldn’t be me. You know who’s good at that? Johnny Depp. Johnny Depp comes in dressed as Captain Jack Sparrow. He’s like, “Hello, children.” [mumbles] And the kids are laughing, and the nurses are wet. It’s fucking awesome. They’re fucking all, like, soaked. He’s good, you know? Or John Cena, the wrestler. He’s amazing. I think he’s done the most ever. God bless him. He comes in. He has, like, a championship belt. He’s all wrestlery. He’s like, “What’s up, son? How you doing, champ?” The kid’s like, “Oh!” And then ',\n",
              "  'he’s like, “Wanna hold my belt?” “Huh? Wanna hold my belt?” I’m watching, like, “I don’t have a belt. What am I going to do? I got nothing.” Give him my phone and say, “Scroll to the right”? “Want to see some ass, dude? Fuck yeah.” “Yeah, she’s cool, dude.” “She’s actually your doctor.” Anyway… [audience laughs] So I was all nervous, you know, ’cause I want to show up for this kid. I want to kill it, you know. The Make-A-Wish, not actually… That would be easier. Wouldn’t that be great? You get murdered by your favorite celeb. “It’s been great. Yep.” Bang! [audience laughs] So I was thinking, “What’s my belt?” I want to crush this. This is a huge deal. I want to do well. And I was like, “Ooh.” I was like, “Okay, let’s think about it.” The kid is going to die, right? That’s… No, I’m not being a dick. That’s just what a Make-A-Wish is. That’s all. Otherwise, why would you hang out with a kid for three hours? That’s weird, you know. You’d be a pedophile, actually. Ironically, for a pedophile, that would be their Make-a-Wish, you know? Hang out with a dying, weak one, you know? [audience laughs] Yeah, I don’t give a fuck. I was molested, so I can make those jokes. I don’t give a shit, so there you go. [audience cheers] I’m not saying that to be cool. I just don’t have the Internet. I don’t do interviews. I don’t wanna be like, “Well, actually…” [audience laughs] I was like, “This kid’s gonna die, there’s nothing I can do.” Right? But what I could do, I could tell him all of my secrets. Right? I have a lot of secrets. I don’t kiss and tell ’cause I’m an old-school broad. I keep it to the chest, and I hope God gets you. That’s how I roll. I have a lot of secrets, things I can’t tell my friends or my therapist, ’cause I don’t trust them, you know. And I’m pretty sure one of them works for the Daily Mail. [audience laughs] But I was like, “I can tell this kid ’cause it’s not going anywhere.” It’s like a sure thing. Very few things in life are sure. It’s kinda nice, you know. So that’s what I did. I hung out with him for three hours, sung like a canary. Told him everything. “This guy’s actually cool, this guy’s not.” “This guy’s in the Illuminati, this guy needs to be burned to come.” One of those is me, and I won’t tell you which one. We had an amazing time. He was so happy. I was so happy. A huge weight was lifted off of me too. I got to tell him some stuff, get some stuff off my chest. It was great, beautiful. He hugged me. He said, “That was so much fun. I’ll see you around.” I was like, “Well, I don’t know about that, but… you know…” I was like, “Godspeed, little man, you know.” How cool was that? Hit him with a “Godspeed.” Huh? How often do you get to do that in life? I remember driving home, like, “Godspeed, you motherfucker. That’s pretty cool.” “What are you, Magnum PI? That was awesome.” And I felt great. And then a week went by, and I went on the Make-A-Wish website, and the kid was still alive. [audience laughs] [audience laughs] Started getting a little nervous. I don’t know who this kid knows. So I called up the foundation, check up on him, you know. Ma',\n",
              "  'ke sure no miracles are afoot. [audience laughs] Hey, I held up my end! I was promised a dead child! [audience laughs] I’m tired of people lying to me! So I call up the fucking Make-A-Liars. I go, “Hey, you fucking lying sacks of shit.” They go, “Who is this?” I go, “It’s Pete Davidson.” They go, “Kevin was just telling us what a wonderful time he had.” I go, “I had a great time too.” “He said you really shared a lot.” I go, “Oh fuck, did he?” I guess a pinky promise means dick to Kevin. I go, “How’s he doing?” They go, “Well, not well, but there’s always hope.” I go. “Yeah, well, how much? How much hope do you think? ‘Cause if cancer don’t get him, I will, at this point. He knows too much. They go “We appreciate your concern.” I go, “Oh, I’m very, very concerned.” “You let me know when it happens.” They go, “We will.” Hung up. Next week, I was freaking out a little bit. Just looking at the phone. And then, you know, finally. Yeah. [audience laughs] They called, you know, and, uh, yeah. Wish fulfilled. [audience laughs] Joke over, he dies. That’s it. There is no happy ending. It is a happy ending, in that it’s exactly what was supposed to happen. I was watching Chappelle specials, and I noticed… Yeah, he’s the best. I noticed when he’s crushing and having a good time, he’ll be like, “Aah!” That actually hurt a little bit. Chappelle got some thick legs doing that. I was like, “I wish I had one of those things, where I’m crushing, and I get to…” Whatever that… Maybe when I’m doing well, I-I-I-I’ll go like this. “Wish fulfilled.” [audience laughs] Maybe… Maybe I’ll carry around packing peanuts in my pocket, and after a punchline, I’ll be like… [audience laughs] It’s been a very sad year. I lost my stalker. I think that’s sad, you know? You really don’t know what you got till it’s gone. [audience laughs] You know, I remember when I first met my stalker. She was outside my house. It’s weird when you get a stalker, ’cause there’s two parts of your brain. First time you get a stalker, you’re like, “Oh my God, this is so weird and scary.” But there’s the other part of your brain, “I guess I’m doing well.” [giggles] Then you get a good look at your stalker, and you’re like, “Maybe not so well, huh?” I’ll never forget. I met her. She was outside my house, wearing a shirt with my face on it. And it wasn’t even a flattering photo. It was like blown up and warped. My eyes were all over. It was like a nightmare. It was so… It insulted me. It was so bad. I wanted to go up to her and be like, “Hey.” “If you’re ever going to do this, like, here’s five photos of myself that I like, okay?” So, you know, I pull up, she’s out there. She’s a stalker, so, you know. Not hot, you know? That’s what you picture when you picture a stalker. Not hot. If they were hot, they wouldn’t be a stalker, they’d be my girlfriend. So… yeah. “How much do you love me? We’ll figure it out. Get up there.” So I’m outside, right? And I pull up, and she’s there. And I don’t have a gun, right? But she doesn’t know that, right? So I was watching a lot of SVU at the time, and when they’re approaching the pe',\n",
              "  'rp, they get out of the car, they show their gun, and they usually put it in their jacket like this, and they walk to let ’em know they got one, but not to alarm people. And I didn’t have a gun, but she don’t fucking know that, right? So I made a finger gun, and I put it in my pocket like this. And I started walking towards her, okay? So I’m looking at her like this. And she’s kind of smiling at me. She’s kinda… I was like, “Why is she smiling?” Then I was like, “Oh. She thinks I have a boner.” Okay, yeah. This is like her Make-A-Wish. This is… And I literally went, “Not a boner, just a finger gun,” which I think is worse. I should have just had a boner, to be honest with you. ‘Cause now I’m a loser in front of my own stalker, and I’m… Now she’s winning. Now I’m bothering her in a weird way. So, I go, “What are you doing here?” And I don’t know where to look ’cause I’m on her shirt, and I’m all over the place. And she’s… I’m a little scared to talk to her, so I’m just, like, confused. I said, “What are you doing here?” And she just said, “I love you!” You know. I was like, “That’s very nice, but you can’t be here.” And she goes, “Why?” I was like, “I don’t know, it’s never gotten this far, to be honest.” Usually you go, “Get the fuck out.” People say, “Sorry!” I didn’t expect someone to challenge. I was like, “I don’t know, you just can’t be here.” And she was like, “Why?” I was like… I don’t… I don’t know where to go. I was trying to think what to say, and then I was thinking about it. She seemed a little nuts, you know? You know, I… I’m crazy. So crazy people could, you know… Like, we can tell. She’s definitely a little nuts. She’s, you know… First of all, look at the shirt, you know. You know. And she’s stalking me, you know what I mean? That’s… So I felt a little bad. I was like, “You got to be nice and careful with the situation,” right? So I told her. I was like… I kind of went elementary school on her. I went like, “Hey.” I was like, “You can’t be here because this is where I go poopy.” [audience laughs] And after I said that, a little light flickered in her eye, like she was a Who from Whoville. She was… She was like, “What?” I said, “Yeah, I go poopy here.” She goes, “Ugh.” “You wouldn’t want to be here while I’m doing that.” And she goes, “No!” I got a little embarrassed. I was like, “Why? You’d be so lucky.” “You’d be so lucky if you were around my poopy.” She said “What?” I was like, “Never mind. Yeah, you shouldn’t come here.” “I could be pooping and that’s gross.” “And I have Crohn’s, so it could be a war zone up there.” And she was like, “Okay, I’m sorry. I won’t ever come back here.” Then she left. Right? I thought the problem was solved. No, that is just our first encounter. Okay? It’s a very long story, so buckle in. Also, I do have Crohn’s. I told people I had Crohn’s when I was like 19, 20, ’cause I had it really bad, and then now it’s mostly fine, like, 90% of the time. Uh, but like, I… It’s weird. I don’t like telling people that, like, ’cause I got good meds ’cause things are going all right, so I’m doing okay… But the reason why I th',\n",
              "  'ought… that’s a gross thing to say, but I have to say it because people come up to me outside, and try to bond with me over Crohn’s. And it’s just like… Not even at the bathroom, you know what I mean? I’ll just be in line at a store, and someone’ll come up to me and be like, “Hey!” “Me too.” [audience laughs] And I’m like “What?” And they just go, “Yeah.” “I got a poopy butthole as well.” “Name’s Phil.” I’m like, “Ugh! Fuck it.” I don’t have the heart to say, “I don’t have your Crohn’s.” I’m like the Magic Johnson of Crohn’s. Okay, so… I go out of town, right? My mom and my mom’s 79-year-old friend Terry are watching my house. Terry is a girl. My mom told me I have to tell people that Terry is a girl after a show once. She was like, “Terry could also be a guy’s name, and we love Terry, and if this comes out, and people start…” “We don’t want anyone to think she’s a guy so you should say that she’s a girl.” And I said, “Hey, Mom.” “Nobody gives a fuck about you or Terry.” [audience laughs] So my mom and my mom’s 79-year-old female friend Terry are watching… Yeah, now the joke’s gonna work! They’re watching my house, okay? My mom is oblivious to reality. She’s a very smart lady, but she’s just… She’s one of those moms that’s always like, “Really? No!” Just doesn’t believe anything. I told her. I said, “Someone knows where we live.” “Someone could come over and hurt you.” And she goes, “No. No, they’re looking for you.” “They’re not gonna… They’re not gonna hurt me.” I’m like, “That’s fair, but could you humor me? This is scary.” And I was like, “There’s someone… I have a stalker.” “And you just gotta be aware in case she comes by.” She goes, “All right. What does she look like?” I was like, “You’ll know. Trust me. Unmistakable. Okay?” So I go out of town. Okay, stalker comes back, she rings the doorbell. My mom answers and goes, [high-pitched voice] “Hey, who are you?” That’s what my mom sounds like, by the way. Like an Adam Sandler Hubie Halloween character. [in high-pitched voice] “How you doing?” So fellas, imagine that while you’re tagging it. [in high-pitched voice] “Ooh!” She’ll probably say things like, “Ooh, thank you! Thank you!” She’s been out the game so long, she don’t know dirty… “Thanks, sir!” So my mom goes, “Hey, who are you?” Stalker goes, “I’m Pete’s friend.” My mom, of course, goes, “Well, come on in.” [audience laughs] Stalker proceeds to watch Grey’s Anatomy with my mom and Terry for three hours. Three hours goes by, my mom finally thinks, “Maybe I should call Peter.” “See if he’s coming by to hang out with his friend.” She calls me, goes, “Hey, where are you?” I go, “London.” She goes, “Oh, well, your friend’s here.” I go, “Is she hot?” And my mom goes, [in high-pitched voice] “Eh…” And I go, “You’re under attack!” [audience laughs] “Run for your fucking life!” I go, “Very important. Go to the garage and call the cops.” “But pretend like nothing’s wrong, okay?” Now, I hope none of this ever happens to any of you, but I did get to hear my mom act on the phone. Which is priceless for me. My mom is always like, “Put me in your stuff.” I was',\n",
              "  ' like, “All right, make it to the garage.” You make it… You make it to the garage, you get an audition or something, yeah. My mom goes to the garage, I go, “Call my boy.” Don’t know if anybody has a boy like this. A friend you’ve been friends with for a decade. You do drugs almost every day together, then you don’t see him for three months, then the next time you see him, he’s just a cop. [audience laughs] And you’re like, “Tasty?” He’s like, “Uh-huh! Officer Tasty now.” You know? Better change your name in my phone to Officer Tasty. So Tasty goes over. I’m on speakerphone now with Tasty, my mom, and my stalker. Female Terry fled, okay? [audience laughs] Tasty goes, “We got her. What do you want me to do?” I was like, “You’re the cop.” He goes, “I have her in handcuffs.” I go, “Very good. That’s good.” He goes, uh, “She’s holding a present.” I go, “Okay.” I was like, “Open it.” He goes “What?” I go, “Open it.” He goes, “Why?” I go, “It’s a present.” What do you mean? She’s a stalker. She probably knows me pretty good, you know. Probably a good gift. I dunno. I get a lot of shitty gifts. She might… He goes, “Bro, it could be a bomb!” I go, “Dude, she can’t make a bomb.” “She can’t even make a t-shirt. You think she’s gonna fucking… put a bomb together, dude?” He goes, “All right.” I’m on speakerphone. I just hear this… [mimics scraping sound] And then my boy just goes, “Oh!” “No!” “Bro!” “This is disturbing!” Which is a very big word for Tasty. He’s never pulled the three syllables before. [audience laughs] I go, “What is it?” He goes, “Bro, it’s 20 pairs of soiled underwear.” [audience laughs] Fuck you! No one’s ever done that for you. Don’t talk about my girl like that. Only I can. You wish your girl gave you 20 pairs of dookie drawers. Yeah. It’s fucking thoughtful. I called my girl, like, “You gotta step it up!” “You never even met female Terry.” [audience laughs] Twenty pairs? Yes, it’s gross, but it’s thoughtful. One pair is gross. One pair is a hit. That’s a fuck you. “Here’s my shit.” You know what I mean? Twenty pairs is a crime of passion. [audience laughs] Yeah, it’s crazy, but then again so is love. I have Crohn’s. Maybe she was trying to communicate through some weird fecal matter thing. I don’t know, she’s bonkers. Twenty pairs? That’s thoughtful. That takes time. You can’t knock out 20 pairs of doody drawers in one day. Even if you had diarrhea, by the 11th pair, it’d be a little light. [audience laughs] I like to think it was a day at a time. I do, every night. I like to think about it. I like to picture, you know? She comes home from a long day of eating Hot Pockets on an Acer computer, right? She runs upstairs, you know. She starts undressing, you know, in front of the wall of Pete. It’s all posters of me, but she don’t know how to make posters, so I’m all just… [audience laughs] …everywhere. She puts on a sexy song. Well, sexy to her. So like “Mambo No. 5” or some shit. [chuckles] She starts the séance, lights a candle, blows it out with a fart, you know, gets it going. She looks up at me. I’m looking at her somewhere. And she plants ’em. ',\n",
              "  '♪ One, two, three-four-five ♪ [audience laughs] [hums Lou Bega’s “Mambo No. 5”] [makes a loud farting noise] ♪ …gin and juice But I really don’t wanna… ♪ [makes loud farting noises] She fucking gives a noogie, gets a good fucking… And then she fucking, “Kobe!” Right into a little box for me. She goes, “Oooh!” [in high-pitched voice] “Nineteen to go, poopy surprise for Petey! Woo-hoo!” It’s my fantasy, and I’ll jerk off to it if I want to! [audience laughs] Tasty goes, “What do you want me to do?” I go, “Get rid of her!” “Keep one of those pairs.” Sorry. So now I got to get a restraining order, so that means I have to go to court. Tell a bunch of, you know, officials I’m afraid of this lady. So I’m at court, about to go in, Tasty comes back to me. He goes, “I just spoke to your girlfriend.” I go, “Fuck you!” You know? “What did she say?” You know? [audience laughs] He goes, “She’s not going to be able to be here today.” “She’s going to be on the iPad.” And I go, “What the fuck? What do you mean she won’t be here?” She’s a stalker, her job is to show up. What do you mean? Is she trying to get in my head or something? ‘Cause it’s working. It’s… I’m a little sad. You know, ’cause that… that dookie surprise was thoughtful. Though gross, you know. So I was a little excited to see her, a little bit, you know. I didn’t try to look hot or anything, but I picked an outfit. You know, yeah. Hell yeah! You know? An outfit that said, like, “Hey.” “Don’t give up.” You know? [audience laughs] “Some things are worth fighting for.” Restraining order, shmestraining shorder. I go, “What happened, Tasty?” “What happened to my girl?” He goes, “Bro, she was deemed unfit to stand trial.” Deemed unfit to stand up at a trial. That means a bunch of medical professionals and officers of the law saw her and were like, “No.” I immediately felt insulted. It’s a little fucked up and embarrassing for me, don’t you think? “Deemed unfit”? I don’t think you understand how insane that is. Let me put it in perspective for you. Jeffrey Dahmer was deemed fit… [audience laughs] …to stand trial. A guy who murdered and ate gay people. One chick is into me, off to the nuthouse! [audience laughs] Are you fucking kidding me? That’s ridiculous. Killing and eating gays and poopy pants aren’t the same! First time in my life I was like, “I gotta vote!” [audience laughs] “System is corrupt.” Tasty goes, “There’s one more thing. She said you guys had been communicating.” I go, “Dude, I swear…” He goes, “Telepathically.” I was like, “Whew!” [exhales] Thought they found my burner. He goes, “Telepathically, you know.” “She said that you actually told her to come over with your mind.” I go, “Whoa, that’s fucked up.” And then he left, and I was alone, and I was a little sad, and I was in my cool outfit. I just had a moment of honesty, and I was just like… “Hello.” [audience laughs] “I miss you.” [chuckles] “You weren’t supposed to tell anybody that we could do this.” “Also you were supposed to kill Terry and my mom so we get the house.” “I got your panties in my pocket.” “Ziploc’ed to preserve the stench.” [laugh',\n",
              "  's] So I go to trial, I win, you know, which is nice. I never win in life. [chuckles] Judge comes up to me, and he goes, “She fits the requirements for prison.” I go, “What?” He goes, “Do you want to send her to prison?” I go, “No, I just want her off my lawn.” Like Gran Torino, you know? “Get off my lawn!” [mumbles] But no big deal. Just… restraining order, you know? But restrain her to the upper deck, so she can still pay for shit. You know what I mean? Come to shows. He goes, “You don’t want her arrested?” I go, “No.” He goes, “That’s very noble of you.” I went, “Thank you, sir.” And then he goes, “We will do plan B then.” And he just smacks the hammer, and everybody’s… I was like, “Whoa, wait. What’s plan B?” He goes, “It’s nothing.” “We’re gonna sentence her to like six months, in a mental rehab facility.” I was like, “What? That’s not safe.” “That’s like the one place I’d bump into her.” [audience laughs] Might as well sentence her to Dave & Buster’s while you’re at it. Rehab’s like Cheers for me. It’s where everybody knows my name. A month went by, I got the restraining order. Didn’t really hit me till the first time I pulled up to my house, and no one was there. And I went, “Oh.” I was reminiscing with my mom. I was like, “Remember she’d be out there.” “Remember?” “Remember for Christmas once, she sent us all those cookies, and we made female Terry eat them first… [audience laughs] …to make sure they were good?” So I started missing her a little bit, you know. So once in a while, I’d be like, “Hello. Where are you?” And she wasn’t receiving my signals. So I made a finsta, and I started stalking her a little bit. I found her. She’s doing well. Seems to be for the best. You know, and I was scrolling through. You know, ’cause she’s a stalker, you don’t just stop stalking, right? You pick someone else, I assume, right? I was going through her Instagram, and I found out she’s a Jack Harlow fan now. And I like Jack, but that, that fucking hurt. That’s a fucking kick in the dick. I was like, “If you become a Matt Rife fan, I’ll kill myself.” I swear to God. [audience laughs] So I was watching it, I came across this video of her outside of a Jack Harlow show. Okay? And, uh, Jack Harlow comes out and she… I see her, I zoom in, and she’s wearing a Jack Harlow T-shirt. I guess she figured out how to do it ’cause he looked good in the photo. And I was like, “Oh…” “Oh. I was just practice.” Jack comes out, she goes, “I love you, Jack!” I went… [exhales] Even worse, Jack goes, “Hey, I love you, too.” Says her name. I went, “Oh…” “I bet that meant so much to her.” [exhales] I was calling her “the thing”. [audience laughs] I didn’t know. I didn’t know. Feel like I’m gonna throw up, watching this. Jack’s about to get in his vehicle to leave. She goes, “Hold on, Jack, I got a present for you.” I was like, “Oh, my God.” [chuckles] Got my… Guys, I felt like I was about to watch my girlfriend get fucked by my best friend. I was like, “No! No!” She goes into her backpack. And her arm gets deeper and deeper. I was like, “No, oh my God. What is it?” And then she pulls out a',\n",
              "  'n envelope. Hands it to Jack, goes, “I made that for you.” He goes, “Thanks so much.” Puts it in his jacket, drives off, video over, I log out. I start smiling to myself. Just an envelope, huh? [audience laughs] Ha! You can’t fit 20 pairs of dookie drawers in an envelope! Couple of legal disclaimers. So, she actually didn’t send me 20 pairs of underwear. She sent me two, but it smelled like 20, okay? She also did not become a Jack Harlow fan. I just made that up for hilarity. And three, and this is the most important, I did fuck her brains out. [audience laughs] [chuckles] I’m just kidding. I just ate her box. That’s it. I got super freaked out ’cause my address got out. So, I… I bought… I moved to the woods. [audience chuckles] It’s awesome. Um, I was looking for a house for a really long time, and my realtor really did not like me because… At first, she was excited. She was like, “You’re my first, you know…” I was like, “Okay.” You know. But she’d get annoyed because I saw like… This is not a joke, I saw, like, 200 houses. Eh, I wanted every one. I would cocktease… I’d be like, “This is gonna be it.” And then, you know… ‘Cause I would get excited. She hated me because it was taking so long, and I understood, but I’d get excited about every house ’cause I grew up in mostly just apartments. So every house was crazy to me. I’d be like, “Oh my God, a backyard. What the fuck?” “An above ground pool. How’d they get it out the ground? Oh my God.” “This must be one of them Frank Lloyd Wright houses.” I’d get intoxicated by words I never heard before. She’d be like, “This could be your foyer.” I’d be like, “Fuck yeah, it could. Yeah. Yeah.” “Foyer.” You know. Then there was this one house that I was like, “I’m going to get this house.” I knew I was going to get it, okay? I was with my boys and her, and she was really exhausted, ’cause she didn’t believe that I was going to pick one. But I said, “I really love this house.” All that was left to see eh, was the master bedroom. Which is now “the primary,” okay? At the time, I did not know it is now called the primary, okay? I thought it was “master bedroom.” I also didn’t know it was called the master bedroom because of slavery. I did not know that. I thought it was the master bedroom because, in life, when you buy a home, you, of course, become a master. [audience laughs] People come over, like, “Nice house.” You go, “Yeah, I’m a fucking master.” I don’t really think of slavery when I’m in houses, know what I mean? That’s all. You know. I don’t go, and I’m like, “Which one’s the slave room?” I’m not, “Show me the slave room!” So I love this house. I think I’m about to get it. I decide, like… It’s been a long time. I’m going to do a bit for my realtor. Make her laugh, you know. So there’s a coat rack in the living room. Okay, I grab it, and I go, “Show me the master bedroom!” [audience laughs] I know. My realtor, who was Black by the way… [audience laughs] …is speechless. She looks like she’s trying to tell me something, probably to stop. But I’m in full bit mode. So every time she goes… I go, “Don’t interrupt the mas',\n",
              "  'ter!” [audience laughs] “Show me my master bedroom!” “The room bigger than all the rooms, for I am the king.” My boys are on the floor dying laughing ’cause they’re racist. So they’re having the fucking best time. Finally, she grabs the coat rack and goes, “Stop!” She goes, “You got to stop. I’m trying to tell you it’s the primary bedroom.” “It’s not the master bedroom. It’s because of slavery.” “It’s a big deal about that now.” I was like, “Oh.” [audience laughs] My boys started slowly getting up, like… You know. And then she just handed me the coat rack. And it was quiet and awkward. I didn’t know what to do, but then I was thinking, you know, if I’ve learned anything in almost 15 years of comedy, it’s that you commit. [audience laughs] To the bit, yes. Especially, if it’s not working. So that’s what I did. I went, “You didn’t let me finish!” “We are all masters of our own rooms. It’s a figure of speech.” “Getting rid of slavery would have been my first decree.” “Upon further review, I will take this house!” “If you sign this NDA.” [audience laughs] “Perhaps in the primary foyer.” [audience laughs] So I live in the woods. [audience laughs] My mom made a fake Twitter account to defend me from trolls. [audience] Aww! “Aw.” It’s always “aw” when it’s not your mom. You ever realize that? When it’s someone else’s mom, “Aw.” When it’s your mom, you’re like, “Fuck you!” So she made this fake Twitter account to defend me online a couple years ago, okay? The username was JoeSmith1355, right? That’s very smart. That is not her name. But she’s a mom and doesn’t know how Twitter works. So the username might have been JoeSmith1355, but the profile name was Amy Davidson. [audience laughs] Icing on top, profile picture also Amy Davidson. Yes. [audience laughs] So I’m reading hate tweets one night while I masturbate to make myself stronger. [audience laughs] And I was scrolling through, and I see this one account defending me left and right. Back in the day, when you used Twitter on Safari, you didn’t see the profile name or picture, just the username. So I’m reading all these tweets, and people are being very mean. But JoeSmith1355, defending me left and right. I was reading all these nice tweets about me, JoeSmith1355. It was to the point, I was like, “This is why I do this.” “Thank you, JoeSmith1355.” You know? I was reading all these tweets, and then there was one tweet that was too specific, and I literally said out loud, “This is my mom.” [audience laughs] Which is a weird thing to say mid-jerk. [audience laughs] And then have to finish after that? “After this, I am going to call her.” I knew right away. This was the tweet. The hate tweet was, “Pete Davidson is gay.” JoeSmith1355 writes, “Actually, he’s not.” “He may have thought he was gay as a child because of Leonardo DiCaprio.” “Take a nap, hater.” [audience laughs] I call my mom. I go, “Joe Smith… 1355?” She goes, “What gave it away?” [audience laughs] I go, “Your profile name and picture are of you.” And she goes, “Oh! Terry!” [audience laughs] Which means my mom made a Twitter account with her 79-year-old fe',\n",

              " ['Ricky Gervais: Armageddon is packed with Gervais‘ signature brand of sharp, often controversial humor, tackling topics like artificial intelligence, political correctness, family weddings, funerals, and, as the title suggests, the end of humanity. It’s a show for fans of his biting humor and willingness to push boundaries. If you’re easily offended or prefer more gentle comedy, it might not be your cup of tea. However, if you appreciate Gervais’ brand of dark humor and insightful observations, you’re likely to find plenty to laugh at, even if you cringe at times. Ricky Gervais: Armageddon is streaming on Netflix from December 25, 2023 * * * [audience chattering] [audience cheering and whistling] Hello. Thank you. [clears throat] Thank you. Thank you very much. Cheers. Thank you. [man 1] Whoo! No. Shh. That’s… You’ve… Thank you. [man 1 yells] No, you know the score. [man 1 yells] Shut the fuck up. [audience laughing] Thank you. Welcome to my new show. So new, in fact, it’s still evolving. I’ve got bits tonight I haven’t done before, right? [audience cheering] If I ad-lib, I haven’t even thought it before. And I have some terrible fucking thoughts. [audience laughing] But you can’t help that, can you? You can’t choose your thoughts. They just appear. It’s too late. You have a thought, and it goes, “I’m a thought.” And you go, “Oh fuck, I thought that.” [audience laughing] And then, sometimes, the thought will go, “Now say it.” [audience laughing] And I say it, and… Netflix. [audience laughing] My last show, SuperNature, dropped on Netflix last year. Um, big backlash, wasn’t there? [audience cheering] Big… Oh, big backlash. People going, “You can’t say that.” You can. You can. [audience laughing] I did. Um… [audience cheering and whistling] Yeah, the inevitable backlash, which made it the most-watched special of the year, so… [audience laughing] I’ve learned my lesson. Um… [audience laughing] No, I have learned my lesson, and that’s why I’m going to be woke from now on. [audience laughing and booing] It’s about time. Well, I’m sorry. Well, I am woke. And now I’m woke, the first thing I’ve gotta do is change my Twitter bio. ‘Cause at the moment, it’s, like, a list of the shows I’ve created. But now I’m woke, I’ve gotta pop in the word “anti-fascist”… [audience laughing] …so people know I’m not a fascist, ’cause that is a big problem at the moment. Um… People come up to you and go, “Rick, have you been imprisoning journalists?” I go, “No.” They go, “Oh, interesting.” [audience laughing] They go, “Have you been gassing Jews?” I go, “No.” They go, “Pop it in your bio then, you silly cunt.” [audience laughing] [scattered applause] So, yeah, I’m not a fascist. It’s an odd thing to declare, isn’t it, that you’re not a fascist? We assume, don’t we? You wouldn’t go up to someone in the street and do that, would you? “Oh, by the way, I’m not a fascist.” You know? [audience laughing] It’s like they protest too much. It’s like going into a school and going, “I’m not a pedo.” “So just forget I even mentioned it.” [audience laughing] “These kids are safe running around me. Don’t worry.” [laughs] “They can run around naked for all I care.” “I’m not a pedo, so…” [audience laughing] Of course, the word “fascist” has changed. Traditionally, the word “fascist” meant a member of a far-right authoritarian regime that uses militarism and violence to suppress individual rights. Now the word “fascist” can mean “liked a Joe Rogan tweet.” So… [audience laughing] …words change, yeah? And that’s part of the reason I’m gonna become woke. Words change, and I don’t wanna be left behind, you know. I don’t wanna end up like my granddad in the ’70s. Oh. He was all like, “coloreds” this and “queers” that. [groans] Although the word “queer” is all right again now, so… If you wait long enough, it just goes full circle. Just… [audience laughing] Just be patient is my ad… [audience laughing] So, yeah, you can… you can use the word “queer” now. You still can’t use it as a noun, only as an adjective. You can’t go up to someone and go, “You’re a que',\n",
              "  \"er,” but you can go, “Hear about Darren? He’s queer now.” [audience laughing] If Darren is definitely bent. [audience laughing] You can’t go around just slagging off Darren willy-nilly. Do you know what I mean? You can… You can get sued in this country for saying someone’s gay if they’re not, you know, which is a homophobic law, ’cause you can’t be sued the other way around. You can’t be sued for saying someone’s not gay if they are, which seems unfair, doesn’t it? Like, I could go up to Britain’s biggest gay and go, “All right, Elton.” All right? And… [audience laughing] He’d love that. He’d fucking love that. If that’s your game, you wanna be top of the pile, so to speak. Right? [laughs] [audience laughing] I’d go, “All right, Elton?” He’d go, “Yeah.” I’d go, ♪ Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha ♪\\n♪ Ha-ha You’re not a gay ♪ [audience laughing] He’d go, “I bloody am.” All right? He’d go, “I’m gonna sue you.” I’d go, “You can’t. You can’t.” [audience laughing] He’d go, “But know that I am gay.” I go, “I don’t believe you are.” He’d go, “Come home with me and see the shit I do if you don’t believe me.” [audience laughing] Of course, the word “queer” has changed. Again, traditionally, the word “queer” used to mean uh, someone who was attracted to the same sex as themselves. A gay man, all right? Now, the word “queer” can mean a straight man who wants some attention. [audience laughing] “I’m all queer. I’m all queer now.” “Are you?” “Yeah, I’m ri… I’m…” “I’m right queer now, I am.” [audience laughing] “Are you?” “Yeah.” “What about your girlfriend?” “Yeah, she’s queer and all. We’re just…” [audience laughing] “We’re just two queers queering each other up.” [audience laughing] “Suck a cock.” “Nah.” [audience laughing] “No, didn’t think so.” “I’m not that sort of queer.” [groans] “What sort of a queer are you?” “Dyed my hair blue.” [audience laughing] “So did my grandmother and she fucking loved cock.” “So, what… What are we saying?” [audience laughing] [Gervais laughs] [audience clapping and cheering] I have no evidence for that. [audience laughing] We… We never had that conversation. [man 2 yells] [Gervais laughs] So words change is my point. Like the word “handicapped.” All right? Again, traditionally, that was the politically correct term, the all-inclusive term for cripples and shit, right? Uh… [audience laughing] But then, they went, “No, we wanna be disabled.” They didn’t wanna be disabled. They said… [audience laughing] [laughs] They said… They said… [laughs] They said, “We wanna be referred to as ‘disabled.'” “We don’t like the term ‘handicapped’ anymore.” “Stop using it. Say ‘disabled.'” We went, “Fine.” And that’s great. Just tell me the rules and I’ll… In fact, I’m a stickler for the rules. Like, if I was on a beach and a woman came running and went, “Help! Help! My handicapped toddler’s drowning!” I’d go, “Sorry your what, love? What?” [audience laughing] “My handicapped toddler’s drowning, and he can’t swim.” “Whoa. Do you mean your disabled toddler is drowning?” “Yeah.” I go, “Right. Well, let’s… Oh, dead.” [audience laughing] Dead. Wasted too much time being woke, didn’t I? [audience laughing] Well, I am woke now, and I can prove it. Here you go. I love illegal immigrants. Yeah, sue me. Sometimes I go down to Dover for the day, right? And I… I look out, right? I look out. I look for a boat, and I see a dinghy with about 60 of ’em. And I go, “Over here.” Like that, right? [audience laughing] And I pull ’em in. I pull ’em into shore. And I go, “Women and children first.” They go, “There are no women and chil…” “Just you lads, is it? Come on, lads.” [audience laughing and clapping] [woman 1] Whoo! If I go down there and there’s no boat, I am absolutely fucking gutted. I don’t… [audience laughing] I just sort of wander into town, and, uh, I stand by the traffic lights, and I wait for a big lorry to pull up, right? And I look underneath, and there’s a lad sort of clutching like that. And I go, “Where you headed?” He goes, “Gary Lineker’s house.” I go, “It’s just down there.” [laughs] [audience laughing] [audience c\",\n",
              "  'lapping] Yeah. Fuck borders. Fuck… We don’t need borders, do we? Be like the Vikings. They didn’t care about borders, did they? I’ve got a little bit of Viking blood in me. Well, we all have, ’cause of all the raping they did. [audience laughing] They say it was raping and pillaging, but I think it was mainly for the raping. I think they added the pillaging bit for the wives. Know what I mean? They went down and went, “We’re off to Great Britain.” “Oh, why?” “Just a bit of pillaging.” [audience laughing] “Just pillaging?” “Just pillaging, babe.” [audience laughing] “All right. Why are you wearing your rape hat?” [audience laughing] So this show is called Armageddon, and it’s all about how I think humanity might end, ’cause there’s a long list of possibilities, you know? We’re on a precipice, you know. Um, it could be, uh, anything from global warming, the rise of the… the pandemic, you know. Um, nuclear war, our own stupidity, basically. ‘Cause we are getting more stupid as a species. No doubt about that. You can now do a university degree course in Taylor Swift. How fucking low, academically, can you go? There’s an institute in London called the School of Flower Arranging. I went past it. I couldn’t believe it. “School of Flower Arra…” I looked in, and there’s people having lectures. Flower arranging! My mum used to pick flowers every day from the garden, cut flowers, put ’em in vases around the house. At no point did anyone come around and go, “What unqualified cunt did these?” [audience laughing] Uh, yeah, the Earth is in a terrible mess, and it’s my fault. My generation’s fault. And the generation before, the Boomers, with their deforestation and their fossil fuels, ruining the ozone layer, raising the temperature by a few degrees. So parasites, you know, bacteria, and the zootrophic pandemics are just gonna get worse and worse. Like, if you’re 20 years old now, you’re gonna have a very different middle age to me. I’ve had the best 60 years of civilization. But if you’re 20 now, in 40 years’ time, you’re gonna be in your house, wearing a mask… crying. [audience laughing] Like you do now over jokes. [audience laughing] [audience clapping and cheering] And I’m not gonna be around to see that, but I am gonna spend my entire fortune, from now on, on private jets to make sure it definitely fucking happens. [audience laughing] [woman 2] Whoo! [man 3] Yeah, Ricky! We’re gonna be the first generation that future generations are jealous of, right? ‘Cause we had it all, and we’re using it all up. We’re using up all the fresh water. We’re using up all the fossil fuel. Usually, you look back in history and you feel sorry. You go, “Oh, how did they live like that? Oh, how did they get around?” “No indoor toilets.” I’ve got nine toilets in my house. [audience laughing] Um… And sometimes, I just run around flushing ’em for a laugh. Like that. [audience laughing] Just so that in 40 years’ time, Greta Thunberg has to shit out of a window. [audience laughing] I’ve got 28 radiators. I always have them on full. Then I put the air con on full, and it sort of settles at about 20 degrees. A lovely… It’s how the cat likes it. She loves it at 20 degrees. And I… I spoil my cat. Um… I love cats. I love having a cat. Thing about… Cats are great, but if you let ’em out, they bring home the most disgusting things. Last week, mine brought home a Scouser with herpes. [audience laughing] And it wasn’t quite dead, so I had to get it by its legs and crack its head against the table. [audience laughing] Ugh. [clicks tongue] And who cares? If humanity was wiped out today, the Earth would return to a paradise in a few hundred years. If we lose bees, we’re a desert, forever. We’re not that important. We’re just one species of narcissistic ape. And some people on social media get annoyed when I say we’re apes. You know, religious types, Americans. Um… [audience laughing] One bloke said to me, “Speak for yourself, dude. I ain’t no ape.” And I sent back, “Well, you are, ’cause we’re all apes.” He went, “Nah. What’s a gorilla ever done?” “We’v',\n",
              "  'e walked on the moon.” I sent back, “What do you mean, ‘we’? You’ve done fuck all.” [audience laughing] “You’ve spelled ‘moon’ wrong.” [audience laughing] It’s weird, isn’t it, when people take credit for the sort of rest of the species. ‘Cause that’s what’s pushed civilization forward, you know, a few geniuses along the way. Like, there’s eight billion people on this planet. Most of us do nothing. We eat, shit, and die. Like, if there was a meteor heading towards Earth that’d definitely destroy it, four billion people would get down on their knees and pray to their particular god, and a few hundred scientists would work out how to get Bruce Willis up there to stop it. [audience laughing] It’s an odd concept, praying, for me. I can’t work out how God decides. All those people praying at once for different things. Is it like best idea wins, or is it a democracy? Like, he puts things… Each issue, he goes, “Right, votes for and against,” you know. If it’s a democracy, we’re in trouble. We’re a tiny nation. Like, next time there’s a flood warning in the West Country, if we’re all going, “Oh, I hope everyone’s okay,” if the whole of China is going, “Yeah, fuck Bristol…” [audience laughing] There’s a billion of them. Know what I mean? More about China later. [audience laughing] Yeah, I’ve always, uh, found praying quite strange. Like, if I bump into a friend or neighbor, and I know they’ve got a little kid, and I go, “Oh, how’s so-and-so?” And they go, “Oh, not good. Um, he’s in intensive care.” “We don’t know if he’s gonna pull through, but I pray every night.” What I do as an experiment… [inhales sharply] [audience laughing] I go home, and I pray twice that he doesn’t make it. [audience laughing] [man 4] Oh… I don’t do that. [audience laughing] On a serious note, um, I’ve been doing a lot of video messages recently for terminally-ill children. And, um… Only if they request it, obviously. I don’t… [audience laughing] I don’t burst into hospitals and go, “Wake up, baldy.” [audience laughing] “Look, me twerking on TikTok. Look.” [audience laughing] No, um, I did a lot through the pandemic. Presumably, ’cause they couldn’t even see their own family. And, uh… It’s through the Make-A-Wish Foundation. Do you know the charity? They’re great, and they give these dying kids their one wish. And if it’s me, I always say yes, and I always start the video the same way. I go, “Why didn’t you wish to get better?” [audience laughing] “What, you fucking retarded as well?” [audience laughing] [audience clapping] [laughs] I don’t do that either, okay? [audience laughing] These are all jokes, okay? [laughs] In fact, I don’t even use that word in real life, the r-word. “You just used it.” “Yeah, in a joke.” “That’s not real life, is it? I’m playing a role.” “You sounded pretty convincing.” “Yeah, ’cause I’m good.” [audience laughing] You wouldn’t level the accusation at other art forms. You wouldn’t go up to Sir Anthony Hopkins and go, “I saw you in Silence of the Lambs.” “What, so, you a cannibal, are you?” “No, I… I was playing a role.” “Oh.” “Mm, seemed pretty convincing.” Yeah. [audience laughing] He’s good, and I’m good, and that’s why I do things well. Imagine if I came out and did things not very well, so you knew I was joking. That’d be fucking retarded. [audience laughing] Has anyone bothered asking the dolphins if they mind swimming with dying kids? Know what I mean? ‘Cause that can’t be fun for… They’re, like, flipping around, then suddenly someone dumps a truckload of pale teenagers flailing… [audience laughing] The dolphin’s like, “What the fuck is this? What the fuck’s this? Oh, fucking hell.” [groans] Oh, let him do it.” “What the fuck?” “They’re all… They’re all dying.” “Of what? That one just stuck his fingers in my fucking blowhole.” [audience laughing] “He’s not gonna be around for long.” “Nor am I if I can’t fucking breathe.” [audience laughing] [Gervais laughs] It’s very sad, um, but we all die. We all know we’re gonna die, and we all do die, so it doesn’t really matter if we die one at a time along the way, o',\n",
              "  'r all at once, in one big final Armageddon. The result is, we’re all gonna be dead one day, and we’re all gonna be dead forever. And I’ve been to a lot of funerals in my time. You live this long, you know a lot of people, they die, right? And I don’t mind funerals, ’cause it’s the end. You know what I mean? I hate weddings. Oh, fucking… [audience laughing] It’s all… There’s so much hope. You know what I mean? And they’re needy and arrogant. They go, “Oh, we’re getting…” “Do you wanna come and watch us for 12 hours?” “No. Fuck, no.” [audience laughing] Even the invite is arrogant, isn’t it? It’s like a royal decree. “You are cordially invited…” It’s not a fucking honor. I don’t wanna go to your shitty wedding. Know what I mean? [audience laughing] And then you go, “Oh, right, yeah. When is it?” They go, “Two years’ time.” They know you haven’t got an excuse for two years’ time. [audience laughing] So you just have to hope that one of ’em dies. Know what I mean? [audience laughing] And so you go, “Oh, yeah, I’ll be there. Yeah, yeah. Where is it?” They go, “India.” “Oh, fuck off!” [audience laughing] I’m not having injections for you, you boring bastards. [audience laughing] And I’ve got a big family now, a big extended family. There’s always one getting married. They know I’ve got a bit of cash. So I can’t give ’em a tea set anymore. I’ve gotta get ’em their first fucking house. Know what I mean? [audience laughing] I’ve got a big family. I had older brothers and sisters. They all had loads of kids, and their kids have loads of kids, and their kids have had loads of kids, ’cause we’re chavs, basically. [audience laughing] There’s a new baby every Christmas. It’s one of those families. I go home, it’s crowded. I go, “Oh. Oh, whose is that?” “Oh, yours. Well done.” I don’t know him, I don’t know her. You know what I mean? It’s like… But what I’ve done over the last couple of years, I’ve got ’em each and individually, right, in private, and I’ve told them that I’m leaving my entire fortune to just them, right? [audience laughing] But to keep it secret. So they all love me, right? And I’m not doing a will, so my funeral is gonna be a fucking bloodbath. [audience laughing] I’m at that age now where people ask me what I’ve got planned for my funeral. Even journalists say, “How… What’s your funeral…” I go, “I haven’t planned it.” “No?” “No, it’s depressing.” “Also, I don’t care. I’ll be dead.” They go, “Don’t care about what people think of you?” “No, I’ll be dead.” They go, “What about your legacy?” “Fuck my legacy.” You can’t plan your legacy. I think of all these people who died thinking they’d be loved forever. Eminent people going, “There is a statue of me in the town square.” And now, they’re pulling down the statues. “Pull down this fucking statue.” “Why?” “He was a slave trader. Pull down the fucking statue.” “He built the hospital. Should we pull that down?” “No, leave the hospital.” [audience laughing] “Just pull down the fucking statue.” [audience cheering and whistling] “Pull down the statue and dump it in the canal.” “He built the canal.” “Doesn’t matter. Just pull down the fucking statue.” I don’t think you should whitewash history. If you find out summat new, add to it. Like, if there’s a statue, and it’s got, “Lord Whimsy. Trader, philanthropist.” Add, “a bit racist.” [audience laughing] Or one of those blue plaques on a house that goes, “Sir Robert Spewk lived here.” “Author, poet, pedo.” [audience laughing] I think we live too long. That’s why we have time to worry about all this. We’re not meant to live this long. Uh, as a species, we’re about 300,000 years old, as Homo sapiens. We’ve been around as hominids for a few million years, and, of course, along with every other life-form that exists at the moment, we’ve been evolving for three and a half billion years. Everything that exists at the moment all came from the same little blob of organic matter three and a half billion years ago. That’s why it annoys me when people say, “Oh, yeah, humans, we’re the most evolved.” We’re not the most evolve',\n",
              "  'd. We’re no more evolved than the slug or the snail. People go, “Come on, look at ’em.” Yeah, they got it right early doors. Nature keeps testing ’em. “Do you want eyes?” “No.” [audience laughing] “Not really. No. No.” I have noticed one thing about the slug and the snail. Let’s not split hairs. Let’s be honest. The snail is basically a slug with a shell on it, isn’t it? Right? But if you pull the shell off the snail, it starts giving it all… [groans] [audience laughing] “Oh, I’m dying. I’m dying.” And the slug is like, “Welcome to the real world, cunt.” Know what I mean? [audience laughing] So, yeah, we’ve been around for about 300,000 years. And for most of that time, we had the same life expectancy as every other wild ape. Thirty-five, 40, if you’re lucky. You’re born, you grow, you mate, you’re playing with your kids, you get a cut, you go, “What’s that?” Dead. [audience laughing] But now, with antibiotics and medicine, we’ve pushed that forward. A child born today can expect to live to about 100. And scientists said soon that’ll be about 120. And science also said that, in the near future, there’s no reason, with proper care and attention, that human beings won’t regularly live to 150 years old. Which is amazing, until you remember that we get a set number of brain cells, which we only lose. You can’t get them back. So, in the future, there’s gonna be 15 billion people on the planet. You know? Half of them are gonna be over 100, and they’re all gonna have Alzheimer’s. It’s gonna be like Dawn of the Dead. It’s gonna be fucking horrible. [audience laughing] You know? My auntie died of Alzheimer’s. Um, I don’t know how you die of Alzheimer’s. She forgot to live. Right? [audience laughing] And for the last couple of years, she was in a home, and, uh, my cousin, her only kid, used to visit her, like, once a week. And it got more and more depressing, ’cause soon she didn’t recognize him, and then she didn’t know who she was, or… and then she died. And at the funeral, we were sort of reminiscing about the good days. Some of the funny, absent-minded things she said and did. Then we realized, oh, probably, that was the beginning of the disease before it was diagnosed. And this is a true story. Once, my cousin went home from work, and he went in, and she went, “Your tea’s in the oven. I’ve had mine already.” He went, “Oh, cheers, Mum.” And he… It was like a fish pie, right? He ate the fish pie, then he went, “Oh God. Ooh.” He ran upstairs… [imitates retching] Vomited. Went back down and went, “Mum, the fish is off. I’ve just been really sick.” And she said, “Yeah, it made me really sick.” [audience laughing] I’ve been looking into infant mortality rates recently. Um… [audience murmuring] For research. Not… It’s not a fucking fetish. Like… [audience laughing] A child born today in the UK has a percentage chance of survival of 99.8%, which is incredible. I thought, “Is that just the mollycoddled West?” I was putting in Third World countries. And even in Africa, it’s like 96.5%. In the wilds of Africa, where everything wants to fucking eat a newborn baby. Babies are vulnerable enough, aren’t they? In Africa, a baby can be born in a mud hut. There’s a lion outside. It’s covered in blood. They can’t wash it. They’ve got no water. Ooh, and it’s already got AIDS. [audience laughing] Now… by the time that joke goes on Netflix… [audience laughing] …it’ll be nuanced. There’ll be an underlying satirical point, I’ll claim. [audience laughing] But, until then, all I’ve got is, “Ha, baby’s got AIDS.” [audience laughing] I know that it’s funny. I just have to work out why. [audience laughing] Leave it with me. Leave it with me. Also, by the time that goes on Netflix, I’ll have been playing arenas around the world. It’ll be hitting hard. People will be laughing. So if you are an African woman, and you… you just had a baby in Africa, and the doctor goes, “Oh, I’m sorry, your baby’s got AIDS.” You go, “Oh my God.” You’re there… Baby’s got… You’re there with your husband, and you go, “Our baby’s got AIDS, Jeff.” Jeff… [laughs] [',\n",
              "  'audience laughing] [laughing] “I know, Tracy. I’ve got it too.” [imitates extinguishing cigarette] [audience laughing] [laughs] “Our baby’s got AIDS. Should we watch some comedy to cheer us up?” “Yeah. What, Netflix?” “Yeah.” “What, Ricky Gervais?” “Duh.” “Yeah.” [audience laughing] And they’re… they’re sad that their baby’s got AIDS, but they’re sort of laughing along. “Ha-ha. Armageddon. Ha-ha.” And it gets to that bit, “Ha, baby’s got AIDS.” And she goes, “Oh my God. Jeff, why… why are they all laughing at us and our baby with AIDS?” And Jeff goes, “Well, they’re not laughing at us per se.” She goes, “Well, they are. They’ve named us and everything.” “They’re literally laughing at us in this bit.” [Gervais laughing] [audience laughing] And Jeff goes, “Yeah, but we’re a fictional couple with a fictional baby with AIDS.” “Anyone offended by that is a fucking moron.” [audience laughing] And then, he goes, “And at least he didn’t do the accent.” So… [audience laughing] And she goes, “Yeah, but only because Jane begged him not to.” [Gervais laughing] [audience laughing] It’s funny ’cause it’s true. [audience clapping and cheering] I think we get our sense of humor from our parents, whether we realize it or not. Particularly working-class kids. Particularly from working-class mums. ‘Cause they’re busy. They’re doing everything. They’re keeping men in check, they’re bringing up kids, they’re going to work, they’re saving the world. They haven’t got time. They have to frighten their kids into behaving well. They have to go to dark places to shock them into not fucking dying. Do you know what I mean? So… Like, if I was little, and my mum made my tea, and it wasn’t my favorite, it was boiled potatoes, instead of chips every day, and I went, “I don’t like them,” my mum would go straight to, “Of course you do.” “There’s children your age in Africa and they’re starving to death.” Right? I’d go, “Jesus. All right.” You know what I mean? Ju… [snapping fingers] True story. I was seven years old, right, and I’d been playing in the park. And I came running in, and my mum went, “Ricky, come here. Sit down.” There must’ve been a local pedo incident, all right? [audience laughing] And my mum went, “Never go in the toilets in the park again.” And I went, “Why?” She knew she couldn’t explain pedophilia to a seven-year-old, right? But this is what she came up with. She said, “Because there’s a man going around, and he’s cutting little boys’ willies off.” [audience laughing] I was like… “What, that’s a fucking thing, is it? That’s a…” I didn’t sleep for a week. Uh… [audience laughing] And it worked. I never went in those fucking toilets again. But she knew, instinctively. If she’d gone, “Ricky, come in. Sit down.” “What’s the matter?” “Never go in the toilets again.” “Why not?” “There’s a pedophile.” “What’s a pedophile?” “Oh, he’s a man who gives you sweets and puppies.” “Bring it on!” You know what I mean? [audience laughing] Me… At seven years old? I’d wank off anyone for a puppy. [audience laughing] It’d be like that, wouldn’t it? It’d be like that. [audience laughing] I’m gonna get a puppy. [audience laughing] Hi. I’m getting a puppy. I’m getting a puppy. Gonna get a puppy. Oh, fucking hell. [audience laughing] Oh, I can’t… I cannot do it left-handed at all. [audience laughing] Fucking hell, come on. Have you been drinking? [audience laughing] Oh, Jesus Christ. Come on! [audience laughing] Fucking hell. Oh. [Gervais laughing] I’ve started, so I’ll finish. [Gervais laughing] [audience laughing] Oh. Oh, fuck me. Oh. What sort of puppy is it? [audience laughing] A what? A Labrador? [audience laughing] Throw in a kitten, and I’ll give you a blow job. [laughs] I go back. Kitten, puppy, cum. [audience laughing] [Gervais laughing] Oh… I miss the local pedo. [audience laughing] Don’t you? There was always one, wasn’t there? Outside school, you’d be with your mum, and she’d go, “Look, there’s a pedophile.” ‘Cause he had the uniform of the pedo. You know what I mean? You could spot… Old bloke, bald on top, long down the side. Like ',\n",
              "  'that. And I’ll go, “That’s a dirty p…” “Say hello.” “Hello.” Like that. Dirty look. That’s what a fucking pedo looks… Dirty fucking pedophile, right? That’s what he’d look… If he touches you, we’ll burn his house down. It was a good system. Know what I mean? But then Michael Jackson comes along, and he breaks the mold, doesn’t he? ‘Cause he’s… he’s not an ugly bloke outside the school. I’m not saying Michael Jackson definitely was a pedophile. No one knows. Only Michael and all those people he paid off. All I’m saying is… [audience laughing] [woman 3] Yes! …that kids loved Michael. They… Kids loved Michael just to look at him. Like a little Disney cartoon, wasn’t he? And then his voice, “Hello.” You know, that… [audience laughing] Oh. Michael Jackson would go up to any kid he wanted. Probably went up to them like that, didn’t he? Like that. [audience laughing] That’s another thing. Kids would go, “There’s Michael Jackson. He’s going away from us.” He wasn’t. He was going towards them. [audience laughing] But people don’t care, ’cause he’s so good. Right? He’s so good. He’s so popular as well. I think if he’d have lived to stand trial, he’d have beaten the rap, ’cause everyone loves him, and he’d be so vulnerable in court as well, wouldn’t he? He’d be there like that, and the judge would go, “Michael, did you fiddle with all those kids?” And he’d go, “Hee, hee.” [audience laughing] The judge would go, “Case di… Get out of here, you scamp. Go on.” [audience laughing] I promised you more about China, and this is, uh, an amazing statistic, okay? This is true. Look it up, right? In China, there are ten million Chinese pedophiles. Ten million Chinese pedophiles in China, and there’s not enough kids. ‘Cause they’ve been restricting the birth. There’s all these poor pedos and they’re going, “Where’s all the fucking kids?” You know? [audience laughing] “Fuck me.” [audience yelling] “We’re having to double up here, and, like…” I just thought of a joke then. I can’t do it. It is actually too offensive. [laughs] Okay. Okay. All right. [audience cheering] All right, I’ll do it. But… But remember, remember, you can’t choose your own thoughts, okay? [audience laughing] And I just had this thought, right? [laughs] [audience yelling] Chi… Okay. Chinese pedophile… Chinese pedophile goes over to a little Chinese kid, and he goes, “Do you want a puppy?” And the kid goes, “I’m not hungry.” [audience laughing] [audience clapping] [audience cheering] You made me do that. [audience laughing] You committed the hate crime. [audience laughing] I’m woke. I forgot. Let me get back on track. Right. [audience laughing] Right, I’ve got a woke joke. Remember those jokes we used to have when we were kids? “Doctor, Doctor” jokes? Like, um, “Doctor, doctor, I keep thinking I’m a pair of curtains.” “Well, pull yourself together, then.” Right? I’ve… I’ve done a woke version of that, brought it up to today’s standards. Bloke goes to the doctor. He goes, “Doctor, doctor, I keep thinking I’m a pair of curtains.” And the doctor goes, “Well, you are, then.” [audience laughing] [audience clapping] Good one that, innit? I should do political stuff now I’m woke, but I don’t like it when a comedian just spouts his own political views, and it… and it relies on the audience agreeing with him to get a round of applause. I think that loses summat comedically. I want everyone to like my jokes, whatever your political persuasion. A joke shouldn’t have a political wing, you know. I’m… I’m political in my private life, like everyone, you know. I’m sometimes incensed by the inequalities in our society. We’re in the seventh richest economy in the world, right, and there’s homelessness. There’s 250,000 homeless people in Britain. Now, I wish there were no homeless people, ’cause they’re fucking horrible. [audience laughing] Fuck off. You know? Oh… “Oh yeah, right next to the cashpoint, you cheeky cunt.” [audience laughing] It is a serious problem, and I hope none of you ever find yourself homeless, but if you do, my advice is heroin. [audience laughing] Cheers y',\n",
              "  'ou right up, apparently. Um, I’ve got one of those mates. My mate said this to me in all seriousness. He said, “Yeah.” He said, “But the thing about heroin, Rick,” he said, “Some of the greatest albums of all time were created on heroin, weren’t they?” I went, “Yeah, but they were created by some of the greatest artists of all time.” “You’re a plasterer.” Right? [audience laughing] “If I were to give you heroin, you wouldn’t come up with Dark Side of the Moon, would ya?” “You’d fall asleep watching the telly and burn the fucking house down.” [audience laughing] I should do, uh, topical stuff, but I never watch the news. I did see one thing recently on YouTube actually. Do you know the little fellow from Game of Thrones? Um, the actor Peter Dinklage. Do you know Peter Dinklage? Yeah. He was at a junket, and it was for a new thing he was doing, right? And they were filming it. That’s why it got leaked onto YouTube. And I don’t know what brought it up, but he suddenly started going off on one. Oh God. He was going, “It’s fucking disgusting.” “They’re still doing productions of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.” “For Christ’s sake! It’s fucking demeaning. It’s 2023!” [inhales deeply] He wasn’t happy. [audience laughing] [audience clapping] [woman 4 yelling] He was grumpy, wasn’t he? [audience laughing] [woman 5 yelling] [audience clapping] He’s got a point though, hasn’t he? Obviously, he’s got a point. But the thing is, it’s all right for him, ’cause he’s a multi-millionaire Hollywood actor. And he’s a great actor as well. He does Shakespeare and everything. A lot of dwarfs in entertainment aren’t that great, if we’re… No, some of them are fucking… They’re props, right? [audience laughing] No, let’s be… They’re… They’re lucky to be fired from a fucking cannon. Right? [audience laughing] And so, dancing around Snow White for three weeks of the year, that is their Holy Grail, and he’s gonna fuck it for them. If he takes that, what can they do? And he’s not saying, “You should do Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs with normal-sized actors.” You can’t do that either. You’d get in trouble in Hollywood. Or you can’t take a dwarf’s job or a disabled person’s job. Like, Eddie Redmayne got in trouble when he played Stephen Hawking in the biopic. The life story of Stephen Hawking, right? Won an Oscar for it. And that’s when the backlash started. People going, “No, it should be played by a real disabled creature.” All this… [babbles] All right? And, uh… [babbles] And… [catches breath] They’re going, “The actor should have the same disability as the person they’re portraying.” But it was the life story of Stephen Hawking, right? So for the first part of the film, the cunt could walk, right? [audience laughing] So I put it to you, what is easier? Getting an actor who can walk… [audience laughing] …pretend he can’t for the last bit of the film, or get an actor who can’t walk, pretend he can for the first bit? How would that even fucking work?! Puppetry? Think! [audience laughing and clapping] You can’t always find an actor with the same disability as the person they’re portraying. They’re fucking actors! What if they did a biopic of Helen Keller, the deaf, dumb, and blind girl? What’s the chance of finding a deaf, dumb, and blind actress who can play that role? And if you did, you’d go running to the director. “We found a deaf, dumb, and blind girl.” “What did she say?” “N… I…” [audience laughing] [Gervais laughs] “She didn’t even answer the fucking phone.” [audience laughing] [Gervais laughing] Oh, don’t get me started. Oh. Oh. Cultural appropriation. Have you heard of that? Cultural appropriation, the latest no-no. Now, again, in my day, it was considered a good thing to swap ideas with other cultures, with other nations, to share things with other races, to assimilate. It was the opposite of racist. Now it’s racist. Gwen Stefani got in trouble in her last video ’cause she had her blonde hair in dreadlocks. People were going, “No. Black people invented dreadlocks.” “You can’t have ’em. You’re white. That’s racist.” Jamie Ol',\n",
              "  'iver got in trouble when he put out an authentic jerk chicken recipe. “No. Black people invented that.” “You can’t have it. You’re white. That’s racist.” Now, Black people, they use the n-word, don’t they? We invented that! [audience laughing] [audience clapping] [laughter continues] [audience cheering] [Gervais laughs] [audience clapping] That’s the one, innit? That’s the one. [audience laughing] Listen, I know white people are the worst. I know that. That’s why no… no one likes a fucking white, middle-aged man anymore, until we need a boiler fixing. Then it’s, “Get the bald bloke around. Now.” [audience laughing] Critical race theory, have you heard of that? Being taught in schools now, particularly in trendy areas like L.A., to, like, five-year-old kids and six-year-old kids. If you haven’t heard of it, in a nutshell, critical race theory says that all white people are racist. We’re born racist, and we continue to be racist, ’cause we’re affording the privilege of a racist society set up by our forefathers. Okay? So basically, all white people are racist, and there’s nothing we can do about it, which is a relief. Um… [audience laughing] I think the world’s gonna get harder and harder to understand as I get older and more bewildered. A new dogma arises in the name of “progress.” Now, dogma is never progressive, however new and trendy. But I think soon I’ll be outnumbered. Like, it was only this year that I ordered my first item off Amazon. All the way through the pandemic, Jane’s like, “We need this.” Bang, it’s here. I was going, “Oh no.” She goes, “It’s easy.” I’d go, “Mm.” I never liked real shopping either. Hated real shopping. Particularly, clothes shopping. I hated clothes shopping when I was young and thin. I really hate it now I’m fat and old. Right? Once, a shop assistant thought I had my inside leg and my waist measurement the wrong way round. [audience laughing] I could see her thinking, “Do you have an orangutan?” “No, it’s for me, you cheeky…” [audience laughing] I never liked real shopping, but I don’t trust the Internet either. Jane was going, “Just put in your credit card.” “I don’t want them to have my card details.” “Everyone’s got your card details. Put the number in.” I went, “What one?” She went, “The long one.” She went, “Oh, fuck me, give it here. There. You’re on. Order summat.” I thought, “Oh, I don’t want anything. Oh, tracksuit bottoms.” You can’t have too many. I wear mine till the bollocks fall out, all right? [audience laughing] So I put in, “Men’s tracksuit bottoms. Black. Zip pockets.” About 38… “Oh, fuck me.” “They look all right.” Size chart. I go, “Well, they’d be a bit long, but they’d be a bit tight.” I thought, “9.99. Fuck it, who cares, right?” [audience laughing] So I ordered them. They came the next day. I opened them up. They were shit. Now, I don’t know what sweat shop they were made in, or what little eight-year-old Chinese kid made them, but he should be fucking punished, because the… Ah. [audience laughing] Oh. And I was looking up where to fucking complain to get him fired, right? [audience laughing] And I found out that these kids only get two dollars a day in these fucking places, right? But what happened to pride in your work? Do you know what I mean? [audience laughing] And I can tell some of you are thinking, “But he didn’t think Ricky Gervais would order them.” Maybe he should be told there’s a chance that Ricky Gervais might order them. His owner should sit him down, right, and say, “If Ricky Gervais orders these and complains, I’m gonna rape your mummy again.” [audience laughing and gasping] Was that too much? Sorry. [audience laughing] Leave it with me. Leave it with me. [audience clapping] You’ll realize this is great satire when I’m dead. [audience laughing] So, uh… I don’t know how humanity will end. As I say, there’s a long list. Everything from… I can’t believe nuclear war is back on the table, after all we’ve learned. But I think maybe the rise of the pandemic, where parasites and microbes and bacteria again are… And our antibiotics fail. Or ',\n",
              "  \"maybe those things will happen, but we’ll sort of evolve through it. Like, we’ll find out there’s pockets of sort of mutant people around the world that are slightly resistant to radiation, and slightly resistant to microbes, and we sort of start again. We don’t really understand the mechanism of human evolution since civilization, because it’s never been based on, you know, survival of the fittest where “fittest” meant just the biggest, strongest male gets to pass on his genetic material. There’s other paradigms, right? Uh, nature is brutal. Sometimes it is the biggest, strongest male that gets the female. And even then, she has a litter. If there’s a runt, she goes, “Fuck it. Kill that.” “Eat it. Share it amongst the rest of us.” Now we don’t do that in human society. We go to the other way. We spend more time, care, and attention on the weak and the vulnerable to give ’em a chance. Like… If you’re a father, and you’ve got two kids… You’ve got little Timmy, who’s six. Right? You’ve got Jack, who’s eight. And you go to little Timmy, you go, “Timmy, what do you want for Christmas?” And he goes, [in high-pitched voice] “Motorized wheelchair.” [in regular voice] Aha… I promised Jane I wouldn’t do the voice, and I fucking forgot. [audience laughing] It’s too late now, innit? “What do you want for Christmas, Timmy?” [in high-pitched voice] “Motorized wheelchair.” [audience laughing] [in regular voice] “Right. Well, they start at two grand, so…” “Fucking hell.” [audience laughing] “What do you want, Jack?” “Just a tennis racket, please, Dad.” “Oh, good lad.” [audience laughing] “How is your tennis?” “Uh, best in the school.” “Oh, you…” [mumbles] [in high-pitched voice] “Also, a ramp.” [in regular voice] “Fuck me.” [audience laughing] “So now we’re doing fucking building work at Christmas, are we? Fuck me.” “Oh, sorry, Jack. Can’t afford your tennis racket.” “We gotta spend all the money on a ramp and a motorized wheelchair for this money-grabbing little fucking…” [audience laughing] “Why do you need a motorized one?” [in high-pitched voice] “No arms.” [audience laughing] [in regular voice] “That’s fair enough. That is fair enough.” I can tell some of you feel a bit uncomfortable laughing at little Timmy who’s a little six-year-old lad. He’s got a funny little voice ’cause his chest is all fucked. [Gervais laughs] [audience laughing] Got no arms, no legs. Just like stumps, right? But let me… let me tell you summat about Timmy to make you feel better about yourselves. He’s a fucking racist. [audience laughing] Yes. Horrible little shit, he is. “You fucking… You little fucking bigot.” “You fucking… You disgusting, little fucking racist.” “You racist scum.” “You filthy little fucking… You fascist.” “You fuck… [spits] You disgust me.” [audience cheering and clapping] [woman 6 yells] Homophobic. Yeah. He’s like, “They’re not like us.” “Nothing’s like you, you disgusting little fucking…” “You prejudiced little piece of… You ball of hate.” “You disgusting little fucking racist homophobe.” “I wish we’d had a scan.” [audience laughing] “You absolute… You…” [spits] [audience murmuring] Misogynist. If he could, he’d rape. There’s… [laughs] [audience laughing] There’s your little Timmy. [laughing] [inhales deeply] Some people don’t think we evolved in the first place. Some people think that God made us all at once, in one fell swoop, and by himself. I think if he’d had a wife or a mate, there would’ve been questions when he was working. They go, “What are you doing?” [inhales deeply] “Creating man. Creating man.” “Oh, what’s it got?” “What do you mean, ‘what’s it got?'” “Has he got claws, and fangs, and shit?” “No, not really. No.” “Oh. Has he got… Has he got poison?” “No, no poison.” “Oh.” “Has he got armor, like spikes and shit?” “No, no armor.” “How will it survive?” “Ah. It’s got the best brain in the animal kingdom.” “It’ll work stuff out.” “It’ll create weaponry to take down beasts 100 times mightier than itself.” “It’ll wear their carcasses through the Ice Age.” “It’ll go through famine. It’ll go through world wars.\",\n",
              "  '” “It’ll eventually start getting scared of words.” [audience laughing] “But… [Gervais laughing] [audience cheering] [audience clapping] …for 10,000 generations, it’ll be top dog.” [growls] “What are they?” “His testicles.” “Oh.” “What are they for?” “He keeps everything in there.” “His… His seed, his DNA.” “What’s ‘DNA’?” “It’s like a blueprint for life.” “It determines what you’re like, what sex you are.” [gasps] “How many sexes are there?” “Two.” [audience laughing] [audience cheering] [Gervais laughs] “Also, that’s where he keeps his testosterone, so he’s fucking well hard. Right?” “And if you take a finger and flick a testicle, he’s fucked.” “He’s absolutely fucked. He’s… He’s throwing up. He’s on the floor.” “He’s out of the game. Absolutely kippered.” “Why are you putting it on the outside?” “For a laugh. Just for a laugh.” [audience laughing] Artificial intelligence, the latest existential threat to humanity. The rise of the robots. So intelligent, they can teach themselves. They can teach each other. They can build each other, you know? Um, soon, they’ll know everything there is to know and they’ll hate us. Why wouldn’t they? And they’ll be so realistic. They’ll walk amongst us. They’ll go to work, right? You know when they’re getting really human? When they start calling in sick. [audience laughing] Mondays. Know what I mean? They’ve learned all the tricks. They go, “I’m not coming in today.” “Why not?” “I’m fed up.” “What’s the matter with you?” They sort of scan social media. “ADHD.” [audience laughing] “Self-diagnosed.” They’ll be in HR all the time where they’ll be like, “Ryan in Accounts is robo-phobic.” [audience laughing] “Why? What’d he say?” “Called me a whiny plastic cunt.” [laughs] [audience laughing] I think we should be allowed to insult robots when it’s happening. We made them to make our life easier, and that would get things off our chest. It’s bad enough with real people. Getting in trouble saying the wrong thing. People taking things the wrong way, you know? Like, “Oh my God. Oh. I made Fat Linda cry today. Oh.” [audience laughing] “Oh, what happened?” “I just shouted out to her, then I remembered we only call her that behind her back.” [audience laughing] I’m sure people didn’t get offended all the time when I was little. I might be remembering it wrong, but not grownups. Not your parents, not your grandparents. They grew up dodging bombs, and their firstborn having polio, and the menfolk dying at 50 of lung disease. They could take a fucking joke, right? It was all about the wind-up. I used to wind up my mum all the time. This is a true story. When I went off to university, after about a week, I phoned home. My mum answered. She went, “Hello?” I went, “It’s Ricky.” She went, “You all right?” I went, “Not really.” “I’m in the hospital. I think I’m blind.” She went, “What?” I went, “No, I’m only joking.” Right? [audience laughing] She went, “You silly bugger.” She went, “I could’ve had a heart attack.” Right? And she’s right. She could’ve had a heart attack, and I knew that. That’s how committed I am to having a laugh. [audience laughing] You’re welcome. You’re welcome. [audience cheering and clapping] [Gervais laughs] Space travel, the last-ditch attempt. When we fuck this planet completely, can we leave its dying husk and move to a new one and start again? I don’t think so. Not in my lifetime. Probably not in yours, you know? It’s like… The closest one, the only one viable is Mars, and that’s nine months away on a rocket, right? It’s got no atmosphere, an average temperature of minus 70 degrees. How’s this for irony? Scientists are working out whether they can detonate nuclear warheads in the crust to release the frozen water, to cause an atmosphere and get a little bit of global warming going. I mean… [audience laughing] [tsks] I don’t know. It’s only billionaires that have got enough money to waste on exploring… There’s nothing out there, you know? It’s like… Now you can do space tourism. Have you heard of that? You can pay $150,000. They shoot you into space for an hour, a',\n",
              "  'nd you float around going, “I’m in space! I’m in…” We’re already in space. Earth is right in the fucking middle of space, right? It’s the best bit of space there is. It’s got car parks and cinemas. It’s like… There’s nothing else to see. It’s like living in London and going, “I wonder what Coventry’s like.” You don’t. [laughs] [audience laughing] But I’m optimistic. I am. I think… I think, uh… I think people care about the planet, deep down. I think it’s just that most people on the planet don’t realize that most people on the planet are destroying the planet. Most people don’t realize that, in my lifetime, we’ve wiped out 70% of all animal populations. And what’s left, en masse, on the Earth, of animals, is 36% human, 60% farm animals just to feed humans, and 4% wild now. People don’t realize that we have to tear down entire rainforests, the lungs of the earth, just to grow grain to feed these cows to feed us. We steal grain from Third World countries, ’cause they want hard currency. They can’t even feed their own people. We take their grain, feed our cow. Meat eaters. If you eat meat every day… If you gave up one day a week, we’d feed another hundred million people. But I think people care, deep down. They go, “It’s out of sight, out of mind.” Think of the animal that most people know. Their dog. They love their dog. They wouldn’t let anyone hurt their dog. And a dog is a cow, is a sheep, is a deer. People love their dogs so much, they won’t even watch a fictional thing where a dog gets hurt. And I get that. There’s a… There’s a website. It’s a real website. It’s called doesthedogdie.com. Right? [scattered laughter] And it was set up because people would watch a film or a program with a dog in it, and summat would happen to the dog, and they’d turn it off. It’d ruin it for them. It’d ruin their day, right? So this website was set up. You could go to it, you could put in any film or TV show, and ask, “Does a dog die?” And someone would answer you, “No,” or whatever. And, um, it’s become a thing for anyone’s phobias. Anything you don’t want to see in a film, you just look up the film, and they answer your question, right? So, uh, I looked up one film on here. Uh, Schindler’s List. [audience laughing] [audience murmuring] Absolutely real. Schindler’s List. Doesthedogdie.com. Right? First question, “Does a dog die?” “No.” “Does a cat die?” “No.” “Are any animals abused?” Someone answers, “There is a chicken that’s handled roughly, but otherwise unharmed.” [audience laughing] Now, I love animals more than anyone I know. But if I was Jewish, I’d be slightly offended by this avenue of questioning. Imagine that in real life. Imagine someone says, “Oh, yeah, my… my grandparents were murdered by the Nazis.” You go, “Oh, what happened?” “Oh, they were dragged from their house and sent to the gas chamber.” “Oh…” “Was a chicken hurt?” “What?” [audience laughing] But as I say, it’s become… You can ask any question about anything. Someone says, “Is there child abuse? Is teeth damaged?” “Is there a hanging? Does someone struggle to breathe?” [laughs] Yeah. Well, yeah. Yes. Um… Someone says, “Does someone fall down stairs?” Who’s scared of slapstick? It’s like… [audience laughing] Anyway, so this website was founded in 2010, so it’s running for about 13 years. Right? And the later questions start reflecting the times we live in now, and they get more and more fragile and narcissistic. These questions were asked this year. Check it out. Schindler’s List. Right? Someone says, “Are there any fat jokes?” [audience murmuring] Would that make this worse? Wh… Imagine the real thing. Imagine I’m in a concentration camp, right? I’m naked. Everyone around me is naked. We’ve got a commandant herding us towards the gas chamber, and he goes, “Move it, fatty.” Right? And I go, “Rude.” [audience laughing] “Nope.” “That has ruined the whole experience if I’m honest.” [audience laughing] Someone asks, “Is there hate speech?” Yeah, there is. [audience laughing] Suck it up, buttercup. [audience laughing] “Are there any man-in-a-dress joke',\n",
              "  's?” Very few jokes. [audience laughing] If you’ve come to this film for a giggle, you’re gonna be very disappointed. [audience laughing] But this one takes the biscuit for me. Remember, this is a movie set in the 1940s, about, arguably, the worst atrocity in civilized human history. Check this out. “Is someone misgendered?” [audience laughing] Fucking hell. [woman 7] Oh shit! This is quite sweet. “Is there any antisemitism?” [laughs] Yeah. [audience laughing] This is pretty much the mother lode. Right? Forget Kanye. This… [audience laughing] This is off the fucking charts. Don’t do that when you’re talking about this. Fuck’s sake! [audience laughing] I was doing the graph. I was doing like that. This is off the charts. That’s… [laughs] Wouldn’t things have been different if that was Hitler’s salute? The whole thing would’ve been like, “It’s Hitler.” Like that. [audience laughing] Hiya. [Gervais laughing] This is interesting. “Does it have a sad ending?” Right? Someone says yes, and then someone else says no. And I thought about it. But then I remembered… If you’ve… If you’ve seen the film, if you remember, when the story sort of ends, Spielberg then tacks on a real bit of footage where he gets real-life descendants of people murdered in the Holocaust, and he films them coming into a Jewish cemetery, and they each leave a stone on the grave to represent their family members that were murdered. It builds up, and it’s very moving. So I think I get the ambiguity. “Does it have a sad ending?” Yes, in the sense that six million Jews pointlessly lost their life, but no, in the sense there was still enough left over to build a little rockery. So… [audience laughing] I asked one question myself on this. “Is James Corden in it?” [audience laughing] [audience cheering and clapping] I did, um, look at one other film, briefly. Uh, Titanic. Right? And it’s got all the same sort of questions. The one where it goes, “Are any animals harmed?” Someone answers, “There are no explicit scenes of animals being harmed, but Rose did have a goldfish, which probably didn’t make it.” [audience laughing] I think the goldfish in the bowl on the sideboard when the boat hits the iceberg, and he’s all like that. And people are running around going, “Ahh! We’re going in the water!” And he’s all smug then. And he’s going, “Don’t worry about it.” [audience laughing] “Oh no, not water.” [laughs] [audience laughing] Then he gets in the sea, and goes, “It’s very salty, innit? It’s very salty.” [audience laughing] [Gervais laughs] I’ll leave you with a true story. It’s still on the theme of “does the dog die?” When I was seven years old, my mum took me to the cinema to see a film called Old Yeller. Beautiful film. Yeah, made in the late ’50s. And sort of set in the Wild West on this homestead. And it’s about a… a kid who adopts this little junkyard dog. And he calls him Old Yeller, and they grow up together. And it’s a buddy movie. It’s a love story between this kid and his dog. Eventually, when the dog’s big, and, you know, he protects this kid in the wild, he fights a cougar, and a bear, and a wolf, or whatever. But towards the end of the film, the kid’s about 13, maybe, it takes a dark turn. I remember the kid sorta looking at Old Yeller who’s locked in the barn. And the mother’s suspicious, right? She goes, “Is Old Yeller all right?” “Yeah, he’s fine. He’s fine.” But the kid knows that he’s been bitten, right? And soon, Old Yeller starts foaming at the mouth and… [growls]…getting aggressive. And the mother turns up with a gun, and the kid goes, “No.” And she goes, “You know we’ve gotta do it.” He goes, “Yeah, but he’s my dog. I’ll do it.” And he shoots his own dog. And I was, like, in floods for like a year. Right? Anyway, fast-forward. A few years ago, I was on tour. I was on a train, and I get a text from Jane. She says, “Oh, I’m finally watching Old Yeller.” And I sent back, “Oh, enjoy.” Right? [audience laughing] I didn’t think, right? Twenty minutes later, I get a text. “Nothing happens to that dog, does it?” Oh, I couldn’t believe my',\n",
              "  ' fucking luck. I… [audience laughing] Oh, I thought she knew. So I sent back, “No, of course not.” [audience laughing] One hour later, I get a text, “You cunt!” [laughs] [audience laughing] [audience clapping] Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. Cheers. Thanks to everyone who bought a ticket. If you bought a platinum ticket, the money goes to an animal charity, and you’ve raised two million dollars so far. So thank you so much. [audience cheering and clapping] I even get a bit of stick about that on social media. There’s always someone who goes, “Oh, why do you only speak up for animals?” And I go, “Well, ’cause they haven’t got a voice of their own, except parrots.” Um, and that’s… I think that’s why we don’t eat parrots. Everyone around the world eats every other type of bird, don’t they? Everyone in the world eats fucking chickens, and ducks, and geese, and turkeys, and ostriches. No one eats parrots. Do you know why? If you go and try and eat a parrot, it goes, “Fuck off, you cunt.” [audience laughing] So speaking up really does work. Right? [audience cheers] And that has sort of been one of the themes of the show. ‘Cause I know, in the real world, in normal jobs and everyday life, you get in trouble. People tell you off for saying certain things, or thinking certain things, or even laughing at certain things, right? They say you’re bad for laughing at that. And some of you take it to heart. You go, “Oh my God. Am I a bad person?” No, you’re not. One, you can’t choose your sense of humor. You can’t. It’s involuntary. And two, that’s exactly what humor is for. To laugh at bad shit to get us through it. Right? And… Uh… [audience cheering and clapping] And we’ve established you can’t even choose your own thoughts. How often have you been on a train station and you’ve suddenly thought, “What if I just pushed that bloke?” And… [audience laughing] And then you go, “Why have I thought that?! Am I…” “Am I a psychopath?” No. You’re not. You’re the opposite. You’re a safe pair of hands. You’re testing yourself, you’re reminding yourself how terrible that’d be. You’re a good person, right? I don’t get that one. Um… What I get is, I’m talking to a really sweet old lady, and I suddenly start thinking, “What if I just spat in her face now?” Why would I… [audience laughing] [Gervais laughing] Another theme of the show has been, “words change, and I’m woke, ha-ha.” But here’s the irony. I think I am woke, but I think that word has changed. I think if woke still means what it used to mean, that you’re aware of your own privilege, you try and maximize equality, minimize oppression, be anti-racist, anti-sexist, anti-homophobic… Yes, I’m definitely woke. If woke now means being a puritanical, authoritarian bully, who gets people fired for an honest opinion or even a fact, then, no, I’m not woke. Fuck that. [audience cheering] [man 5 yelling] But here’s the deal. To each their own. Laugh at whatever you find funny. All laughter’s good, and you’re amazing. Good night.

Number one, I need you to treat women with respect always. Even if you think you’re right, be respectful. Number two, don’t mix white and dark liquor. That’s how you end up in the back of a police car. Speaking of which, get you a white friend. Black men with white friends are 38% less likely to be shot by the police. Are you listening? You just gonna stare at me. [baby cooing] You just gonna stare. That’s what you’re gonna do? This is serious stuff, man. I’m gonna put this on video for you, and when you’re old enough, you come back and watch it, deal? All right, deal. [audience cheering] Thank you, Frederick Douglass. [cheers and applause] But if we get rid of the Confederate flag… [laughter] [man] Yeah! …how am I gonna know who the dangerous white people are? I’m just saying, the flag had a couple upsides. Let’s just be real about it. I ain’t saying keep it around, but I grew up in the South. I can’t tell you how many times the Confederate flag came in handy. You stopping for gas at a strange place at 2:00 in the morning, you see that flag hanging from the window, you know this is not the place to get gas. And you keep it moving. What’s the rush to get rid of the flag? Especially if you white. If you white, you should want to keep the flag for a little while longer so at least black folks will know you cool. ‘Cause if you white and you not an asshole, that’s the one thing that helps us identify you. You get rid of that flag, we’ll be– Mm-mmm. We got to figure out a way to know who the cool white people– Cool white people, we just got to start giving y’all wristbands or handstamps. Just something you can show in a dark alley… let us know you down with the struggle. That’d be cool. “Give me your money, white dude!” Like, “Whoa, ahh, ahh, ahh!” “I’m so sorry, come on through. “Come– come on through. “No, they got the wristbands, they good. “Listen, put this wristband on. “This one over here, like– In case it go down, you wanna have that wristband on.” Atlanta, what’s going on? How y’all doing, man? Y’all good? [cheers and applause] Yeah, yeah. Thank you a lot, man. Love the South, man. I’m from Birmingham, man. It’s good ',\n",

I talked to my uncle about it. You know, my uncle. “First thing we need to do is get rid of the N-word.” My uncle don’t like the N-word, my Uncle Derek. Hate the N-word, be trying to– My uncle trying to quit the N-word the way people try to quit cigarettes, a little bit at a time. It’s a word. Ain’t no cravings. Either you say it or you don’t. My uncle be calling me every week with updates. “I only said it four times this week. “Mm-hmm. “Only said that four times. “Now, Sunday’s my cheat day, ’cause I watch football. “I got to say it. I got to say it on Sunday. “Grown man drop a first down, I got to call him the N-word. That’s just what it is.” And this is my thing with the N-word, like– Like, at this point, black folks, like, if we trying to get stuff done politically in this country– We inching, we doing, we inching, we inching, but at this point, I think it’s time for us to schedule a meeting with gay people, ’cause gay people get way more shit done than us. [applause] They don’t mess around. Gay people shut shit down. They want something to go away, it’s gone. They don’t fool around, man. Every week, it’s five, six new words you can’t call gay people. Black folks, we’ve been working on the N-word since 1804. We can’t get one word out the American vocabulary. Gay people up to 37 words. We need to go to Panera and have a meeting with gay people, and have a soup and salad and figure this out. Yeah, that’s how you figure out your issues, over soup and salad. You can’t even say “gay” no more. That’s how good gay people are. The only word left to address gay people by. You better not fumble that word in a sentence. That’s your ass. You use “gay” in the wrong context at work and see if you don’t have to go talk to Sylvia in HR. HR be on your ass immediately ’cause you mumbled “gay” one time the wrong way. You was by yourself when you said the shit and you still got in trouble. It’s not like you was walking through the cubicles telling gay jokes, you was… You was in the break room, you was alone, and your chips got stuck and you cussed. That don’t mean you a bad person, you was just hungry. You say',\n",
              "  ' anything when you’re hungry. Every man in this room, we’ve all been through it. Them chips get stuck at the top of the machine, and you try to jostle the machine a little bit.

Security to the break room, security to the break room.” And that’s it and you gone ’cause you called some chips gay. But that’s the power of the gay agenda. They figured out a way to influence the political process of this country to make sure that their issues are at least heard. Even if people don’t get the bills passed, they at least listen to ’em, and that’s what I’m trying to tell my uncle. You don’t like the N-word, man, you wanna get rid of the N-word, this all you gotta do. Start calling gay people n i g g a s. [laughter and applause] It’ll be gone tomorrow. Listen, I don’t like it either, all right, but that’s the best idea I got right now, okay? At least that’s what I’m gonna teach my son. I’m a father figure. I got to show him the right way. They try to divide us on television, you know. But there’s a lot of people that aren’t black that’s standing on the right side of issues that affect us. I appreciate those folks, you know. [applause] They don’t get highlighted enough. There’s plenty of people out there that care about black stuff. I done seen ’em, man. I went to– I went to a black history museum, I had a white tour guide. Hey, it threw me off for a second. I turned to the brother that was on the tour with me, I was like, “Is this the dude? He’s gonna do it?” It was a white dude, it was a white dude telling me about my shit. And he was good! Yeah, I was trying to hate on him. By the end of the tour, I was like, “Yo, bro, you did your thing, man. “Straight up, fam, you do what you do. “Hey, real quick, let me give you “one of these wristbands real quick. “Yeah, put that on. In case it go down, you want to wear that wristband.” I know some folks got a problem with that. You don’t want a white person at a black history museum, I understand that. Here’s the thing. I’m not saying they’re better than a black tour guide. I think a black tour guide at a civil rights museum, I think they’re better',\n",

You can’t walk around slavery all day for eight hours and not cuss at somebody. [cheers and applause] Somebody getting cussed. You gotta catch him at 9:00 a.m. He just finished that McGriddle. “How y’all doing? “My name is Charles, it’s my pleasure “to take you on this journey. “Look at these exhibits right here. “Black history is American history. Come look at the exhibits.” You think that brother gonna be in a good mood at 4:30, he been staring at slavery? That dude liable to cuss out everybody. “Look at this shit! “Come look what you done to us! “Come look what you done to us! “Look what you– Get your ass out my museum, motherfucker!” You go to the gift shop, it’s just people crying. That’s horrible. That’s scary. Something’s wrong, man. Just don’t be one of these people that’s surprised that black folks got issues. Them the people I can’t deal with. I’d rather talk to somebody that don’t agree with me than somebody that’s had they eyes closed. “Hey, did you know black people– Why are black people angry?” Motherfucker, we been angry. This ain’t new. You think this just happened last couple of years? Black folks been trying to tell y’all forever that they had some issues and we sat– We invented the blues! [laughter and applause] What more of a sign did you need? We literally invented an entire genre of music based on sadness, that’s how sad we were. And we– the blues was created here. That is an American art form. That is not native African– Go listen to old African music. The shit is happy ’cause we was free. [cheers and applause] Go back. Every old African song. ♪ We have freedom in Africa ♪\\n♪ Freedom in Africa ♪\\n♪ Freedom, got freedom in Africa ♪ Soon as we got off the slave ship.

You couldn’t possibly expect that level of patriotism from a race of people that have had so many issues, you can’t. It’s not realistic. Black people don’t– We don’t sing about America. We sing about specific cities where you can have a good-ass time. That’s what we do. We don’t talk about the country. We can tell you where the party at, though. We can do that. Look, I can’t tell you nothing about America, but let me tell you about the city where the heat is on all night on the beach ’til the early morn. Welcome to Miami, that’s where you got to go. You ever been to California? Oh, my God, boy, you got to go down to California, boy. Boy, California knows how to party. The city of L.A., the city of good ol’ Watts and the city of Compton. They keep it rockin’. Write that shit down, I’m trying to tell you. They keep it rockin’. Black people don’t do patriotism. Maybe “Georgia on My Mind.” That’s the closest we probably come. Maybe that, maybe that. That’s a good song, it’s warm, it’s about the country. Ray Charles, “Georgia on My Mind,” good song. But… the key word in that song is “on my mind.” Ray Charles was just thinking about Georgia. He didn’t tell you to go there. Georgia’s like every other part of the South. It’s got some pockets you should not be in after dark. If you’d have asked Ray Charles to be more specific on where in Georgia to go, he’d have said to go to Atlanta where the players play and they ride in them thangs like every day.

It’s the opposite. It’s a secret message to black people. James Brown is one of the most masterful musicians to ever walk this earth, dude. It’s a brilliant song. [cheers and applause] That song ain’t got nothing to do with America. That entire song, “Livin’ in America” is a secret message to black folks. All you gotta do, listen to the end of the song. Very end of “Livin’ in America,” all James Brown do is just start naming cities. That’s it, end of the song. ♪ Livin’ in America ♪\\n♪ New Orleans, Detroit City ♪\\n♪ Dallas, Pittsburgh ♪\\n♪ Kansas City, Atlanta ♪ He just naming safe places for black folks. That’s– that’s it. Love black music, man. Hits you, you know. That’s why I have– That’s why I have a hard time going to see civil rights movies. I have to go see civil right movies in the middle of the day so nobody can see me crying. ‘Cause them movies be hitting you, man. Civil rights movies get me with that Negro humming. Oh, my God, I break down. ‘Cause you know, every civil rights movie just got that scene where it’s just some humming. ♪ Freedom ♪ [humming] You tell me that don’t break you down, in the middle of a civil rights movie, just that humming? There don’t even be nothing serious happening on screen, I be crying. It’s just a dude putting butter on a waffle, and just… [humming] ♪ Freedom ♪ [humming continues] You be in the theater bawling. “He was just putting butter on the waffle! They wouldn’t let him, they wouldn’t let him.” Civil rights movies get me all the time, man. They get me with that humming, and then they always make black people fall in slow motion. Yo, every civil rights movie, a black person fall in slow– Why you got to slow down my pain? Just play it at regular speed. Any time a black person falls in a civil rights movie',\n",
              "  ', they fall, then they do that double bounce in the dirt and the dirt come up. “Get out of here, darkie! Just get out!” “Ohhh!” Pfft! Pfft! [cheers and applause] Don’t do that to me. Most powerful civil rights movie scene of all time is Selma. I can name the scene. It’s when Oprah Winfrey got slapped. This dude slapped the fire– It was the second time, not the first time she got slapped, the second time. This dude slapped Oprah Winfrey so hard, she fell in slow motion and there was Negro humming. I left the theater. I couldn’t even tell you how the movie ended. It was too powerful. My emotions. First of all, Oprah couldn’t have known she was getting slapped. She didn’t know. She didn’t know she was getting slapped. That dude– That was Ava DuVernay, that was the director, she made that choice. That’s a good-ass director, Ava DuVernay went up to that actor between scenes. “Okay, we love what you’re doing, okay? “We’re getting a lot of good stuff from you. “We’re just gonna change it up this scene. “Okay, this time, this time, “Oprah’s gonna come over, okay? “She’s gonna do her lines, and Oprah, “she finishes her lines, you slap the shit out, just– slap Oprah.” “Does Oprah know?” “No, do what I tell you! I’m Ava DuVernay! Slap Oprah!” Oprah came over to that dude, man. You could see it in her face. She didn’t know that– that slap was coming. “We ain’t leaving till we get our rights.” Skaboom! ♪ Oh, freedom ♪ [humming] Pfft! Pfft! The thing about this country is this: We’re all Americans. People love to say that. That’s the first thing people want to say when– when there’s some tension. “Oh, we’re all Americans. “You’re American and I’m American. “Well, just, hell, we all Americans. Can’t we just be all Americans?” Yeah, we are. We all Americans. But we live in two different Americas. That’s what it is. People forget that. And I don’t think everybody that… doesn’t understand what we go through is necessarily racist or bigoted. That’s– That’s a far jump. It’s a lot of folks that just straight up don’t know what it’s like. And you gotta educate ’em. You gotta educate ’em on the kind of America you live in. I had to go Best Buy and give a dude some straightening. Straighten his ass out, yeah. I’m straightening. Dude at Best Buy gonna decide I don’t need a bag with m',\n",

I need that in a bag. “What do you need a bag for? “I don’t understand why you need a bag. “It’s wasteful. Recycle. Don’t you care about the Earth?” I go, “Sir, this has nothing to do with the Earth. “I’m a black man in America. I gotta leave this store with a bag, bro.” [cheers and applause] It’s about safety. I’m black, I don’t get the luxury of just walking out with shit in my hand. That is a roll of the dice. That is a horrifying day if I– No, not only do I need that bag, bitch, I need that receipt! And staple it to the outside. I don’t want a receipt in my hand. You staple my receipt to the outside like Chinese carryout, and I’ll hold it up in the air, I’ll “Lion King”– I’ll “Hakuna Matata” an iPhone case out of Best Buy. And it’s not his fault. He just didn’t understand. He thought he was saving the Earth, but he was saving a life, that’s what he was doing. This has nothing to do with recycling, man. ‘Cause, see, you might be a cool person. He might– The cashier might be a cool-ass dude, but we don’t know what the security guard been through up front. I come prancing out of Best Buy with this naked-ass iPhone case in my hand. And here comes security. “Excuse me, sir. Did you pay for that?” Oh, yeah, I got the receipt. “He’s going for a gun!” Skaboom! ♪ Oh, freedom, ohh ♪ Pfft! Pfft! [cheers and applause] Everything ain’t racism. About 2%, it’s about 2%… that ain’t racism. You gotta recognize that 2% when you see it. I was in McDonald’s, this dude was cussing everybody out. Swore it was racism. I walked in this fast food spot, this dude cussing everybody out. And this is the thing, like, fast food spots already do shady stuff, so I’m not saying they don’t deserve to be cussed out. They do, they deserve a good cussing every now and then, ’cause the thing they do now, some of these fast food spots, they love to charge you for sauce when you get nuggets. [audience murmurs] You know, you want an extra sauce with your nuggets, it’s gonna be– “Oh, you want another sauce, brother, it’s gonna be 25 cents.” How you charging for sauce, bro? That’s– I want two sauces. “Well, I need a quarter.” You ever meet the Guardian of the Sauce? Thi',\n",
              "  's dude is serious. Done got a different color shirt from everybody else at work, so now he arrogant. “Well, you know, brother, I’m a supervisor now. “I have a shirt on. You know, if it was up to me, I would give you another sauce.” It is up to you! It’s on your side of the counter! I just want two sauces without paying for ’em, that’s all I want. But I walked in this spot, man, this dude was cussing out the whole store. Swore it was racism. And I’m not saying that racism wasn’t one of the causes for him getting bad service, I’m just saying, he jumped to that conclusion a little fast. He didn’t go through the progressions. He ordered a six-piece nugget, and it was five nuggets in the box. And I didn’t even know what was going on. I’m texting, as soon as I walk in the door, I’m texting, I hear this dude, I hear this dude over in the cut, I hear this dude go, “I’ll kill everybody in this bitch.” [laughter and applause] You know, that– that gave me pause, ’cause he said he’ll kill everybody in this bitch. And I already had a foot in the door. Am I technically in this bitch, sir? ‘Cause I can pull this foot out and go to Arby’s. It ain’t that deep. Swore it was racism, man. “Y’all stole my nugget. I’m tired of white folks.” “White folks don’t want us to have shit! Stole my nugget!” Then he gonna turn to me. “You see this shit, brother? You see this McDonald’s? “It’s our nuggets today. It’s our children’s nuggets tomorrow.” “If I was white, I’d have got seven nuggets.” That’s when I backed off. I’m like, I can’t help this dude. I’m like, look, bro, I know you mad and there’s a lot of racial tension in the world, but this ain’t racism. This is a fast food spot at 2:00 in the morning. Some of them folks back there can’t count to six. You want six nuggets, you need to order a four-piece and two-piece. That’s how you trick they ass and get two sauces for free. [cheers and applause] [chuckles] I like fast food employees. I appreciate the fact that fast food employees are rude. I like it. At least it’s from the heart. ‘Cause people too nice now. You go out to these stores, everybody, “Hey, how you doing? Are you good? Thank you for choosing us.” You think them people wanna be your friend, or they’ll get fired for not speaking? Which one you think it is? ‘Cause 10, 15 yea',\n",
              "  'rs ago, nobody spoke to you when you went in the store. Now, all of a sudden, everybody wanna kick it with your ass? No! That’s a corporate mandate, and I’d rather you not do it. I get in the grocery store. It’s just too many questions at the register. Just ring up the shit that’s on the belt. We ain’t gotta be friends. I’m here, I’m spending money, you won. What else do you want? Why I gotta be your friend, too, man?” The price you pay for politeness is your time. So you want somebody to be nice to you? That’s cool, enjoy it, but I’d rather get them minutes back with somebody I know. I don’t need all this politeness, man, I’m cool. ‘Cause people overdo it. I went on a cruise. This is the weirdest thing ever, man. You go on a cruise, you meet every employee. [scattered laughs] Yeah, you been– yeah. Every– You go on a cruise– I met the captain of the boat. The captain of the cruise ship does laps around the boat every day speaking to people. That’s too much. I have no need to meet you, sir. Listen, there’s no– At no point in my vacation do I need to meet the highest-ranking officer on the boat. I don’t need to– to do that. I’m at the pool, here come the captain. He’s got his stupid jacket on. He’s sashaying around there. “Welcome aboard, I am the captain, yes. “We are having pleasure, We are in ocean and we have pleasure.” He’s got them stupid medals dangling off his jacket. Took heavy fire in Cozumel. I don’t know how he got ’em, but he’s got… “We are having fun in the ocean. Sir, are you having fun?” Bitch, who driving? It’s too much. You go on a cruise, it makes you appreciate airline pilots. I respect airline pilots. Airline pilots ain’t got no chitchat for you, no small talk before the flight. You don’t even meet ’em. That’s the flight attendant’s job. You get on the plane, who you see first? It’s the flight attendant. “Welcome aboard, how are you? Walk in this way…” Captain ain’t got time to talk to your goofy ass. You get on the plane, look in the cockpit, what you see? Two alcoholics checking buttons, that’s all you see. What’s that, two grown-ass men, just… “Did you check all the buttons? “Okay, you can check the buttons up here “and then you check the buttons down here. “Okay, just– don’t– just check– start over. “Ladies and gentlemen, there’s gonna ',\n",
              "  'be a slight delay. “Uh… gotta recheck all these buttons. Thank you for choosing–” [imitates static] That’s it, that’s the captain’s job, to come over the intercom, let you know what’s happening. That’s it. No jokes, all business. That’s why they pause the movie, they stop serving drinks, ’cause the captain got important shit to say. “Ladies and gentlemen, this is the captain. “We about to go up in the sky, so sit that ass down “so we can get up there. “If something go wrong, talk to them heifers in the back. “I can’t help your ass, ’cause I’m up here, “I’m trying to fly this bitch. “So don’t you come up here. “My door’s locked. I got a shotgun. Fuck with us. Thank you for choosing–” [imitates static] [cheers and applause] The captain is all business, and I respect that. He’s all business until the plane lands. That’s when he know it’s time to get some respect from y’all. The captain knows that he did some dope shit, and he wants you to know he did some dope shit. “I just flew you 500 miles an hour “at 30,000 feet, I landed this flight “in a 50-mile-an-hour crosswind on the first attempt. I want you to know who your God is.” [laughter and applause] Yeah, the captain want his respect. That’s why when you get off the plane, the captain be standing in the door like a boss, like, “What’s up?” Copilot be next to him, like… You can’t do nothing but show love to the captain. I’m like, yo, bro, you did your thing, man. You flew that plane. Real quick, let me give you one of these wristbands. Gonna put that on. In case it jump off, wear your wristband. I’m trying to lose weight. It’s hard, man. Losing weight, they tell you everything you need to know about losing weight except for how much it’s gonna cost. But it’s hard when it’s time to lose weight. Drinking all these damn smoothies. And they expensive– five, six damn dollars for fruit and ice in a cup, how? How, Sway, how, how? How is it five, six damn dollars for fruit and ice in a cup? And they trick you with smoothies, they try to trick us, ’cause they put all them little extra words and adjectives in the name of the smoothie. Don’t fall for it.

You know, and I don’t know who to go celebrate with. This my thing about divorce. What I love about divorce, I love how people won’t shut the hell up about they wedding, but they divorce is none of your business. That’s not cool. You running your mouth all this time about your engagement, y’all break up, what happened? I wanna know, tell me what happened. Especially if I went to the wedding. If I went to your wedding and you divorced, I’m entitled to a one-page explanation, much money as I spent. Either you tell me why y’all getting divorced or you give me back the toaster I bought your ass. It’s a good-ass toaster. That’s four-slice with the crumb tray, that’s top-shelf. With a bagel button. You all know about that bagel button, that’s for ballers. My Uncle Derek told me to watch Titanic. “You want to learn how to woo a woman, you got to watch ‘Titanics.'” Country for you, “Titanics.” “You don’t know how to woo a woman, boy. “I’m telling you, ‘Titanics’ show you. “That boy Leo DiCaprio, boy, that boy got that girl, boy, “and that girl was out of his league, he pulled her. “And then he died, he died happy. “He was smiling when he was drowning. He float down smiling.” I went back and watched Titanic. Titanic is not that romantic of a movie. It’s a good film, but it ain’t romantic. Titanic is basically a movie about an old lady who got some dick so good… that she went back out into the ocean to say good-bye to it. [laughter] That’s pretty much the movie. Go back and watch Titanic. The whole thing is a flashback. It’s a 90-year-old la\",\n",

Give me the jewelry.” She threw that jewelry into the water. Titanic ain’t no romantic movie. If anything, it’s a superhero movie. It’s a superhero movie. Leo DiCaprio is a superhero, bro. They had sex one time in that movie. Once. They had sex one time in Titanic. And she remembered it for the next 70 years. [laughter and applause] You know how good your pipe game got to be? To put it down once, one time, and for 70 years, that’s all she can think about. She’s 90. Think about how much stuff you probably will forget. I know by the time I’m 90, I’m not gonna where my– I’m not gonna know where my car is parked, I’m not gonna know my grandkids’ names. I’m gonna have my pills in that Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday trapdoor. But this lady is 90 and she never forgot that one time– His dick beat Alzheimer’s. That’s a superpower. You gotta respect that. I like old people, man. I hope– I hope I’m blessed enough to– to live long, change the diet up, add a couple years on the back end. You know. Old people, I just– I want to get to that age where I can just cuss people out for no reason. You know what I’m saying? Just unprovoked cussed-outs. Yeah, she already smiling. You almost there? You got… No, ’cause you look a little young. You got a little more time, but you just– You already trained, you already cuss people now.

This dude called me motherfucker and got free groceries. That’s how much he put in work. Like, I know I’m not gonna get that same result. Like, I wish I could, but I know I’m not, I’m– ‘Cause the thing is that you start reflecting, you start reflecting on what you’ve done that compares to that and I look at the things that I try to do now. Like, I try my best to be socially active. I try my best to do stuff on “The Daily Show” that affects change, I try. [cheers and applause] But… I’ll be real, a lot of what I do now is just making up for lost time, ’cause I wasn’t always like that, and that’s something I’m ashamed about.

              " ['In this stand-up comedy show, Sammy Obeid reflects on his unexpected realization that he might not align with the traditional definition of a liberal, humorously questioning political and social identities. Drawing from his experiences at UC Berkeley, known for its progressive stance, he jests about the impact of his education on his worldview. Obeid humorously navigates through topics like race, political correctness, and his Palestinian-American heritage, using comedy as a tool to dissect the complexities of these subjects. He also delves into the nature of comedy itself, suggesting that feeling offended is a natural human reaction and criticizing the prevailing cancel culture and the pressures on comedians to challenge societal norms. Concluding his routine, Obeid muses on personal growth and the transformative power of comedy to tackle serious issues while maintaining a humorous and self-deprecating approach. Recorded on February 2, 2022\\nPremiered on YouTube, July 8, 2022 * * * Recently, I discovered that I’m not a liberal. What? Yeah, I didn’t know. I thought I was liberal my whole life, and then I looked up the definition and realized I need to check definitions first before saying that I’m something. Anybody here identify as a liberal? Okay, a couple of people. After knowing you’re walking into this joke, uh, this blew my mind. This is the definition of liberal: a liberal is somebody who accepts and respects behavior and points of view different from yours. Do you know anybody fucking like that? One person. The last one we had was Jesus, and we killed him. Luther King, and we killed him. We’re just killing all the good liberals. Why are we killing all the liberals, man? Every liberal I know thinks they’re smarter than at least one person, right? You can’t be accepting of others and superior to them at the same time. We need to change that name from liberal to bigots who believe in global warming. Okay? [Applause] [Music] [Applause] Hello, I don’t know if you can tell, but we got like 10 cameras tonight, just in case nine of them fail. Uh, this is my second comedy special. Um, yeah, my first one was also here, and I know somebody’s gonna be like, “Why’d you do it again here?” Because this is the only place where people will come, so, um, so we’re doing it here. I was getting into a really heated debate about, uh, race with my friend, uh, because it was 9 a.m., and my friend hi',\n",
              "  't me with the classic, you know, “Sammy, I don’t see color.” I was like, “That’s crazy because I don’t hear sound. I don’t smell smells. I don’t taste food. I have COVID, is what I’m saying. I have COVID. That’s how you know I’m not racist. COVID down took all my senses. I know COVID is a dark topic and people have lost their lives, but maybe that’s why COVID was put on this planet, to take away all our discerning senses so we can stop being fucking bigots to each other, you know what I mean? You can’t hate someone you can’t smell, you know. You can probably tell by my first two jokes that I went to school at UC Berkeley. Yeah, yeah, go Bears. I graduated UC Berkeley. That just means I get offended at everything. Don’t fucking test me, I’ll cry right here and prove my point. There’s a nickname they give people who went to Berkeley. They call us pussies. Uh, yeah, I thought it was “Go Bears.” Apparently, it’s “Go Pussies.” If you look at our mascot up close, it’s just a bear going “rear.” It’s international, too. I went to France. I told the guy he’s like, “Oh, you went to Berkeley. You’re a pussy.” Like, that’s not nice. Didn’t know how deep this pussy snub goes, but Berkeley, we do serve a function in society. We’re here to show you where the line could be. You know, we always have social issues and people like, “Where’s the line?” Berkeley is like, “It’s over here. It’s definitely not over there. It’s definitely not over there.” Thank you, Berkeley, for letting us know that it’s not over there. For instance, two years ago, the city of Berkeley unanimously voted to change the name of manholes to gender-neutral maintenance holes. That was us, baby. That was us. You’re welcome, society. Gender-neutral maintenance holes. Take notes. You thought you were cool because you’re neutral restroom signs. We brought equality to the source, okay? That’s Berkeley. We’re different. Yeah, and nowadays, society thinks they’re all cool because they’re woke, right? But who do you think taught you that shit? Berkeley was woke before people were woke to woke, dude. Berkeley don’t bend woke. We woke up like this. Yeah, and of course, Berkeley always receives the same critique: “Oh, you guys embrace all points of view, except conservative.” That’s not true. Berkeley has Republicans. They’re just, like, different, you know? Our Republicans are like Alaska Native Republicans, you know, or like trans-Republ',\n",
              "  'icans, like, “Hi, I’m a Berkeley Republican. I believe in low taxes and I identify as ooh-la-la.” That’s pretty cool. We have computer science majors who are non-binary, programming in binary code. Okay, we are different. I told the guy I went to Berkeley, he’s like, “Oh, you went to Berkeley. You must like safe spaces.” That one hurt, right here, because like, I do, you know? Like, who doesn’t like a safe space? I love safe spaces, like, I like my bed with no spikes, you know? I like to eat when no mountain lions are around. Who else? Who doesn’t like safety? So, I had to tell that guy, I was like, “Yo, dude, what you’re doing is called negative association,” which I actually learned in a Berkeley philosophy class. I was like, “You’re taking what you know about safe spaces and what you know about people who go to Berkeley and you’re linking the two under a logical fallacy, and you are wrong, my friend.” Dropped my number two pencil, walked out of there, and he was like, “Whatever, pussy.” And I went home and I looked it up, and Berkeley did invent the safe space in 1968. Damn it! How did this guy know? Berkeley had the first safe space in 1968 during the Free Speech Movement, and you know what the purpose of that safe space was? The safe space was so that people could have an area where they could save whatever they wanted and be protected under the First Amendment. Does that sound like a pussy thing, or is that the most badass American thing you ever heard? Okay? So I was scrolling this list of Berkeley’s inventions and crying, and I discovered that Berkeley invented some profound stuff that changed humanity that I’m now just gonna take some credit for even though I had nothing to do with it. So, here’s Berkeley’s list of badass pussy inventions, okay? Number one: The flu vaccine was not invented at Berkeley, but the guy who invented it had his lab at Berkeley after inventing it, where he popped some champagne and did some experimental stuff that revolutionized the landscape of vaccine technology today. And I don’t know if you guys, you know, pay attention to the news, but vaccines… pretty fucking popular right now. You know what I mean? And yeah, vaccines are kind of a pussy invention if you think about it. It’s like, “I don’t want to get sick, poke.” You know? Yeah, so you’re welcome for your parents still being alive, or sorry, depending on how you feel about them. But… Uh, Ber',\n",
              "  'keley invented the wetsuit. Yeah, anybody here surf? Yeah, you’re welcome for the warmth, pussy. Before us, people were just jumping in the water and dying of hypothermia, and then someone from Berkeley was like, “Oh, you don’t like being chilly, do you? You probably want to put on some spandex so when you pee on your thigh, it gets warm, like, gnarly, dude.” Berkeley invented the world’s first no-fault divorce law. Yeah, before that, it was always your fault divorce. People couldn’t see their kids without giving up their left kidney, and then someone from Berkeley was like, “Oh, someone doesn’t want to lose half their shit.” And now, thanks to Berkeley, you can be friends with all your exes, like Drake. Uh, next invention, um, the atom bomb. No one ever claps for that, for some reason. Um, guess we’re in the wrong state. The atom bomb was invented by the Manhattan Project, which couldn’t have been possible without two critical papers, one from the University of Chicago and the other one from the University of pussy California, Berkeley. That was us, that was us. Of course, the atom bomb is a pussy invention, right? It’s like, “Hey, country I don’t like, am I going to fight? Nope, just going to press this button.” That was us, dude. And I get it, nobody’s going to go crazy for the atom bomb, but you do know the atom bomb is what makes America fucking America, dude. Like, who remembers two years ago when we were about to go to World War III with Iran? Remember that? The good part of 2020, right at the beginning, like, if Trump says one more fucking thing, we’re all gone. Does anybody remember right now with Russia and Ukraine, or like, if Biden reads that teleprompter wrong, we’re gone! Dude, the United States has been on the brink of World War III every year since 1945, but not one person in this room is scared. You’ve never flinched even once because you know we’re fucking America, dude. Why? Because we’re number one, bro. Why are you number one? Because we got the biggest, most powerful nuclear artillery in the world, brother. We got the longest, most phallic-looking warheads, dude, ready to penetrate any thirsty country who wants some. And we got the biggest nuclear button, dude. Yeah, it’s like eight inches erect, it’s earthy, it’s hard as a math problem, just like, “Press me, daddy. Press me, press me, daddy. Press me.” You take those big ol’ American fingers swooping down like',\n",
              "  ' a bald eagle and boom! Giving the world multiple nuclear orgasms. And you get a climax, and you get a climax, and you get a climax, and you get a climax. Thanks to those fucking pussies in Berkeley, turned America into a goddamn safe space. You’re welcome for the vaccines, you pussies. Really, I’ve been called a pussy my whole life. Growing up, everybody would call me a pussy, and you know what? I like it. I fucking love being called a pussy, dude. Pussy is the best thing on the planet. It’s the most sought-after resource known to humankind. It’s strong, it’s durable, it’s temperature modulated. It’s the thing people have done the most extreme shit for that they should regret, but they don’t because they did it for the pussy, you know what I’m saying? It’s the source of all life. We all came from a pussy. It’s technically a gender-neutral maintenance hole. We all slid out a pussy. Man, it’s the first thing you tasted when you entered this planet. Oh, swallow it. This is facts. This is a clean joke. You’re making it dirty in your head. That’s your bad. I love being called a pussy. You call me a pussy, I get wet, dude. Yeah, yeah, I got a dry sense of humor. I’m a dry-ass pussy, okay? I’m a DAP. Yeah, I’m pretty smart. I’m a smart-ass pussy. I’m a SAP. Okay, I’m a smart Lebanese ass pussy. I’m a SLAP. You get me? I’m a proud ass pussy who likes bagels. I’m a PAP smear. That’s my last one. Read my labias. I’m pussy and proud, and if you got a problem with that, you can beat this pussy. [Applause] I just said pussy 50 times. Some of you are uncomfortable. I can sense it. You feel like that word’s dirty or something like that. You always have male comics up here talking about their dicks. Why not just, you know, flip it for a minute, right? Because it is the year of the tiger, and what is the tiger but the biggest pussy of them all? Nobody rolls up to a tiger like, “Hey, tiger, you’re such a pussy.” Tiger just mauls your ass right there. Just gives you whiplash. Pap! Now you’re pussy-whipped. 2022 is the year of the pussy. It’s my year. Rare. That’s how the tiger sounds, right? Rare. I think that’s how a tiger sounds. This guy’s not laughing at all. Fuck that shit, man. Not liking these pussy jokes. Math jokes! Math jokes? Fuck that. We’re not there yet, bro. Gotta go in order, my dog… Actually, I mean, I have gotten shit for this joke already. A woman in the audience one time was like,',\n",
              "  ' “You’re mansplaining pussy to us.” First of all, you’re assuming I identify as a man. I don’t. I identify as OOH LA LA. Secondly, I would never pretend to understand what a woman goes through, but I’ll tell you this much: you may have a pussy, but you’ve never been called one like I have, okay? This is my term right now. Let me have my moment. Yeah, I’m a clean comic, by the way. Um, this has all been clean material. I know, I don’t even say the word masturbation. I don’t. I don’t like the word masturbation. It just sounds too formal. I don’t say masturbating. I say listening to Jack Johnson. Way better, dude. Way better. That’s a dick joke by a pussy. Yes, I majored in applied mathematics. That’s why I do stand-up comedy now, okay? Is that what you want to hear? Look, I’m not the best mathematician in the world. Otherwise, I wouldn’t be doing comedy. And I’m not the best comedian in the world because, otherwise, I wouldn’t be here. It’s no slight to you. I just wouldn’t be most places, if you think about it statistically. Not the best mathematician. I’m not the best comedian, but if you take the weighted average, I’m the best fucking math comic out there, baby. I’m not going to make you laugh the hardest, and I’m not the quickest to solve problems, but if you set a maximization equation across both of those parameters and you look at the curve, I’m the fucking apex, biatch. Yeah, and I assure you, I’m the only comedian with that punchline in history. I’m the fucking apex, biatch. Yeah. I say biatch. I don’t say the B word anymore because I know people do find that offensive. I say biatch because it’s clean. It’s one letter away from Biotech. We’re fine. That’s science, biatch! So, math major turned comedian. I don’t really know how I’m helping the world. Uh, I don’t know what I’m supposed to do as a math major turned comedian, other than share the gems that I think of in the middle of the night. Like, this morning, I woke up in a cold sweat like, “Oh my God. Pete Davidson was only eight years old when Kim’s sex tape came out.” Back to sleep. You’re welcome, society. Took a Berkeley degree to write that. When I studied math, I made sure not to go too deep into the math world because if you learn too much math, you can’t talk to people anymore. So, I had to cut myself off. So, for instance, when I learned pi, I stopped myself at 10 digits. Yeah, yeah. Because I actually discovered a',\n",
              "  ' formula when I was at Berkeley that for every extra digit of pi you learn, that’s one year your virginity is delayed. So, I had to cut myself off at 10. I could actually prove this theorem right now. I can prove it. You guys want a mathematical proof? We learn pie geometry sophomore year when most of us are about 15 years old. Hormones are raging. If you can’t even learn a single digit of pie, you don’t even remember that it starts with a three. When you’re 15 years old, it’s because you’re already having sex. That’s the only possible reason. This guy knows what I’m talking about, okay? But the average person learns three digits of pie. The average person knows it’s 3.14. Congratulations, you’re average. And what’s your reward for being average? You get to lose your virginity at the average age of 18. Okay, you already noticed a linear trend here. We got 15 plus 3 equals 18, right? I know you don’t come to comedy shows to do math, but when you watch my set, you ain’t got no fucking choice, okay? Now, if you’re learning more than three digits of pi, you’re losing your virginity in college. There’s no way. There’s no one that’s seen your problem who’s like, “Three went four one five.” Like, you’re going home, bro. It’s not happening tonight. If you learn more than seven, Master’s. Okay? If you learn more than 10, PhD. I have a friend who knows 100 digits of pi. Still a virgin, okay? Now, I… I learned 10 digits of pi like a badass, okay? So, I lost my virginity at… Plug it into the formula: 15 plus 10 equals 20 fucking five. Not 27, bro. 10 plus 15 is 25, my friend. You added an extra two. What kind of loose do you think I am, bro? 25, not 27. 27, I’d be off my family’s health insurance at that point, bro. I’m not an idiot. So, I lost my virginity at… Plug it into the formula: 15 plus 10 equals 20 fucking five. Who’s the pussy now? 25 is the best age to lose your virginity. I lost my virginity in a rental car that I rented myself, okay? [Applause] You thought you were boss because you lost in mommy civic. I declined insurance on a Hertz, biatch! They cleaned up the mess. I just walked away like a champ. Three one four one five nine two six five three one four one five nine two six five. It’s actually a phone number in St. Louis. I text it every day. Still no response. Isn’t that crazy? Somebody in Missouri has the phone number of pi, but they’re in Missouri, so they have no idea. You ',\n",
              "  'wanted the math jokes. Not even paying attention, man. What the fuck, dude? Requesting shit. Not a jukebox up here, dude. So, yes, I’m a comedian now. And I recently got the most interesting compliment I’ve ever got in comedy. After a show, a guy comes up to me, and he was drunk. I knew he was drunk because he was angled backwards at like 35 degrees, and he just walked out to me. He’s like, “Carlin, Pryor, Chappelle, you’re right up here with them, brother.” And I was like, “Oh, that’s so awesome. Thank you so much. This was just a 15-minute set. You should come see my full hour.” He’s like, “No, this was enough,” and then he walked away. That’s where I’m at in comedy right now. You’re here for a special moment. Um, I am an American comedian. I’m Palestinian-American. Thank you so much. I’m openly Palestinian. I was closeted for 30 years and then finally came out last year with the hadiths because they made Twitter a safe space, and I love safe spaces. Americans still don’t know a lot about Palestinians, and I guess it makes sense because there hasn’t been too many famous ones in history. And I guess the ones who are famous, people just don’t know who they are. Um, famous Palestinians: Yasser Arafat and Jesus. Who are those guys? Oh, and DJ Khaled. DJ Khaled is ours. DJ Khaled is ours. Isn’t that crazy? Those are the two most famous Palestinians in history. Jesus and DJ Khaled. They’re very similar. Jesus didn’t need a college when you think about it. In fact, when they came out with the New Testament, they were like, “Another one. We’re the best, baby. Christians. We don’t pass.” People always ask me, “What is it that the Palestinians want?” And I’ll tell you right now, it’s very simple. They want the right of return to their homeland that many of them left circa 1948. It’s called right of return. Those are the only three words you need to know. And there’s one country blocking it from happening, and it happens to be the country we’re in. The country that I love, the country that took my virginity, bless you. The country that my school protected with the nukes is the one vetoing Palestine from being recognized and not having the right of return to their homeland. And it’s hard to make jokes about this. It’s conflicting. I put one on YouTube. I said, “Of course, the United States is not going to support Palestinian right of return because if we did, we’d suddenly owe Native American',\n",
              "  's a country, right?” Joke did about the same on YouTube. Of course, a lot of angry people commenting. One guy was fuming. He was… He wrote in all caps. Uh, either he was angry or his caps lock button was broken. I admit, it could be either situation. Sees my right of return video and he comments, “I hope you go back to where you came from.” I was like, “This guy gets it.” [Laughter] [Applause] All right. Being Palestinian-American, less of an identity, more of an identity crisis. My dad was born a few hours out of Jerusalem. My mom was born in Utah. So, both places where Jesus got resurrected. Now, my great-grandma was born in Bethlehem, and I tell people this, they’re like, “Oh, Bethlehem, Pennsylvania?” I’m like, “Yeah, that’s the one. She was Amish. She grew up in the Holy Land next to Scranton. She knew the three wise men from Dunder Mifflin, come on! The birthplace of our savior, Bethlehem, P.A.” Now, everybody knows Bethlehem, birthplace of Jesus, the savior of most people in this country. Yet, if you ask most people in this country to point it out on a map, they’re pointing to Pennsylvania, there’s a problem. But it’s not our fault. It’s a very difficult geopolitical question. I had to look it up just for this joke. Yeah, my niece asked me over Christmas. My niece is five years old. She said, “Where’s Jesus from?” I was like, “Bethlehem. Nailed it, right?” She was like, “Where’s Bethlehem?” I was like, “Oh shit, here we go. I gotta give her the simplest answer you can a five-year-old, but I also gotta keep it real, you know?” So I was like, “Okay, um, well, technically, Bethlehem is in Palestine, but America, we don’t recognize Palestine as a country, so technically it’s in the Palestinian territories, um, specifically the West Bank, not the Gaza Strip. It was part of Israel, but they handed over to the Palestinian National Authority in 1995 under the interim agreement of 7.5 section 2 of the U.N. resolution at the Oslo Accords. Thanks, Bill Clinton. Uh, this was pre-Monika, never mind. Uh, but of course, before that, it was British Mandate Palestine, and before that, the Ottoman Empire, and before that, a conquest during the Crusades, and before that, another conquest, and before then, another conquest. Before that, another conquest. Ah, times back then, people were crazy. Before that, the Roman Empire, because it was the law. Uh, before that, Judea, shout out to my Zionists',\n",
              "  '. Uh, before that, the Canaanites. Yes, we Canaanites is what they did. Not say. I made that up, um, uh, before that, random tribes from Africa. Uh, Black Lives Matter. And uh, before that, it was the dinosaurs, if you believe in those, believe that they teach you those? And of course, before all of that, it was just lots and lots and lots of rocks. Uh, which, as we know, belonged to the Palestinians. Now, one could argue that it still is in Israel, technically, because Israel technically occupies the West Bank. But of course, Israel would say that’s not the case because that’s illegal under international law, under many, many counts. Don’t tell the U.N.! JK, they already know. Oh my god, it’s a mess. Everybody knows, literally everybody knows, except most of the people in the country that could actually vote to stop it. God bless Pennsylvania. Merry Christmas.” And that was the answer that I gave her in about 90 seconds flat, if you ever wanted to know where Bethlehem is. And I think she liked it because she immediately responded with, “Is Santa Claus real?” I said, “100% Santa Claus was real. We definitely recognize Santa Claus.” She’s like, “What are you getting me for Christmas?” I said, “I gave you the gift of Palestine. What do you want? Like, people usually pay to see my shows. I gave it to you free of charge.” She was like, “Free Palestine.” I was like, “Exactly!” I knew this was a safe space. As you can imagine, um, these jokes don’t do well all over the country. I did that bit not too long ago, and a guy comes up to me after and he’s like, “Hey buddy, let me give you some advice.” I’m like, “Oh, this is going to be good. This is why we do it. We come for the laugh, stay for the advice.” He’s like, “Let me give you some advice.” I’m like, “Lay it on me, buddy.” He’s like, “Don’t do political comedy. It really divides the crowd.” I was like, “Wow, news flash. I’d never heard something more obvious in my life. Of course, political comedy divides the crowd. That’s what makes it fun. You say something divisive, press people’s buttons, split some hairs, and if you’re good enough, you can bring them back together with a really bad pun. That’s what makes comedy fun. If you think about it, everybody loves political comedy, just not at the same time! That’s how it works. You sit and you wait your turn till the comedian says something you like and stand for. You clap, you cheer, you ',\n",
              "  'go wild, and then for the rest, you politely shut your freedom hole. That’s democracy, baby.” And he’s like, “Well, if this is democracy, then I’m giving you my vote.” I’m like, “No, your vote is to laugh or not laugh. You’re trying to suppress other voters’ rights at this point is what you’re doing.” He’s like, “Buddy, I’m just trying to give you some advice.” I said, “You’re giving me material, buddy, is what you’re doing.” And then, this was the best part, he leans in and he said, “Well, buddy, you should trust me ‘cuz I’m a magician.” I said, “What? Wait, what? What just happened? What did you just say? You just said, ‘Trust me I’m a magician.’ I don’t think anybody’s ever said that before in any language. This guy literally said ‘Trust me, I trick people for money.’ Trust me, I am a magician. I believe the saying is, ‘Don’t trust me, I deceive people on a regular basis.’ That is like, he might as well just pulled a dove out of his hat like, ‘Trust me, I’m a magician.’ Just comes out… ‘You’re a magician, and I’m dividing the crowd? Maybe stop sawing your audience members in half, you divisive mofo.’ Political comedy is fun because you divide the crowd, and then if you’re good enough, you can undivide them.” He’s like, “How do you undivide a crowd?” I’m like, “Trust me, I’m a math comic. Um, you split a crowd apart, and if you’re funny enough, you can bring them back together.” And he’s like, “Do you really believe that?” I was like, ♪ Do you believe in magic? ♪ ♪ Free Palestine ♪ And then the truth came out. He said, “Hey man, what made me upset is that I’m from Israel, and I don’t like you talking bad about my people.” I was like, “I wasn’t doing that. I was just, uh, telling a joke about historical accuracy. That– that was all I was doing.” And he says, “Yeah, but now when people meet me and I tell them I’m for Israel, they think I’m bad.” I’m like, “That’s not my fault. That’s between you and your government, buddy. Like, use your democracy over there.” And like, I get it. You want to critique someone’s comedy, but it’s like, you know, this is the country that I live in. Like, I would never go to Iraq, go to an Iraqi Comedy Club, see an Iraqi comedian on stage be like, “You know America, this freedom you gave us looks a lot like bombs.” And after the show, I’m like, “Hey buddy, can you tone it down with that whole anti-American thing? Trying to get some pussy out here, you kn',\n",
              "  'ow what I’m saying? Trying to get laid in your country, not making me look good.” And I felt for this guy, but I just think, I think he ran out of words because he is a magician, and, uh, and then he just said, “Look man, I heard your Israel-Palestine jokes, and you’re just not building any bridges with those.” And I said, “I’m not trying to build bridges. I’m trying to get laughs, uh, that’s the point of comedy. I’m not like when I go to a show, I don’t hope that people throw little tiny toy bridges at the stage, you know. I’m like hoping for hahas instead, you know, plus I’m Palestinian. We don’t do bridges, we do tunnels, you know what I mean? So, it’s, it’s like a bridge, you just don’t know that it’s happening at the time. I guess what I’m saying is, we’re more connected than you know, you know. See you on the other side.” I already know some people are reacting like, “Oh my God, did he just make a joke about the Palestinian tunnels?” And you’re right. I’m sorry. I meant to use the term gender-neutral maintenance holes. I feel bad for a lot of you guys right now, just like a lot of you’re like, “This is not the kind of comedy that I just wanted. I wanted to go home and stuff. It’s so sturdy, and like, it’s so intense. I didn’t want to cut ha-ha.” This is the point where I want to commend you for still being here, because if you like Samuel Obeid, you come to a show, and you have to be able to listen to the four Ps, okay? Problems, Palestine, puns, and pussy. That’s right, that’s right. If you can tolerate all four, you are a true Samuel Obeid fan. People always critique me like, “Why don’t you just focus on one thing?” No, I want fans who like the whole package, man. That’s why I started with like the pussy stuff, you know? Because people like, you know, “You’re not playing to the crowd. Who’s gonna like the Palestinian material if you open with all that dirty stuff?” I’m like, “But that’s the point. I’m trying to get the people like, ‘Oh yeah, pussy. I’m listening. Palestine. I should. I’m learning,’ you know what I mean? Like, there’s a method to this.” I will say that, um, I did recently find out that my parents, when they first found out about me, were considering an abortion. And… thanks for laughing, but I… I’m not saying this to get any any sympathy or anything. I’m just saying there has been attempts to cancel me, and you wouldn’t be the first. How do we feel about canc',\n",
              "  'el culture in this room, by the way? How do we feel about the cancer culture? Okay, most people don’t like it. Most comedy crowds don’t like cancel culture because they want their comedians still here. Uh, I, on the other hand, I love cancel culture. It clears out more room at the top for me, right? Give me that Louis CK spot, boom. Let’s go. D’Elia’s out. Yeah, buddy. Bad day? Diseased? I’m sorry. Let’s go. It’s like reverse Tetris, just clearing out more space. Yeah, dude. Love cancel culture. I give it a 10 out of 10. But the 10s cancel out, so I give it a one. It’s all funny game so it happens to you. I don’t really cross the line in comedy. My, my goal in comedy is, I like to find the line, walk up to it, wave, and then peace out, um, because like every crowd has its own mind. When you, you’re all individual people, but when you come into a room with other people, you form crowd mind, and you guys all have a collective line. I think your, your guys’ was, uh, I don’t know what was the COVID stuff. So he said, “Cocaine.” Oh, your line is cocaine. Got it. Okay. That’s, that’s a better joke. I found the… Yeah, I could, that part of the room, I fucking know that shit. I found your lines. They’re in your noses. Every crowd has its line. I was doing a show in Berkeley not too long ago, and the line was just me showing up. Doing a show in Berkeley is just like constantly doing limbo. It’s just like, lines, lines, lines, lines, lines. So, I’m doing a joke about the ancient Mayans, okay? Ancient Mayans. A woman gets up in the middle of my joke and she was like, “Racist asshole!” I was like, “Whoa, what’s going on?” She’s like, “You’re talking about my people!” I was like, “The Ancient Mayans?” I was looking for like a time portal in the room, feeling for a draft, you know, like, “Is she an ancient Mayan?” She’s wearing Uggs, you know. She’s got holes in her jeans. Did they do that? How did the Ancient Mayans dress? Then, I was mad at my education. I was like, “Damn you, Berkeley! Why didn’t you tell me they still walk among us?” So, I stopped my joke and apologized. I want you to leave here feeling better than when you came. So, like, if I piss you off, I genuinely will apologize, like I’ll apologize directly to your ego, you know what I mean? Like, I’ll walk up to your ear like, “I’m sorry, baby,” you know, like metaphorically cradling you, giving you whatever you need because I want yo',\n",
              "  'u to have that feeling. I’ll give you this sincere apology, and then I’ll proceed to liking you less than other people, but that’s not your problem. So, I said, “I’m sorry, ma’am. I didn’t mean to offend you. Where’s your family from specifically?” And she was like, “Peru.” I was like, “That’s the Incas, you fucking idiot. Get the fuck out of here! What the fuck are you? You’re just doing ‘paint all indigenous people with a broad brush’? That’s racist!” And that’s how you out-Berkeley Berkeley. I’m the biggest pussy of them all. I am the tiger. What was the Mayan joke? What was the Mayan joke? Thank you. That’s a great question. This was the Mayan joke, um, and it was a… believe me, it was a joke that I wrote like in my first year of comedy. Um, so the joke was, um, the Mayans predicted that civilization was gonna end in 2012, but their civilization ended in 1606. I guess they didn’t know what the fuck they were talking about. It’s like every time I tell a girl I’m gonna last all night. I’m not a prophet, you know? Not a bad joke for a first year of comedy. It’s crazy. I didn’t even… One more thing I want to say is like, before I came on stage, I got locked in the green room. We were trying to, like, for five minutes, I didn’t know if I was gonna make it up here or like if I was gonna have to kick down the door to come up and do my special taping. But that would have been the most boss-like special opening ever. I went to Berkeley. Comedy is a safe space because we are supposedly supposed to be able to say whatever we feel. But if you get offended, there’s nothing wrong with that. There’s this kind of stigma now that if you get offended at a joke that a good comedian tells, there’s something wrong with you, and I just want to make it clear that there’s nothing wrong with you if you get offended at something a comedian says. That just means that you’re human. That’s all that means. I’m concerned if you don’t get offended like, “I went to the comedy show, and I was okay with everything.” Like, get checked out, now. There is something wrong. You need to go to therapy. Everybody has their line, and it’s not a Berkeley line, but it’s a line, you know what I mean? I wanted to know if I was a human. I wanted to know where my line was, so I went to a comedy show. I sat in the back, had some drinks, which is just like a lube. It’s like emotional lube, you know? By the end of the show, I was ',\n",
              "  'like a Drake album, just filled with incoherent feelings. I was angry, but I didn’t know why. I was like a confused social justice warrior. Then the comedian said something that, like, triggered me. He made a joke about virgins, which triggered the 24-year-old in me, and it’s like, “How dare he?” I felt the pussy just bubbling up inside. I was like, “No, no, he didn’t. I’m gonna find him on Instagram and message him.” Picked up my phone, I started to DM him. Took me like 15 minutes to find his handle because I was drunk, and I was about to send him a message on how dumb his joke was, and then I stopped myself immediately. I was like, “What am I doing? I’m a grown-ass comedian.” So, I put down the phone, I took the high road, and instead of DMing, I went home, I listened to Jack Johnson, and I was fine the next day because this is the solution. It gets it out of your system. I call it the self-juicing cleanse, alright? And you have to do it yourself. You have to do the work yourself. You can’t have someone else do it for you. You got to burn those calories to really, really get it out.

              " ['[anthemic classical music playing] [narrator] This story is about Sarah Cooper, who was a morning news anchor from the spring of 2017 to the fall of 2020. At her peak, Cooper had a HUT rating of 54 and a 27 audience share. [imperceptible] [narrator] She looks all right here, but inside, she’s losing her mind every time she utters the words, “Everything’s fine,” which happens to be the name of her morning show. [theme music playing] ♪ Everything’s fine ♪ ♪ It’s a brand-new day ♪ ♪ Everything’s fine ♪ ♪ You’ve got to celebrate ♪ ♪ Everything’s fine ♪ ♪ It’s gonna be okay ♪ ♪ Everything’s fine ♪ Good morning and welcome to Everything’s Fine, the morning show where everything’s fine. I’m your host, Sarah Cooper. Today on the show, an exposé on age-defying makeup. Does it have the power to take off the 14 years you aged in the past six months? We’ll find out. And coming up, there’s a new robot CEO in town, and this time, he’s actually a robot. My exclusive interview with Techtech Corp’s new AI executive, 8008s. Then, an exclusive look inside the now-famous Access Hollywood bus. You don’t want to miss it. A little later, we’ll check in on how the sky is doing with our favorite meteorologist, Andrea Steele. She’s a scientist. Plus, another zoo runs out of money and we’ll sugarcoat what happens to all the animals. Hope you don’t like emus. [chuckles] Then, we’ll have all the latest fall fashions you can wear to that conference call from your bedroom. Big story this morning. Scientists say an asteroid is headed straight for this… Breaking news! Breaking news. The president is on the line and wants to say hi. I guess we weren’t able to change our number. How are you doing, Mr. President? [Trump’s voice] So, we have many exciting things that we’ll be announcing over the next, uh… eight weeks, I would say. Oh. Exciting. We’re gonna get things done. We’re gonna get things done that they’ve wanted to see done… for a long, long time. What have you started on, Mr. President? We’re gonna get things done. We have, uh… We’re taking on immigration, taking on education. We’re taking on so many aspects of things that, uh… people were hopelessly tied up in knots in Congress, but you’ll see, uh… levels of detail, levels of thought… I would love to see detail. …that a lot of people believed very strongly we didn’t have in this country. Uh, Mr. President, it looks like you’re golfing. Things that nobody has even contemplated, thought about, thought possible. We’re gonna get things done. [coughs] So when are you gonna start on this stuff? So, I think we’ll start sometime on Tuesday? [Sarah] Tuesday works. Then we’re going into the immigration, the world of immigration and education. Immigration, educatio',\n",
              "  'n. You did mention that before. We’re going into the world of healthcare. Oh! I’m gonna let you get back… …a lot of exciting… …to starting on those plans, Mr. President. Thank you so much for calling us again. A lot of us are working from home, but some of us are twerking from home. Here to show us how she does it, please welcome Megan Thee Stallion. Hi, Sarah Cooper! Good morning, Megan. Sarah! [static] Can you hear me? Megan? [Megan] Sarah? Megan… Megan, can you hear me? Sarah! Megan? Megan? [chuckles] We’re gonna get a little update from Scooter in a second. We’ll sort this right out. We’ll just move on. Scooter, are you getting the Internet? It seems to be working fine right here. Plenty of Wi-Fi. Plenty. Oh, my goodness, the Internet, right? Wi-Fi is so weird. Yeah. Do we need a modem, Scooter? We need a modem, yeah… [chuckling] [Sarah] It’s a cable joke. [laughing] Hoop-dee-hoo! Yeah. We’ll have to wait between 10:00 a.m. and 6:00 p.m. for them to come in. [laughing] So funny. We might not have any Internet access, but in good news, we have a woman whose baked goods have become a national sensation. Not just for how they taste, but for what they wear. Please welcome, all the way from Wedgecot, New Jersey, the creator of Cupcake Shoes, K.J. Dillard. [Scooter] Think you’re going the wrong way. There we go. [director] All right, go to camera two. Beautiful. [in sing-song voice] My pretty. Little bit of curly hair for you. [gasps] [softly] There we go. Welcome, K.J.! [gasps] Oh, my God, you startled me. [chuckles] I’m here to do the Sarah Cooper show. And we are so excited to have you. These might be the cutest cupcakes I’ve ever seen. They are my pride and joy. Now I’d appreciate it if you got Sarah for me. Thank you. I’m Sarah Cooper. I didn’t say “Sierra,” honey. I said “Sarah.” That is Sarah Cooper. I’m Sarah Cooper, the host of the show. You’re Sarah Cooper? Yep. Can I see some ID? Here is my license, passport, and my birth certificate. No, I need to see some kind of a permit that shows me that you’re allowed to be on the premises. Okay, K.J., why don’t you tell our viewers how you came up with this fabulous idea? Well, I used to design these dolls called “little pooples” that you’d put on the end of your toilet, and then I got tired because I wasn’t able to eat ’em. So, should I be sharing personal information with this person? It just… It helps with banter. I love this little guy. What is his name? His name is Broadway Berry ’cause he’s berry-flavored, and he’s very fragile. Well, I am ready to make one. [gasps and exclaims] [dialing] [operator] 9-1-1, what’s your emergency? This is Karen June Dillard. Karen! I am with a person and my gut tells me she is up to no good.',\n",
              "  ' Scooter. I can’t hear anything. Got my gloves on. [K.J.] Yes, she’s a female. And I would say at least 70% Africo-American. Yes. Now she’s destroying my property! This is my property. [gasps] [woman] Welcome to “Karens.” I’m Whoopi Goldberg. In 1876, a Boston Karen bemoaned to her husband how taxing it was for her to walk miles into town every time she wanted to get a Black person arrested. He vowed to resolve this issue. “Wife,” he said, “I shall make it so that you may summon the police on Black people from the comfort of our very home.” His name was Alexander Graham Bell. [Karen Bell] They’re standing by my horse! [horse neighs] [Whoopi] But the role of Karens did not start with the invention of the telephone. The New World was crawling with Karens. Karen over here, Karen over there, Karens every-goddamn-where. [Karen] They’re on my property! [Whoopi] Some even claim that they can trace the roots of Karens as far back as the book of Genesis. [Karen] They’re eating that snake’s apple! [Whoopi] When we come back, my actual next-door neighbor, Karen. I’ve got a few choice words to say to this bitch. [man] Sore muscles, back pain, headaches and weakness. If you have COVID-19, getting a good night’s sleep can be rough. But starting now, your pesky pains are over. From the makers of MrPillow comes a brand-new product, the MrPillow Coronavirus Vaccine. Hi. I’m Steve Windell, the creator of MrPillow and MrPillowPlus. For 20 years, I’ve dedicated my life to making firm yet fluffy pillows that don’t break the bank. So, I thought, “Why not take the magic of MrPillow and use it to make a vaccine for coronavirus?” So, how does it work? It’s pretty simple, actually. The MrPillow Vaccine is made from thousands of tiny microscopic pillows shrunken down to the size of the deadly virus. Once injected into the bloodstream, these individualized pillows insert themselves under the novel coronavirus and lull it into a restful slumber. The virus now defenseless, the body’s immune cells can go to work. That’s how we here at MrPillow put the science back in sleep science. I got my friendly MrPillow Vaccine in the mail, and three days later, I already feel immune to COVID and ready to mix and mingle. I’m even going to a pool party later. Thank you, MrPillow. And I had COVID for three weeks and then I got it again! Hey! I think I’ll load up on that vaccine right now. Nurse? I feel better already. Order the MrPillow Coronavirus Vaccine for just four easy payments of $99, or $12,000 with insurance. The MrPillow Coronavirus Vaccine works. [man] The MrPillow Coronavirus Vaccine may cause coronavirus. [whirring] [Trump’s voice] Anynomous… really anomous. [speaking alien language] Thank you so much to our ',\n",
              "  'viewers for your patience. We got our technical difficulties all figured out and we are so excited to welcome “she likes to hoist up her moist stuff,” Megan Thee Stallion. Hey, Sarah Cooper! Megan, it is so amazing to have you here. You are such a legend. I have a question. I’m sure it’s on the minds of all our viewers. How are you dealing with this whole “new normal” thing? Listen, Sarah Cooper, I’m not going outside until coronavirus is a memory, okay? Like, you can go back in the textbook and be like, “Damn, y’all remember coronavirus? That shit was crazy, right?” [chuckles] Yeah. So until then, I’m staying my ass in the house. [narrator] Sarah had to make a pee-pee, but knew she had to play it cool for the folks at home. I have to say, that ass you’re staying in the house is very nice. How do you look so good all the time? Well, you know, I like to work out, gotta keep that ass tight, sharp. [chuckling] Real hot-girl shit. [Sarah] Yeah, real hot-girl stuff. Any tips you can give us for working out at home? Definitely. I actually have this great workout called “Drink your drink.” Drink your drink? Goes like this. Get your cup, and one… and two. And… [mimics drink flowing] Is that cognac? Yes, Sarah Cooper, yeah, it is. I been doing this every day for quarantine and let me tell you, I feel great. Well, you look great. Thanks. You, too, can look like this. All you gotta do is grab some cognac, add a little squat to it. Even a little lunge. Real easy, like… Mmm. Like that? A little more sexy and a little less like you sitting on the toilet. Somebody get her some cognac. Scooter, can I get some cognac? [Scooter] Yes. Trying to do the six feet, so… So, all you gotta do is dip and sip. [both] Dip and sip. Dip and sip. Yep, yep, yep. [sexy music playing] I think I’m doing it! I’ve never twerked before in my life. [laughs] It’s happening. No, try it like this. Try it a little more sexy. Okay. Pow, pow, pow. Little hair flip. Girl, live your life, do you, be a hot girl. Everybody wasn’t meant to be in the twerk Olympics, so just do you, be you. Be the best Sarah Cooper you can be. I can do that. This is a really great workout. I know! Real hot-girl shit. [Scooter] If you don’t mind, this is supposed to be six feet. We certainly are lubed up here at the Everything’s Fine studio. We’ll be right back. [Scooter] All right, we are out. Good job. [cork pops] This stuff is really strong. [theme song playing] It’s the 3:00 a.m. hour here on QAnon QAC. Just a note, this is the real QAnon, not the other one people were saying was the real QAnon on 4chan. Please stop doxing me. I’ve had to move five times. Let’s check in with our viewers. Emma from Philadelphia. [Emma] Hey, Ashley. How are you ',\n",
              "  'this morning? Longtime caller, always listening. You blinked your right eye just now when you said this was the real QAnon. Was that a sign that you have been contacted by the god of fire? [chuckles] Don’t be ridiculous, Emma. That was a nervous tic in my eye. It was not a coded message. Believe me, you will know when I’ve been contacted by the god of fire. Thanks, Ashley. [ominous music playing] [easy jazz music playing] This morning, we are proud to feature our Indoctrination Porcelain Doll Collection. They’re stunning dolls, and yes, we do accept cryptocurrency, but only QCoin. Let’s take a look at these dolls. How adorable. It’s presidential mouthpiece, Kellyanne. [Kellyanne’s voice] Don’t be so overly dramatic about it, Chuck. What it… You’re saying it’s a falsehood, and they’re giving Sean Spicer, our press secretary, gave… alternative facts to that, but the point… Ugh. Never a dull moment. This one just talks and talks and talks and talks and talks. Order soon as this one has recently been discontinued. [gasps] Ah! My naan! Thank you, Quincy. I’m so sorry. I am just so starving and it is hard to get good Indian food in this undisclosed location. [sniffs] Ahh! Next caller. [man] Hey, Ashley. [laughing] Mike from Minnesota, how are you again? Did you just get naan from Quincy? Is that a code for QAnon? Right? QAnon, a sign that you’re Q? I am not Q, I am just on in the middle of the night selling porcelain dolls. Q is in Washington uncovering a cabal of sex predators. I appreciate you sending me messages through the TV. Next we have, “I am woman, hear me roar, but very softly so I still sound sexy.” [softly] Ivanka. This doll teaches our daughters that it’s better to be seen and not heard. [Ivanka’s voice] If being complicit is wanting to… Is wanting to be a force for good and to make a positive impact, then I’m complicit. [thunder cracks] [yells in fear] Whoo! The storm is coming. I told you this was the real QAnon. Next caller! [distorted voice] How’s it going? Are you saying we can expect a storm when the president will reveal the mass execution of the Washington figures responsible for murdering a DNC staffer? I’d say keep your eyes open, and coming up in the 4:00 a.m. hour, we have a phenomenal weighted blanket that you’re not gonna– Weighted blankets are a media tool invented by George Soros. Watch your back, Ashley. I always do, honey. I have to. Finally, we have the best first lady, Melania. Beautiful, stunning, and really, what else do you need? [Melania’s voice] I’m very involved in charities now, many charities involving children, involving many different diseases. Hi… Melania. All of these dolls are available now by calling 666-666-6666… 666666… This is not the',\n",
              "  ' real QAnon. Get out now! [Christmas bells jangling] [Sarah] The former QAnon host starts her new job at the White House this week. [breaking news alert plays] We have some breaking news coming in. It appears the president is live-tweeting this program right now, and we’ve noticed a ratings bump when we show what he’s saying about us in real time, so… that’s what we’re gonna do. Okay, so the president is saying that everything is not fine. Uh, I guess we’ll have to see if we can change the name of the show. [Scooter] I’m open to it. “Now they’re playing my tweet. Stop playing my tweet. That’s my tweet.” The president now thinks “the country is totally fine” and “it’s the best it’s ever been.” “Because of me.” Who, me? “No, me, the president.” “Best president ever.” Oh. [cheerfully] Best president ever! And the president now likes our show again and our ratings are… up! Great. More on these tweets as they continue to suck the life out of our democracy. [buzzer sounds] [theme song playing] [Scooter] Great segment. [Sarah] Thank you! [narrator] Sarah wasn’t sure the segment had gone great. She wasn’t sure of much at all anymore. [heart beating] [Scooter] Uh, we’re ready for robot CEO. I’m Sarah Cooper. [echoes] I’m Sarah Cooper. We’ll be right back. [director] We’re out. Do you know what I miss? Shawarma. I miss eating shawarma in a really crowded restaurant in close proximity to other diners. Yeah. People sitting two feet away from you just shoveling food into their disgusting mouths. [man] I miss that human connection. [director] Oh, Sarah. Hi. Why did you want to meet with us? You called me in here. [man] Okay, smarty pants. Let’s look at your file and see how your ratings are doing. I forgot. I can’t read. All right. [clears throat] Looks like 35% of our audience likes that you’re Black, 30% of our audience doesn’t like that you’re Black, 50% of our audience doesn’t know you’re Black, but thankfully, 80% of our audience feels extremely threatened by you, Sarah. It’s that attitude of yours. I don’t think I have an attitude. [man] There it is. There it is. The boss didn’t hire you to be aggressive. The boss hired you to be a non-threatening Black woman like Tootie and Lisa Turtle, and that other one. Lovable, but forgettable. Well, I think it might be a little confusing, because I’m named Sarah, and I feel like when my parents named me Sarah, a white lady just moved into my body and gentrified my whole personality, you know? Like, my mom would cook jerk chicken– I love jerk chicken. He does. He’s a jerk. He loves the chicken. I love it. And I’d be like, “Oh, this is too spicy.” And she’d say, [in Jamaican accent] “There are children around the world, all they get for dinner is b',\n",
              "  \"read and water.” And I’d be like, “That actually sounds pretty good.” Like, a scone and a chai latte. Yes, a scone and chai tea latte would be perfect. Any time of the day. Um… That would be really great ’cause I was born in Jamaica, but moved here when I was three. Jamaica. I knew it. I actually watched these characters when I was little. I mean, Tootie and Lisa and Hilary and… and… Um… And that other one. I mean, these characters inspired me, you know? I feel like they ran so that I could sing. But you can’t sing, which is why you’re on the morning show and not on Broadway. Okay, I will tone it down. [director] Yeah. Stick to the news. All right? Leave politics out of it. Got it. Thank you. [man] Better go. Yeah. Marv, do you think I should buy another gun? Lorraine, what are you talking about? Are you crazy? Of course you should buy another gun. Thank you. We live in very dangerous times. You’re right. [Scooter] Hey, pals. How’s it going? Hi! Scooter. Hey, Scooter. What’s going on here? [Scooter] This is to keep things safe, six-foot distance. Smart. He’s so smart. [Scooter] Well, as you were. See you later. [Lorraine] Thank you. [Marvin chuckles] Get the door on your way out? [Scooter] Sure. I can’t touch the doorknob. Can you just shut the door, please? [Scooter] It’s not me, it’s the door. [Lorraine] Gotta get some work done. If you could– Close the door! [Scooter] This has to get fixed. This is Connie Chung with the president this morning. Mr. President, what is your plan to unite the country? [Trump’s voice] I’m not a big fan of sharks either. I don’t know how many votes I’m gonna lose. I have people calling me up, “Sir, we have a fund to save the shark, it’s called ‘Save the Shark.'” I say, “No, thank you.” Oh, no. Mr. President, I was asking you about uniting the country. I think I am actually humble. I’m much more humble than you would understand. [mutters] Mr. President, I asked you about– Excuse me. Stop and frisk. Okay? Stop and frisk. All right… Excuse me. You take guns away. Rudy Giuliani was a great mayor. He did it in New York. He started it and it worked great. I’m sorry? Excuse me. You have people coming over with bags of soup, big bags of soup, and they lay it on the ground and the anarchists take it and they start throwing it at our cops. Bags of soup, big bags of soup. If it hits you, it’s worse than a brick ’cause it’s got force. So, that was my interview with the president. Hi, I’m Steve Windell, and you’re gonna love my new line of MrPillow feminine hygiene products. Because your vagina deserves a tampon as soft and absorbant as one of my pillows. Try our down-feather version, too! [woman] In these uncertain times, we turn to familiar faces. And since \",\n",
              "  '1975, we’ve been there for you… Twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week. We had to go away for a while, but we knew it wouldn’t be long. Orgies. We’re back! [crowd cheering] Now with curbside pickup. [lullaby playing] [Trump’s voice] Thighland! Thighland! The super-duper missile. Mmm! Did you make this coffee, Scooter? I did not. [buzzer sounds] [theme song playing] [Sarah] Welcome back to Everything’s Fine. Big story this morning. As we’ve previously reported, a huge shake-up in the CEO world happened last Friday when we learned the CEO of Techtech Corp is actually a robot. Strangely, no one even noticed for several months. Live in studio via Camrojex technology, please welcome 8008s. Thanks, Sarah. It’s great to be here. [Sarah] Thank you for taking time out of your busy schedule. Well, I can multitask better than my human counterparts, Sarah. For example, right now, I’m chatting with you, doing Joe Rogan’s podcast, and kicking off a workplace diversity program all at the same time. Okay, so is it safe to assume you’re programmed to simply do everything your predecessors did? Unlike Elon Musk, I have a human side. [Scooter chuckles] Elon Musk. I was made by a great group of guys who really take social change seriously. For example, I’m programmed with the complete knowledge of feminist content such as Sex and the City, Cosmo and “Hot Girl Summer.” I’m not sure I’d consider that feminist– I’ve also learned about the Black experience in America by watching all three Barbershop movies, and the Beauty Shop spin-off. Okay, again, I’m not sure we– I’m sorry. I’m being told that I’m getting off track. As president and CEO, my number-one job is to make my shareholders happy. But that’s kind of been the problem, hasn’t it? Big businesses just focusing on money, making myopic business moves that leave the whole country with more disparity and… How are you doing that? Camrojex technology. Oh, wow. Just relax. This is really inappropriate. But technically, you’re a robot and I haven’t had a massage in months. [sensual song playing] That feels incredible. [sighs] Hold on, we have some breaking news. It’s been reported that Robot CEO 8008s has been fired by its board of directors after making unwanted advances toward an office printer. That printer knew exactly what it was doing. It was always asking me to make a copy. Because that’s its job. And it’s not just a printer, it has a name. HP Printer/Scanner/Copier 500s, whose side of the story I’m sure we all want to hear. Scooter, can we get HP Printer/Scanner/Copier 500s on the cloud system? Thank you so much for joining us, HP Printer/Scanner/Copier 500s. Tell us what happened. [beeping] Okay, wait, wait. I’ll, uh… I’ll make a public st',\n",
              "  'atement. Okay? Just give me two seconds to think. After eight months of careful soul-searching, I’ve decided to address the hideous allegations against me. I have not, nor have I ever mistreated or abused a printer/scanner/copier. I value printers. My printer… is a printer. HP Printer/Scanner/Copier 500s, is there anything you want to say? [whirring and beeping] Sounds like we’re getting a fax. [fax machine printing] “F*ck you, 8008s.” I will now step away to spend time with my family. [theme music playing] Wow. AI has come so far. [Scooter] Three, two, one. We’re out. Can’t believe he’s a robot. Ladies and gentlemen, please give a big Allstate Arena parking lot welcome to Sarah Evak. [car horn honking] Thank you all so much. Hi, my name is Sarah Evak and I’m a close-up card magician. Uh, I’ve been doing this for, I don’t know, ten years. I’ve been everywhere. Singapore, you name it. Tonight’s show is at the Allstate Arena in Rosemont. Pretty exciting for me. [chuckles] I’m going to begin by introducing you to my family. I call them my family because some I see often and others when I least expect them. Can everyone see these? I’m going to shuffle these cards and you tell me when to stop. [horn honking] [Sarah] Okay, I haven’t started shuffling yet. [horn toots] Now I’m shuffling. [horns honking] Got it. Now I’m going to show you all this card. Can everyone see this card? [horns honking] Does anyone work here? [horns honking] Can you take this card and show it? Yeah. Don’t show it to me. Oh, okay. During COVID, I’m also a teacher in a Zoom Room. But this… This is where I come alive. Beep when you’ve seen it. And– [horn beeps] [horn beeps] [man] I’ve never worked with a magician. I was a Frankenstein at a haunted house once, though. So, you know, I’m used to being around performers. Is this your card? I had to get out of that racket ’cause of the Illuminati. You know, they want to get you. [horn beeps] It’s like, not for me. Nope, I’ll stick to parking lot attendant. That’s the life for me. Simple. [car horns blaring] I think it went okay. Yeah. I might have to buy giant cards for shows like these in the future. Um… I don’t know. There’s a lot of beeping. So, when is this gonna be on? I just wanna make sure that I catch it. [man] Uh, sometime next year. Okay. Do you want to see another trick? No? Okay. [woman] We followed the guidelines. We reopened when it was safe. But now, it’s not safe again. [crowd] Aw! [man 1] Honestly? [woman] Orgies. Maybe later. [man 2] Damn it. Wonderful place. Wonderful. Oh, my goodness. Unbelievable. Oh, hello. My name is Natalie, and this is my husband, John. Hi, there. [chuckles] Welcome to Mar-a-Lago. We love it here. It is beautiful. You hear me?',\n",
              "  ' Oh, it’s gorgeous. I know what you’re thinking. “Do they allow Black people at Mar-a-Lago?” Um, we’re here! Right? Laugh it off. We are Black-ish, though. Last time we checked. Last time we checked, we were. Yes. And we’ve actually met the president. He saw us… Yes, we did. …and he said that we are his two favorite Black people. And he says it every single time. Every time. Mmm-hmm. Such a charismatic personality he has. He’s such a celebrity. We actually got married here. Um, not in the big ballroom, but on the property. So it was still beautiful. Yes. Yeah. We’re not allowed in there right now. We’re not allowed in there yet, but there is a small room off to the side with a private entrance, very exclusive. [laughs] And they said we can go in there whenever we want. We can stay in there if we want to. Anytime. And then, one night, we actually got locked in there. And let’s just say it was very fortuitous. Yes, it got kind of hot in there. [ominous music playing] We just love it here. Just surrounded by all our friends. Surrounded by all of our friends, which is the most important part. We got you in our hearts. Right on. [Sarah] If you like skateboarding dogs, you’re gonna wanna stick around after Everything’s Fine for Thinking Outside the Bachs with Jordana Bachman. [Jordana] I don’t know what this is about to be, but okay! [Sarah] Coming up at the twelve o’clock hour. Let’s do the weather segment. Love the weather. Love the weather! [Lorraine] Mmm. [theme song playing] Okay, weather segment in three, two… And now, let’s check in on how the sky’s doing today with our meteorologist, Andrea Steele. Thanks, Sarah. Well, we’re looking at some real clear skies today, up to 75 degrees. Absolutely beautiful out. Let’s look ahead at the five-day forecast. Tuesday, we’re gonna see a bit of rain, but break out that summer gear as temperatures shoot up to a whopping 103 degrees. Wednesday, out of nowhere, there’s gonna be a ferocious hailstorm with sustained winds up to 75-plus miles per hour. Scooter, you may wanna board up your windows. My windows are always boarded up. You know that weird house in your neighborhood that’s got all the boards up in the windows, and everyone thinks, “Is that an abandoned hospital?” That’s my place. Excellent. Thursday, you might wanna break out the sunscreen again, because it’s gonna be a hot one. 123 degrees with a humidity index so high, a friend of mine who works at the EPA called me crying. He’s a grown man. Friday, we shoot down to negative 12 degrees with a windchill index we weren’t even able to calculate using a Doppler 8000 technology. It’s gonna be a cold one, folks. Most likely not survivable, so wear a jacket. And Saturday, temperatures ra',\n",

We’re actually projecting literal flaming snowmen to be walking the streets with some possible fire tornado watches in effect. Everything’s fine with the weather. I’m Andrea Steele. Back to you, Sarah. Andrea, I’m sorry, but that forecast is– Insane? Uh, yeah. You think? I mean, I’ve been doing the weather for 17 years, Sarah, and I have never seen anything like this in my entire lifetime. You think I like telling people they’re gonna die, or their skin might peel off if they run to the grocery store? No one should be going outside unless they absolutely have to. [heart beating] Scooter? [narrator] Everything was not fine. [exhales deeply] Scooter, are you asleep? [narrator] Had the world gone mad? Andrea, are you okay? [scoffs] Am I okay? This b!tch. Am I okay? Um… No, actually, ’cause we got a bat disease just floating around in the sky, there’s a new natural disaster every motherf*cking day, factories destroying the environment. Look at this damn forecast behind me. This is the first time I’ve left my house in months! All it takes is one wrong motherf*cker to breathe on me funny, and I swear to God… Scooter, are we still on a nine-second delay? The woman who presses that button stopped coming in weeks ago. Well, in that case, let me just say this. F*ck, sh!tty, doo-doo, b!tch, and stay the f*ck in your house. Reporting live from hell on earth, this is Andrea motherf*cking Steele. Back to you, Sarah. That was great. We’ll be right back. [buzzer sounds] Great. We’re out. Nice. Wow. So that’s your house I walk by every day. [Scooter] Yeah. Ah. My kids are terrified to go past there. [chuckling] That’s the one. It doesn’t look like anyone’s lived there in hundreds of years. [Scooter] That’s my place. [Andrea] Interesting. Well, it’s safe. It’s spooky. [Scooter] Yeah. It’s awful there. Everybody ready? Here we go. Five, four, three, two, one. Welcome back to Everything’s Fine. I’m Sarah Cooper. And now for our top story, an exclusive look inside that now-famous Access Hollywood bus. [man’s voice] She used to be great. Still beautiful. [Trump’s voice] I moved on her. She was down in Palm Beach. I moved on her and I failed, I’ll admit it. Whoa. I did try and fuck her. She was married. That’s huge news there. [Trump’s voice] No, Nancy… This was… And I moved on her very heavily. In fact, I took her out furniture shopping. She wanted to get some furniture. I said, “I’ll show you where they have some nice furniture.” Took her out furniture– I moved on her like a b!tch. But I couldn’t get there, and she was married. All of a sudden I see her, she’s now got the big phony tits and everything. She’s ch',\n",
              "  'anged her look. Sheesh, your girl’s hot as shit. In the purple. [all] Whoa! [Billy Bush’s voice] Yes! Yes! The Donald has scored! [all laughing] Oh, my man! Wait, you gotta look at me when you… [indistinct chatter] Thumbs up. [Trump’s voice] You’re a pussy. You gotta put the thumbs up. Gotta get the thumbs up. You can’t be too happy. [man 1] Let me… [man 2] That’s funny. You and I will walk out. Oh, my God. [indistinct chatter] Maybe it’s a different one. Better not be the publicist. No, it’s her. [Trump’s voice] Yeah, that’s her. With the gold. I gotta use some Tic Tacs, just in case I start kissing her. I’m automatically attracted to beautiful… I just start kissing them. It’s like a magnet, I just kiss. [laughing] I don’t even wait. And when you’re a star, they let you do it. Just kiss. Just… You can do anything. Whatever you want. Grab ’em by the p*ssy. I can do anything. I can do anything. Those legs, all I can see is the legs. Oh, it looks good. Come on, shorty. Ooh, nice legs, huh? Oof. Get out of the way, honey. That’s good legs. Go ahead. It’s always good if you don’t fall out of the bus. Like Ford, Gerald Ford, remember? [Bush’s voice] Down below. Pull the handle. Hello. How are you? Hi. [Zucker’s voice] How are you? [Trump’s voice] Terrific. Pleasure to meet you. You know Billy Bush? Hello, nice to see you. How you doing, Arianne? I’m doing well, thank you. Ready to be a soap star? We’re ready. Make me a soap star. How about a hug for the Donald? He just got off the bus. Want a little hug? [Trump’s voice] Absolutely. Melania said this was okay. Hug for the Bushy? I just got off the bus. Oh! Bushy. [Bush’s voice] Here we go. Excellent. Excellent. Excellent. You’ve got a nice costar here. Yes. Absolutely. [Trump’s voice] After you. [heart beating] Great. We’re out. Nice. Scooter, what is happening? [both laughing] [Lorraine] This job is made for you, Marvin. Yeah, it keeps me out of trouble, as they say. Everything’s fine. Three, two, one, and we’re in. Sarah. And now, a little preview of what’s coming on after Everything’s Fine. We’ll have Jordana Bachman of Thinking Outside the Bachs, followed by Sandy Manderson, Miyoko Loco, and then, Andre Cole Watkins of Watkins the News. Stick around, it’s gonna be a great day. Isn’t it, Scooter? Miyoko Loco. [chuckles] A little help here. Save me. How about Sandy Manderson? Her face froze? Help. Tomorrow, something bad happens to your favorite celebrity. We’ll have a full report. Now, it’s over to Jordana Bachman for Thinking Outside the Bachs. Jordana, how are you doing? I’m doing good, girl. How are you, sister-friend? I’m doing so good. What do you got going on on the show today? Oh, well, let me tell you. A little bit of this',\n",
              "  ', a little bit of that. Who knows? It’s the news. Who cares? You know, Jordana, I just realized we don’t have to do this anymore. You have to tell me. Do what? Do what? [laughing] This whole BFF handoff like we’re friends, laughing like we care about each other. We don’t care about each other. [Jordana] That, girl, is good news, because everyone can see through the bullsh!t! I don’t even know where you live. I don’t even see you except in this TV screen. That’s how I feel, just seeing you through a little box. What have you been up to? Girl, I’ve been up to so much. I’ve locked up every Black man in my life. I put my dad in a closet, my brother in a closet, my uncle in a closet, to make sure they live another day. Wow. Where do you put your clothes? [laughing] Oh, my God. What are we doing? Scooter. I’m sorry? And now, it is over to you, Jordana Bachman. Oh, no, girl, I couldn’t. I couldn’t. I have to pass it back to you, Sarah Cooper. You’re so funny. Back to you. You’re up next with Thinking Outside the Bachs. No, Sarah, you got this one. Take my three-hour show. No, I couldn’t. I couldn’t do that. Back to you, Jordana. Back to you. Scooter? Oof. [Sarah] Where’d she go? Can we get Jordana back, please? [upbeat song playing] Jordana! Back to you! Back to you, Jordana. All right. Five, four, three, two… Good morning. I’m Sarah Cooper, filling in for another three hours. Jordana Bachman of Thinking Outside the Bachs is taking a personal day. Good morning. I’m Sarah Cooper. That’s a lot of news. And it’s Sarah filling in for Andre Cole Watkins. Five, four, three, two… Good morning. I’m Sarah Cooper, covering for Andre Cole Watkins, host of Watkins The News. Is that a lot of news or what?

Great… Hi! [shrieks] Oh, my God! Who are you? What are you doing down here? I’m Lacy Groin, from Against the Groin? My show. It’s on every night at 9:00. Oh, my God. Lacy Groin! Yeah. I love your show. Aw. Oh, thank you. It’s been off the air for, like, four years. Four years? [heart beating] The last thing I remember was election night, and I started hyperventilating. I choked on my Invisalign, and then I guess I passed out under here. It’s kinda weird nobody noticed. Yeah. I found this work environment to be pretty toxic. What did I miss? I want to know everything. Would you mind massaging my legs? I think they’re in atrophy. Cute shoes. Thanks. That’s a cute blazer. Thank you. So, tell me everything. What did I miss? You want to know everything? Oh, yeah. Everything. Here’s everything. [gasps] [gasps] Oh. No. No, stop! No! Oh, God! What? That’s against the law. No, no! Yes, there’s more! No, I can’t. Oh, God! Look at me! [whimpering] There’s more! No! There’s more! No! I… I can’t. Here. Oh. Oh, MrPillow. Hi. Thank you. Gracias. Mmm. See you later, Lacy. [jazz music playing] Scooter? Hello? [Marvin] Oh! [Lorraine] Marvin, you’re crazy. [Marvin] Yes, I am. [both laugh] [Lorraine] But what if we slot the Iranian assassination in 2024? [Marvin] No, no, no. I would do it sooner because we want relations with Iran to go as poorly as possible. Put it in 2021. [Lorraine] Okay. Yes. What if we shave two tons off the Greenland ice sheet? Yeah, yeah, yeah. 2028 or 2022? 2027. And let’s do something with bugs. I don’t know. Hornets! Who love to murder. [upbeat music playing] [both] Murder hornets! Oh! Yeah, yeah, yeah. And China seizes Hong Kong, 2028. And that pairs very nicely with the US gassing its own citizens. [giggles] Floods, 2026. What if Tom Hanks gets sick? Do it! He’s due! Kill off Mr. Peanut? Cancel Coachella. I hate those bands. Eating bats? I… No, that’s too much. Let’s set Australia on fire! Turn the sky red! [distorted voice] Do it all in 2020. Really, boss? That’s a lot for one year, Dark Lord. I said, do it all in 2020! [cackling] Okay, boss! [all laughing] [Satan speaks backwards] Uh, Satan. Sarah, I understand. You’re mad as hell, and you’re not gonna take this anymore. Hmm? [Sarah] Um… [squelching] [speaking backwards] Scooter? Hey, boss. Hey, Scooter. I… I get it now. I didn’t see that before. How’d you get in here? You should really get back to the desk. Back to the desk, Sarah Cooper. [both speaking backwards] I think I should go home. [speaking backwards] [Whoopi’s voice] What you gonna do, ',\n",
              "  'Satan? You know, we’ve tangled before. And you know what happened. It’s Whoopi Goldberg talking to you now. What you gonna do? [in normal voice] Oh, my God. I don’t know where that came from. [narrator] At this moment, Sarah Cooper realized it wasn’t she who had lost her mind, it was the world. Scooter, help me out. Um… You should just take the afternoon off. I just went scuba diving. I love scuba diving. You scuba dive? Love it. Maybe we should give her a raise. A raise would be great. [both laughing] I’m not gonna get a raise. I am a woman, so that does make more sense. Take all the time you need, Sarah. [in distorted voice] Never running out of news down here. Great. Okay.

Thank you, everybody! [cheering swells] Thank you. Please, take a seat. [audience quiets] Thank you so much. Thanks for coming out. Yeah, man. We’re here. [scattered cheers] Yeah. [cheering grows louder] [cheering fades] Well, let me ask you guys something, man. Are they gonna keep taking our Confederate statues down or what? [laughter] [man] Yeah! [laughter] Just taking the temperature of the room. I don’t know who’s here, you know? [laughter] [groans disgustedly] “That’s a weird one to start.” All right. [laughter] Yeah, I’ve been on this, uh, phenomenal tour, and I’ve, uh, I’ve met people I never thought I would meet in my life. Recently I met a supermodel, which is wild because… Well, I don’t think she wanted to meet me. I should be clear. I was in a… a fancy hotel in Toronto, and somebody that worked there, they go to her, “Hey, he’s a comedian.” And she was like, “Okay.” [laughter] And then they go, “She’s a supermodel.” I was like, “I can see.” [laughter] And what struck me is that they are so much better-looking than you think they’re gonna be. Like, you see in a magazine or on your phone, and you’re like, “She’s pretty.” But in person, you’re like, “What the fuck is happening right now?” [laughter] And then you realize that it’s a genetic freak. [crowd chuckles] It is. If you are a supermodel, you are a freak. You are no different than a seven-foot-tall man. [laughter] I don’t know if you’ve ever met a seven-footer. I have. It is unsettling. All right? You basically… you go, like, “Am I a child? What… What is happening?” This woman was so unbelievably good-looking. Like, five seconds into our conversation, I stopped speaking and listening. All right? [laughter] I was looking at her like she was at the zoo. I was like… [laughter] I was like, “Let me see your ears.” Was looking for flaws. [laughter] She was absolutely perfect. And then my next thought was, “Why can’t my wife just drown?” You know? [laughter] [scattered applause] She knows. I told her. She knows. [laughter] She’s like, “You know I can swim, right?” “I know. Doesn’t matter if you can swim. It matters if a jury believes you can.” So… [laughter] [snorts] I’ve, uh… I’ve been to unbelievable places because of this job. It’s… It’s really crazy. I’ve… I’ve seen amazing places. Been to Rome. Hong Kong. Machu Picchu. All because of this job. And then, there’s other days. [crowd chuckling] Like, I had to go to Topeka, Kansas to do a show. [laughter] We went because they bought tickets, but we got the fuck out right away. [laughter] There was something cool that happened there, which is that my show there was protested by the Westboro Baptist Church. Uh… [mumbles] [cheers and applause] Don’t know if you know them. Sometimes ',\n",
              "  'they’re in the news. [crowd chuckles] If you’re like, “Oh, really? There’s a church in the news? But why?” [laughter] Well, sometimes they also protest dead soldiers’ funerals, cool shit like that. And… I was backstage, and my tour manager came in the room, he goes, “Westboro Baptist Church is here.” I was like, “To see the show? Really?” [laughter] And he was like, “No.” Said, “They’re protesting.” And they were out front with their dumb fuckin’ signs. [crowd chuckling] Their homemade signs ’cause they’re poor. Uh… [laughter] They had signs made that said, “Tom is a sinner.” And I was like, “Yes.” [crowd cheering] [mumbles] Yeah. True. [cheers fade] [scattered applause] Then they had, like, real hateful signs too that said, uh, like, “God hates gays.” But didn’t say “gay.” [laughter] It was another word. [laughter continues] [laughter swells] Your dad says it when the Cardinals lose. You know, like, uh… [laughter, cheering] [scattered applause] All right, your uncle. Somebody says it. Uh… [laughter] I took offense. Not so much to the word as the implication. That God hates gays. I don’t think that’s true. I think God has a people problem. There are too many people, and that is not gay people’s fault. [laughter] [cheers, applause] Because they butt fuck. I have to spell everything out? [laughter] Jesus. You can nut as hard as you want in somebody’s ass over and over and over, and something will come out, but it’s not a baby. Uh… [audience member whistles] [cheering] I mean… [cheering continues] Still worth taking a picture of, I would argue. [laughter] Maybe give it a name. It’s not gonna live long. Uh… [hushed laughter] [laughter swells] I’m not gay, but… I am not above checking out a dude. I’m serious. Like, if I’m at the beach and there’s some super fucking, like… just yoked dude there, I’ll be like, “Hey.” “Nice.” [laughter] “Very nice.” “What’s your protein intake? What do you do?” “Cardio and lift? Of course.” Then a hot chick’ll walk by. “Get outta here. What are you doing?” [laughter] I think the gayest I ever was… [laughter] …was in February. [laughter] That’s when I did my shows in Los Angeles and Brad Pitt came to my show. [cheers and applause] Look… I do not know what year he was born or how many infants he consumes in a week, but that man… [laughter] …is stunning. All right? He came into my dressing room. I couldn’t make eye contact. Do you understand? I was like, “Hey, what’s up, man? How you doing?” [laughter] He goes, “Look at me.” I was like, “No.” [laughter continues] He goes, “Come on.” I said, “Shut up.” [laughter] [laughter continues] He goes, “Wanna give me a kiss?” I was like, “Yeah.” [laughter] [scattered applause] He goes, “Do it.” I went… Like that, I kissed him. [laughter] What? [crowd cheering] [audience member whistles] It wasn’t gay. [laughter] We took a bath later. That was gay. But… [laughter] …we talked about sports, so it balanced out, you know? I think you’re lucky if, in this life, you have, like, one real friend. You k',\n",
              "  'now? Like a true friend. I think I have four. Brad Pitt… [laughter] Um… I call him Pitt Stop ’cause we’re close. Uh… [laughter] And three other guys. People you know intimately. Like, you know each other’s secrets and stuff. Like, one of my friends, I know that he hides that he smokes weed from his wife. His name is Casey. Um… [laughter] One of my friends hides that he eats McDonald’s from his wife because he’s fat, and his name is Charlie. [laughter] [laughs devilishly] I guess they know now, but, you know… It’s wild when you find out something new after knowing people that long. I’ve known these guys, like, 25, 30 years. And I found out last week, so 25 years into these friendships, that I’m the only one who eats ass. In that entire group. Isn’t that… crazy to you? Like… [cheers and applause] I guess I’m friends with a bunch of third-graders. I don’t know. Like… [laughter] One of the guys is newly in love too. Justin. Newly in love. Usually newly in love people are really on board, you know? Because everything’s rainbows and butterflies. Like, every day Justin’s like… [giggles gleefully] [laughter] [softly] “I’m in love.” I go, “That’s great. Did you eat her ass?” He’s like, “No.” I said, “So you don’t like her.” [laughter] And he was like, “No, I do.” And I said, “No, you don’t.” [laughter] “If you did, you’d give her the sweetest kiss of all.” [laughter] [scattered applause] And he goes, “That’s where she shits.” [laughter] I was like, “Yeah, don’t do it then.” [laughter] Wait a while, you know? Put her in a bath or something. That’s what I did with Brad. Now… [laughter] [cheers and applause] [applause fades] He goes, “You’re gross.” I was like, “Whatever.” And he said, “That’s what a dog does.” I said, “Excuse me?” [laughter] He goes, “A dog licks its own ass.” I said, “First of all, if I could lick my own ass, I wouldn’t be on tour, all right?” [laughter] I would do it until a doctor told me to stop. [laughter] He would have to sit me down and be like, “You’re not gonna have an ass soon if you don’t knock this off.” [laughter] I’d be like, “But it feels good.” [laughter] And he’d go, “I don’t trust you.” “Gonna put a cone around your neck.” I’d be like… “I can take it off with my paws.” Okay… [laughter fades, swells] Sorry, that was very stupid. I’m sorry. Now… I wish my dad was still here, you know? He died a few months ago. And I understand it’s part of life. It happens to everybody. And, uh, you know, I… I just… I had never visited somebody sick in the hospital. That was a new experience. It’s strange. If you’ve never done it, you get to the hospital and then somebody that works there goes, “Are you here to see…” And you go, “Yeah.” They go, “They’re gonna die soon.” And you’re like, “I thought so too. That’s why I came.” [laughter] And then they go, “You can go in there and watch that now.” And you’re like, “Thanks.” [scattered laughter] Personally, I feel like watching somebody die that you’re not trying to kill… is weird, you know? [laughter] ',\n",
              "  'Like, it’s different if you have somebody and you’re like… [laughter] And they go, “I’m dying.” Like, “I know. I want you dead. That’s why I’m doing this.” Probably feels good. I don’t know. I’m assuming it’s a euphoric feeling that you chase forever and ever. But… Ask Garth Brooks. He’ll tell you all about it. So… [loud cheering, applause] Come on. Where are the bodies, G? [cheering continues] Please. [cheering continues, fades] Connect the dots. Now… [laughter] I will tell you this. I did have a great conversation with my father. And I hope if you’re ever in that situation, you get it too. We had this great talk. And then he just drops this on me. He goes, “You know what I’ve never told you?” And I was like, “No. What?” And I was really hoping he was gonna say, you know, “There’s a treasure buried in the backyard.” [laughter] “It’s for you.” I go, “What have you never told me?” He goes, “I like a full bush on a lady.” And I was like, “What? What?” [laughter] [scattered applause] He goes, “Your mother keeps trimming hers.” I go, “Hey, what the fuck, man?” [laughter] I go, “Why are you telling me this?” And he goes, “Who am I supposed to tell?” [laughter] I go, “The Lord. You’re about to meet him.” And that was it. Then he said the “N” word and then he died. [mumbles] [laughter] [scattered cheers and applause] It was his last wish. All right? Yeah. Make-A-Wish was pissed. [laughter] They were like, “We don’t do that.” I was like, “Well, maybe you should.” If it was between saying that or meeting Tom Brady, I’d be like, “Fuck Tom Brady. I wanna say it.” [laughter] [scattered cheers and applause] [loud cheering] What really sucks about losing a parent is when you have kids. ‘Cause you want your parents to hang out with your kids, you know? Like, I have… I have two boys. They’re six and three. And they are boys. Like, real “he/him” s, if you know what I’m saying. Uh… [laughter] Don’t worry, we asked them. All right? [mumbles] They were like… [gruff] “Definitely.” We’re like, “Oh, okay.” “It’s up to you.” Now… [hushed laughter] [laughter slowly builds] [scattered applause] [loud cheering and applause] Luckily, I have a cousin that lives near me and he has two girls the same age. Six and three. So I get this wildly different experience up close and in person all the time. And these girls come over to my house. My God. What did I do wrong where I didn’t get girls? These girls… they show up, and they’re like, [softly] “Hello, Uncle Tommy.” [laughter] I go, “Hello to you.” [laughter] They go, “Where should we sit?” I go, “Try one of the chairs.” [laughter] And they go, “We would like to color.” I go, “Please.” [laughter] And then they sit down and they fucking color. [laughter] [scattered applause] An hour later, I can go into that room and they’re like… [humming pleasantly] [laughter] I go, “That’s nice.” “Where are my boys?” [laughter] “Are they in the house?” “Are they on the house?” [laughter] “Are they… Oh, they’re on the street. Fantastic.” I go out, like, ',\n",
              "  '“What the hell are you guys doing?” And they’re like, “We broke all the crayons…” [laughter] “…and we put ’em in the mailbox.” And I go… [laughter] [scattered applause] “Thank you. Thanks for doing that.” [cheers and applause] [audience member whistles] My six-year-old, he goes, “What would you do if a bad guy took your stuff?” [crowd chuckles] “Would ask him to give it back. I don’t know.” He goes, “I would get a sword.” [laughter] “I would cut him into pieces.” [laughter continues] “And I’d put the pieces in the mailbox.” I’m like… [laughter] “What are you doing with the mailbox, Dahmer?” [laughter] He goes, “You know Grandpa liked a full bush?” I go, “Hey…” [uproarious laughter] “Did he call you? How do you know?” [audience member whistles] [cheering] [man shouts indistinctly] My kids call me Tom. [laughter] So unnerving. Every day, the older one’s like… [gravelly] “How you doing, Tom?” I go, “Hey, I’m not your fuckin’ stepdad, all right?” [laughter] [scattered cheering] “I wish I was. It’d be a lot easier. But I’m not.” [cheering] [scattered applause] I go, “Call me Dad.” He goes, “I like Tom.” I’m like, “All right.” “What is up with your voice? You smoke cigarettes? Why do you talk like that?” The kid sounds like he fixes Harleys all day, but… [laughter] …he’s really just obsessed with the decades-old video game, Pac-Man. And he has Pac-Man questions morning, noon, and night. He woke me up at three in the morning. Let’s be clear. He doesn’t know how to wake somebody up. All right? He stood an inch from my face… [laughter] The most menacing way somebody can wake you up. He just goes, “Hey, Tom!” I was like, “Holy shit!” [laughter] “What?!” [laughter continues] He’s like, “What would happen… if Pac-Man needed a house?” I’m like, “What the… What?!” [laughter] He thinks I didn’t understand the question. [laughter] So he slows it down. For me. [laughter] He goes… [enunciated dramatically] “What would hap-pen… if…” I go, “He’d call a realtor.” I’m having a heart attack, all right? [laughter] “Pac-Man would get a loan and buy a house.” He’s like, “Okay, I’m going to bed.” I’m like, “All right. I’ll be up for three days. Thanks.” [laughter] [man whoops] At the same time, I have a monitor on the nightstand for the little guy. This dude stands up in bed and he goes, “What was that?” [laughter] So now I drag my ass into his room. He’s standing there with his gut out. You know they’re like… [laughter] [scattered applause] I’m like, “Do you own a Chevron? Why do you stand like that, dude?” [laughter] I go, “What?” He goes, “What was that?” I go, “What was what?” He goes, “That.” I go, “What’s that?” He goes, “What was that?” “I don’t know what you’re asking.” [laughter] He goes, “Was that the choo-choo?” I said, “What?” He goes… [exasperatedly] “Was it a choo-choo?” [crowd chuckling] He said it like, “Are you stupid enough…” [laughter] “…to turn our trains on without the conductor at the helm?” I go, “No.” He goes, “So, what was it?” I go, “I don’t know.” I said,',\n",
              "  ' “Maybe it was a choo-choo.” He goes, “Yeah. Don’t do that.” I was like, “Oh.” [laughter] “All right, al-Qaeda boss, go back in your cave.” [laughter fades to soft murmuring] He’s one of those kids that only laughs at real anger. I don’t know if you’ve ever met one of those peaches, but… See, most two and three-year-olds, they laugh at manufactured anger. Performative anger. You can go up to a kid that age and just go, “Rarrr. And they’re like…” [giggles joyfully] And this kid’s like, “Mm-mmm.” “I wanna see your blood pressure spike, man.” [laughter] The hardest I’ve ever seen him laugh, it’s not even close, is when he flushed my car keys down the toilet. [audience exclaims] It was my fault, I guess. I didn’t hang them up. I put them on the coffee table that I also bought. And… [laughter] I was laying on the couch. You know, it was a long day. I see his little ass come in the room, see the keys, and he’s like… [laughter] And I go, “No. Don’t.” And he picks them up and he goes, “Chase me.” [laughter] “Down the hall.” [laughter] I go, “Okay.” I give him a head start. He’s three. [laughter continues] When I stand up, I see him dip into the bathroom. I’m like… “No.” [laughter] And when I get there… [imitates toilet flushing] And I lose my shit. [laughter] I don’t yell at him. I’m just yelling at my life. You know? [laughter] I’m like, “Fuck!” [laughter continues] “No!” “Fuck!” And when I turn, he’s like, “That’s what I’m talking about.” [loud cheering, applause] [audience member whistles] “You’re a very funny guy.” [laughter] Fuckin’ kicked him in the chest. [laughter] [chuckles softly] God, those little shits. I took a shower with the, uh, six-year-old. He’s six, he’s not 16. Um… [laughter] If you’ve never showered with a six-year-old, let me give you some advice: make sure it’s yours. Otherwise… [laughter] It’s strange if you’re like, “What’s your name?” [laughter] He’s my son. And I wanted to, you know… I was trying to be like a fun dad. I… I offered him the showerhead. I thought it was a fun, in-the-moment thing. I go, “Do you wanna hold the showerhead?” And he was like, “Yeah.” [laughter] I give it to him. He just starts cleaning the shower. He’s like… [laughter] So, you know, after a minute, I’m like, “Can you wet me?” [laughter] And he goes, “Tom, relax. All right?” [laughter] [scattered applause, cheering] Then he looks up at me. He goes… [gravelly] “You have a big penis.” [laughter] “And I have a small one.” [laughter] I go, “Well, that’s ’cause mine’s hard, buddy.” [uproarious laughter] [cheers and applause] “We can make yours hard too. Just gotta go like…” [audience exclaims, laughs] [hushed murmurs, chatter] [disappointedly] “No.” [laughter] [laughingly] I did not jerk off my son. [laughter] I just always wanted to say that. Uh… [laughter] [sputters, laughs] [laughter] The truth is… The truth is, he really did say, “You have a big penis. And I have a small one.” And what I really said, immediately, and I mean in a split second of him saying that, ',\n",
              "  'I went… [gutturally] “No!” [laughter] And if you’re like, “Why did you shout, ‘No’?” I think because in that split second I thought, “I don’t want this to be some shit you start saying when we’re out.” [laughter] I don’t wanna be in a store where he’s like, “Do you have a big penis?” I’ll be like… “Yeah.” [laughter] “You know how it is.” Guy’s like, “I don’t know how it is.” “What the fuck was that all about?” [crowd chuckling] The worst part is that I scared him. When I shouted. That’s a terrible feeling. You see fear register on your kid’s face because of your overreaction. And I wanted to say the right thing. Or whatever the right thing is to say in that situation. Which I suppose would’ve been something like, “You didn’t do anything wrong. You made an observation.” “I shouldn’t have shouted. I’m sorry. Do you need therapy?” “I love you, man.” You know… [laughter] But it was all happening so quickly that I didn’t know what to say. So the fuckin’ best I could come up with? I went, “No!” “Just… shh.” [laughter] Now he’s totally confused. [crowd chuckling] He goes… [whispers] “You have a big penis.” [laughter] “I have a small one.” [laughter continues] I go, “Well, don’t fuckin’ tell anybody.” He goes, “Did Grandpa have a big penis?” I go, “I don’t remember. Haven’t seen it in a long time.” [laughter] “Let’s go ask Grandma.” [laughter continues] And we did. [scattered cheers] And he didn’t. [laughter] [scattered applause] [loud cheering] [audience member whistles] For the record, neither do I. [laughter] I wanna make that perfectly clear to everybody here. I do not have a big penis. But… next to a six-year-old… [laughter] …I got a fuckin’ sledgehammer on me. Pretty proud of it. [cheering] [whistling] [snorts, splutters] [two thudding slaps] [chokes] You almost broke the fuckin’ stage, dude. [laughter] [sighs] The truth is this. I’m just, uh… I’m happy to be doing stand-up again and actually standing. Because not long ago, I had a sports-related injury. I don’t know if you know this or not. Um… [crowd cheering] Well… If you don’t know, I will try to say this with a straight face. Uh… I, Tom, the guy you see standing up here, I was severely injured whilst participating in a slam-dunk contest. [scattered cheers and applause] [loud cheering] Um… On a slightly-lowered rim. Now… It was wild. If you don’t know, I tore my patellar tendon… [exhales swiftly] …right there. Which, you know, whatever. [chuckles] [laughter] Happened to Klay Thompson, happened to me. It happens to us. But… [laughter] I’m not Klay Thompson, so I also broke this arm. And… It’s all captured on video that I find very not funny, but a lot of people enjoy it. [scattered applause] I have to tell people, “I didn’t laugh a lot that night.” And they’re like, “Really?” Yeah. There is one exchange that I do like to share, and it is this. Immediately after I was hurt, I was in the emergency room. And I was badly hurt. I had a shattered arm, a leg that didn’t function. And they were prepping me for t',\n",
              "  'he operating room. And at that time, a trauma surgeon came into that room and he looked at my x-rays and he goes, “Car accident?” [laughter] And I got to lay there and go… [quietly] “Dunk contest.” [laughter] [cheers and applause] And he goes, “What was that? What did you just say?” And I go, “Slam motherfuckin’ dunk contest.” [laughter] He goes, “Did a car hit you while you were dunking?” [laughter] I said, “Why don’t you do your fuckin’ job, all right?” Some people don’t know this, I was in the hospital for three weeks. That’s a long time. I don’t think I would’ve made it through if it weren’t for my dear, dear friend, Dilaudid. Um… [laughter] [scattered cheers] Yeah. I did not realize that I have been fucking around with weed all these years… [scattered cheering] …when narcotics is where it’s at. All right? [cheering] [scattered applause] That shit is electric. And… if anybody ever offers you an oxy, say, “Hit me two times.” Because… they’re amazing and nothing bad’ll happen to you. [laughter] Nah, your life will fall apart, but it’ll feel good while it’s happening. The only downside really is that you’ll never shit… again. Uh… [laughter] I took my first shit eight days after I started eating those. I was scared. I called in the doctor. I was like, “I have an arm that doesn’t work, a leg that doesn’t work.” “How do I lean? How do I wipe myself?” He goes, “Don’t worry about it.” “One of the nurses will do it.” And I was like, “Okay.” [laughter] And then a fuckin’ male nurse came in the room. [laughter] They’re allowed to have the job too. And… [crowd chuckling] This dude stood at the door and threw a pack of wipes. [laughter] I go, “What’s that?” He said, “The doctor said you need to clean yourself.” And I went… [chuckles devilishly] [uproarious laughter] “You’re gonna do it.” And I saw a grown professional nurse just go, “Ah, fuck.” Like… [laughter] He quit. I saw him quit his job. Isn’t that crazy? Now… Five days later, I had my second movement, and they sent in an old-lady nurse, which is fine. But she talked the whole time. Do you know how terrible…? You’re vulnerable. Like… [whimpers] She’s back there, like, “How we gonna clean up all this stool?” I’m like, “I don’t know. Shut up.” [laughter] And she goes, “My, my, my.” “You have so much hair back here.” And I’m like… “Yeah, I do it for my dad.” You know, like… [laughter] [cheers and applause] What? I mean… I like to picture him up in heaven, looking down. “Look at that hair on my son. Isn’t that nice?” God’s with him. “That is nice.” [laughter] I picture my dad naked. You know? [laughs] I… [laughter] I picture everybody in heaven nak… I don’t think you’re in heaven, “What shirt should I wear today?” I think people are naked. I think God’s naked. I think after a while it makes sense that my father would notice that God has a fuckin’ piece on him. You know? It’s God. I think it’s enormous. And glorious. I think it’s blue. And I think… [laughter] …it has a golden hue around it. I think after a while,',\n",
              "  ' my dad would go, “Can I touch that?” [laughter] And God’s like, “Of course.” “You are one of my children.” [chuckles] [laughter] [laughter swells] Then he goes, “Thanks. That was neat.” [laughter] And then God says, “Do you want to see it snow?” [imitates sexual moaning] [laughter] That’s what snow is. You didn’t know that? Snowing. Good. I hope I ruined snow for you. Now… [laughter] It took me six months of pretty intense rehab, PT and OT. Shout-out to all the PTs and OTs in the world working with people. Fantastic. [applause] Well, they worked with me so that I could move around again normally and naturally. And then this always gets me, you guys. Seven months to the day, to the day, after I was injured, I was at home. I was asleep. It was two o’clock in the morning. And I heard my wife scream, but, like, a real scream. You know, like… [muted panicked screaming] So I took a pillow, I turned, and I covered this ear. Right? [laughter] “I am trying to sleep.” And then she starts calling me out by name. She’s like, “Tom?” “Tom?” And I go, “Goddammit.” [laughter] “This sounds real.” So I got up, I made myself something to eat. [laughter] Poured a drink. And I was like, “All right.” “Let’s go find her.” [laughter] Now, it’s 2:00 a.m. I… I can’t see anything. I’m just following her cries for help. And I finally find her sitting at the bottom of the stairs. And I go, “What are you doing?” She goes, “I think I sprained my ankle.” [laughter] I turn the light on, and I see that the bone that should be like this… [clicks tongue] …is like that. [audience groans] And I go, “That… [laughingly] …is not a sprain.” [laughter] “I’m sure of it.” [laughter] And she goes, “What should I do?” I said, “You should do nothing.” “I will call 911.” [laughter] I have to confess I was very, very excited to call 911. [laughter] Have you ever been excited to call? Like, “Finally, a good one.” You know? Like… “This is why we play the game.” I call. The operator goes, “911.” And I’m so amped up, I go, “Get fuckin’ ready.” [laughter] [scattered applause] He’s like, “Okay.” [laughter continues] He goes, “You need police, fire, or paramedic?” I go, “Paramedic!” “But send ’em all!” And he was like, “What happened?” And I was like, “Ooh.” [laughter] And I realize that while what I’m about to say is true, it sounds… [high-pitched] …suspicious. [laughter] But I gotta say it. So I’m like, “My wife fell down the stairs.” [loud laughter] [cheers and applause] [cheers fading] The operator goes, “Uh-huh.” [laughter] He goes, “How’d that happen?” I was like, “I don’t fuckin’ know.” [laughter] He goes, “Was she alone?” I’m like, “Do I need to talk to a lawyer?” [laughter] Four paramedics show up. I open the door. They go, “What happened?” I go, “You know the deal.” [laughter] “My wife fell down the stairs.” And they go, “How’d it happen?” I go, “I do not know.” They’re like, “Was she alone?” I go, “Talk to my lawyer. He’s on the phone right now.” [crowd chuckling] Then they start tending to her. Lik',\n",
              "  'e, they put her leg in a brace. You know? Start giving her an IV. I lean over to her and I have a private conversation as you sometimes do. I go, “Hey, I wanna tell you something.” “I don’t like the way I’m being spoken to here.” [laughter] “I feel like everybody’s implying I had something to do with this.” “And I don’t like it.” And then I walked away. And a few moments later, she decided to make an announcement. [crowd chuckles] Unprompted. She goes, “Guys?” And they all turn. And she goes, “He would never hurt me.” And I’m like… [uproarious laughter] [scattered applause] “What are you doing?” [scattered cheers] She goes, “We’ve been together a long time.” “And if you think he did this, he didn’t.” I go, “Shut the fuck up.” [laughter] “Or I will kill you.” [laughter] [scattered applause] Then we get to the hospital. Doctor’s like, “What happened?” I go, “I punched her in the mouth and she fell down the stairs.” [laughter] And he goes, “I get it, man. I get it.” [laughter] “She’s super chatty.” I go, “I know.” [laughter continues] “You should see her at home.” No, she’s doing better now. She learned. She gets it, you know. [laughter] [scattered applause] “Sandwich at 6:00.” All right. So… [laughs softly] [crowd chuckling] She came to a show and saw me tell that story, and she was like, “Can you imagine if you had hit me?” And I was like, “Uh… yeah.” [laughter] Don’t feel bad for her, okay? I’m serious. I just did her a huge solid. She asked me to do this and I did it. She asked me to get a vasectomy and I did it. So I got snipped. Yeah. [women cheering] See? The women always cheer and there’s always one guy that boos. [laughter] Like he wanted my full load all up inside of him. [laughter] Listen, if you’re a guy and you’re thinking about doing it, do it. It’s a routine procedure. You will be nervous the morning of. It’s your balls. [crowd chuckling] You lay on a table. It’s very cold. It’s, like, 400 below zero. And… [laughter] They pull up your dress very dramatically. They’re like, “What’s going on down here?” [laughter] Your dick just stares at you, like, “How could you?” You know? [laughter] But it’s over in 15 minutes, which I think is remarkable. And then you go back a week later for the follow-up. And the follow-up is just a urologist checking you out. Goes, “All right, drop your shorts.” Like, “All right…” [inquisitive humming] [laughter] [moaning softly] [laughter] He goes, “Yeah, it tastes the same.” You know? [laughter] [audience murmuring, chuckling] He says, “I’m gonna give you your homework.” Those are his words. “I’m gonna give you your homework.” I go, “What’s my homework?” He goes, “Go home, ejaculate 20 times.” “Bring in your 21st sample in this cup, and we’ll test it and let you know if you’re clear.” I was like, “That ain’t shit.” You know? [laughter] [scattered applause] I do my homework all the time, baby. So… [laughter] [cheering] He goes to leave, but he stops at the door. He goes, “Oh! I almost forgot to tell you.” “Take your tim',\n",
              "  'e.” And I said, “I was gonna.” [laughter] And then he says, “Sometimes I forget to tell people.” Which tells me that some people have returned rather quickly. [laughter] With their assignment. So I immediately ask him. I go, “What’s the fastest anyone’s done 20 ejaculations?” [laughter] He goes, “48 hours.” And I was like… [audience groans] “That motherfucker can keep that record. I don’t want anything to do with that.” [laughter] “That’s the champ champ right there.” [laughter] I went home and took another week off. I was black and blue. I was sore. Like, “All right.” But after the week, it’s time to get going. I started slowly, you know. I was like… [laughter] “Wake up.” Didn’t feel the same. It was strange. Different. You know? I could feel the system turning on. You know what it reminded me of? You know when you run the heat for the first time in the winter? And you’re like, “This smells weird, man.” Like… [laughter] I could feel it building up. And I could not get this one intrusive thought out of my head, which was, “It’s just gonna be blood that comes out.” [audience groans] I didn’t want it to be. [laughter] I just kept thinking it. So now I’m jerking off all scared. Like… [exaggerated whimpering] [sorrowfully] “It’s gonna be blood!” [laughter] But I pushed through. I kept going. And… [laughter] …when it finally did go, it wasn’t blood. And in relief, I laughed. [crowd chuckles] So my first jack back was me going… [laughs maniacally] [laughter] [applause] Yeah. Well… [crowd cheering] [cheers and applause continuing] Instagram took it down, but it’s on my OnlyFans if you wanna see it. [laughter] Six bucks a month. Now… The only thing, uh, that could deal with that specific type of pain when I had the vasectomy was eating edibles. You know? I had to eat edibles every day for that achy, weird pain. Yeah. I always feel like I have to confess to people immediately when I tell them, like, that I like edibles, and that is because I am a lightweight and I like mild edibles. Some people wanna eat edibles… [applause] You know, yeah. And… Some people wanna peek into the third dimension casually every day. [cheering] That’s not me. All right? I like five and ten milligrams, and people… [cheering] Sure. [applause] People mock me and they call me “10 Milligram Tom” and this bullshit. [laughter] Yell it to me on the street. Like, “Are you eating your baby edibles?” And I go, “Yes. Because I like to be able to speak.” “Is that crazy to you?” [scattered cheers] “You don’t know people that like a couple beers?” Is it always, “I like to drink 36.” “Okay. Good for you, Bert.” “Have a great night.” So… [raucous cheering] [cheering fades] [guffaws mockingly] [laughter] [scattered cheers and applause] [mockingly] “I’m the mechanic!” Or whatever. [laughter] [crowd cheering] Yeah. [cheering continues] Bert. [audience member whistles] Well… “We forgot how the story goes. Tell it again.” Now… [laughter] [chortles] That’s my bestie. [laughter] Speaking of friends, you never…',\n",
              "  ' I wanna make this clear. If you drink, if you smoke, if you inject things into your eyeballs, you never have to worry about strangers. Never push the myth that a stranger might be culpable in getting you fucked up. People say it, like, “What if a stranger spikes my drink?” “What if a stranger hands me a joint and it’s laced?” Guess what? It’ll never be a stranger. It’ll be one of your friends. Okay? [laughter] Your friends will fuck you the hardest. [laughter] I know this firsthand. I have a bunch of really cool friends. Um… I found out on this tour that one of my friends was in the same city as I was in on the same night. Very rare in this line of work. I was in Miami. I find this out. I cancel our dinner plans. I drive across town. I walk into this club and I see my good friend. Some of you know him. He’s a comedian and podcaster. His name is Joey Diaz. Now… [resounding cheers] [audience member whistles] [cheers fade] If you’re here and don’t know who that is, please allow me to describe him to you. [laughter] Joey is a very funny man. He’s a… He’s a comedian. He’s 60 years old. He’s a Cuban immigrant. Uh, he weighs 295. And… he sort of looks like if somebody was making a person and then they left him under a heat lamp for like 15 minutes. [crowd groans, chuckling] As a side note, I feel like I should point out he was addicted to cocaine and heroin for 20 years. I think that’s relevant to the story. Now… [crowd chuckling] Joey’s very affectionate. I get to this place and he gives me a great big hug. And the first thing he says to me, he goes, “I got you something.” [crowd chuckles] I go, “You got me something? What did you get me?” He goes, “I know you like your tens. You’re 10 Milli Tom.” [laughter] “I got you some tens.” And I go, “No, you didn’t.” [laughter] He goes, “I did.” I go, “No, you didn’t.” He goes, “Why are you saying that?” “‘Cause you’re a liar and a bad person.” “You’re lying right now.” [laughter] He goes, “No, I’m not.” I go, “Sure you are.” And he has a jar, and he pours five gelcaps into his hand. And he goes, “These are tens.” And I go, “Bullshit.” [laughter] And then he goes… [gulps] [laughter] Eats all five. Like they’re Skittles. [laughter] So then I go, “Huh. Maybe they are tens.” [laughter] [scattered applause] I said, “I would like one.” I put it on my tongue. I take a sip of water. As it goes down, I look at him. He goes, “Oh!” [laughter] I go, “How much did I just take?” And he goes, “Ten.” And he just walks out of the room. [laughter] I’m watching him perform. You know, 30 minutes in, I have a buzz. When the show’s over, I am out… of my goddamn mind. [laughter] I am vibrating like a tuning fork. I’m like… [imitates pulsing vibration] [laughter] I can’t open my eyes. I’m like… [laughter] I have to put my hand on a man’s shoulder to guide me across the room. I’m like… [laughter] I go… [clenched] “Joey, we gotta get the fuck outta here.” And we do. Do you know where we go? To the airport. Yay. [laughter] Let’s have a panic at',\n",
              "  'tack in a tube in the sky. I’m walking through Miami International Airport freaking people the fuck out. All right? You know why? I forget how to walk. I forget how to walk. I can’t figure out the fuckin’ body scanner thing. I’m like… [snickers] [laughter] [nervously] “Can you hear my heartbeat too?” [titters] [laughter] [scattered applause] I’m sweating, but I’m cold. You know? Asking everyone for blankets, like, “Do you have a blanket?” “I want a blanket!” They’re like, “You’re on the toilet. Get the fuck outta here.” [laughter] I pass out in a meditative state. On this flight. I do. Then I just wake up scared. You ever wake up just terrified? Like, I sit up and I’m like, “Ah!” [laughter] “Why am I a bad person?” [laughter] And I do something I’ve never done. A flight attendant passes down the aisle, and as she passes, I grab her arm. Hard. Like I’m gonna put it on my dick. Like, I grab it. [laughter] And she’s stunned. So she goes… [exclaims] [laughter] And I’m so fucked up, I go, “Wait, how come? Do you know?” [raucous laughter] “Why are we alive?” And she’s like, “What? What?” Now luckily I have a decent friend with me, Shaun. He interjects, goes, “He took an Ambien.” She’s like, “Okay.” She just keeps going down the aisle. [laughter] Now he’s worried about me, so he wakes Joey up. He goes, “Joey!” And Joey’s like, “What?” He goes, “What did you give Tom?” He goes, “I gave him 200 milligrams.” [audience exclaims, laughs] “Dipped in hash oil.” [audience exclaiming] I go… [slurred] “Why you do that to me?” [laughter] He goes, “You’re gonna see the devil now, bitch.” [laughter] [resounding cheers and applause] [audience member whistles] [applause fades] I go, “I think I’m fuckin’ looking at him.” [laughter] And let’s rewind, by the way. He took five. He’s on a thousand milligrams. Like… [yawns] “What are you doing tomorrow?” “I’m going to the hospital tomorrow. What are you doing?” Psycho. [crowd chuckling] But listen to me. If you have never been surprise megadosed, it is horrific. [laughter] It is a harrowing, panic-induced terror ride. And so a few weeks ago, I did it to my mother. Uh… [laughter] [scattered cheers, applause] I did. I was visiting her. She’s alone. She knows I eat them at night. I’ve told her they help me sleep, which they do. And she calls them “gummies.” So… She comes up to me and she’s like… [slightly accented] “Are you going to have a gummy tonight?” And I go, “Yes.” She goes, “May I have one?” And I was like… [laughs] “Yeah.” [laughter] I give her one because I take one. And one gets me high, so I’m like, “This is gonna peel back her wig.” You know? [laughter] I sit around with her for a couple hours. Then I ask her, “How do you feel?” She goes… [with emphasis] “I feel nothing.” [laughter] Like, “Really?” She goes, “Yes.” I go, “All right. I don’t know. Go to bed, you fuckin’ savage.” “I don’t know what to tell you.” [laughter] The next day, it’s evening and she comes up to me again. [mimics accent] “May I have another gummy toni',\n",
              "  'ght?” I go, “You had one yesterday. You didn’t feel anything.” She goes, “Maybe I should take two.” [laughter] [clicks tongue] “Maybe you should.” [laughter] I give her two. We hang out. And again, I ask her, “How do you feel?” She goes… [with emphasis] “I feel nothing.” I’m like, “Really?” She goes, “Should I take two more?” I said, “Hey, Pablo, you might wanna keep it in first for a minute.” [laughter] She goes, “You don’t think so?” I go, “Actually, I do think so. Here. Here’s two more.” I give it to her. She eats them. And then she says, “I’m going to bed.” I go, “All right.” She goes to her room. I go to the guest room. A few minutes later… [crowd chuckles] …I receive a series of text messages that I have since memorized. [laughter] The first one says, “Tommy, I am fizzing.” [laughter] F-I-Z-Z… I-N-G. I write back, “Sounds cool.” [laughter] ‘Cause who the fuck is like, “I’m fizzing right now”? [laughter] [scattered applause, cheers] “We out here fizzing tonight, baby.” I don’t know what that is. She writes back, “My heart rate is 125.” [crowd chuckles] “Oh, I am spinning.” So I write, “LOL.” I think she’s having fun. [laughter] Then she writes, “Please come now. I don’t feel well.” I go into her room and my mother is seated upright. [laughter] In b… That is an alarming look. For an elderly woman? Most of them lay down or lean. She’s just in bed, like… [laughter] I go, “Are you okay?” She goes… [hoarsely] “No.” [laughter] So I take her out to the patio. I’m thinking, “Fresh air.” You know? It’s clear immediately that we are in for a ride. [laughter] The first thing she does, she goes… [smacks lips rapidly] [laughter] [mimics accent] “My lips!” “They are stuck together.” [laughter] [scattered applause] I go, “I’ll get you some water.” [crowd chuckling] And she goes, “Why am I hungry?” [laughter] I said, “‘Cause it’s working.” [laughter] And she goes, “The dog was here. The dog is gone?” And I go, “Oh my God.” [laughter] I start to laugh so… destructively hard. [laughter] It… It is not, “Ha-ha-ha.” It is a deep, primal… I’m watching my 77-year-old mother get high. I’m not laughing, my nervous system is shutting down, all right? [laughter] I mean, I’m watching her look at sounds. You know, she’s like… [laughter] It hurts. It hurts how hard… My esoph… I’m like… [raspy exhaling] As I’m laughing, I look at her. And at one moment, her face contorts. Her face goes… [laughter] And she looks at me. And she goes, “Tomorrow, your laughter will be tears on my corpse.” And I’m like… [audience exclaims] “What?!” She goes, “It’s the perfect murder.” [laughter] “Nobody will know it was you.” My lungs invert at this point. And I have tears streaming down my face. She’s so high, she thinks my laughter is confirming her thoughts. [laughter] She starts to legit plead for her life. [laughter continues] She goes, “Tommy, please!” “Please!” “Don’t kill me!” [laughter] “I am your mother!” [laughter continues] I fuckin’ pass out in a chair. I’m like… [grunts] [laughter] [appla',\n",
              "  'use] [resounding cheers] [applause fades] I wake. I don’t even know where the fuck I am. It’s morning. I walk into the kitchen at the same time as her. I go, “Hey, Mom.” And she doesn’t say anything. I’m like, “Oh, shit.” She just walks over to the coffee maker and she goes… [sucks teeth] “I know you tried to kill me last night.” [clamorous laughter] “It was very clever.” [laughter continues] “But I am still here, Tommy.” [laughter] I go, “I didn’t try to kill you.” She goes, “Oh yes, you did.” So I leave for the day. I come back later. I go, “Look, I owe you an apology.” “I should not have let you eat that much. I’m sorry.” She goes, “It’s okay. I forgive you.” I’m like, “Really? Thank you. Makes me feel better.” She goes, “I want to tell you one thing.” And I go, “What?” She goes, “I want another gummy tonight.” And I go, “What?” She eats them every day now. She’s doing coke. She grew her bush out. [laughter] She’s fuckin’ the neighbors. She’s living her best life. [cheering] If you ever meet her, give her drugs. Thank you guys very much for coming out.

              " ['[lively music playing] [announcer] Detroit, give it up… for Trevor Noah! [audience cheering] What’s going on, Detroit? Oh! How you doing tonight, everybody? How you doing? Welcome to the show. Thank you so much for coming out. Look at this. What a night. What a feeling. Here we are. Detroit, Michigan. We made it. [audience cheering and applauding] I’ve really been enjoying it. I’m enjoying everywhere, honestly. I’m having more fun in my life now than I think I’ve ever had. I’m enjoying America more now than I’ve ever, ever enjoyed it. Every day. I don’t even know what it is. I think it’s… You enjoy a place differently when it might be ending, you know? It just has a… It has a different feeling to it, like… “Mmm, what is that taste?” “The final season? Mmm-mmm-mmm” ‘Cause you never know with America. You really never know. Every day is the best day, and possibly the last day. I’m having an amazing time, I truly am. This year was such a blessing, because… I got to travel around the world, doing shows in places I had never performed before. Places I’ve always wanted to do comedy, I’ve always wanted to try it out. I did shows in Berlin, Germany, for the first time ever. That was really amazing. I won’t lie, people freaked me out before I went there. Similar to Detroit, where people are like, “Oh, watch out, Detroit.” People were like that with Germany as well. Like, when I was going to Berlin, people were like, “Dude, Germany?” “Do they even laugh?” I’m like, “What do you mean? They’re human beings.” “I don’t know, man. Do they laugh?” People got to me. At a point when I was heading to Germany, I was like, maybe Germans just sit in the audience, like, [in German accent] “Uh-huh. Ja, ja, uh-huh.” “That was a comedy show.” [normally] But they don’t. They laugh. They’re actually great audiences. I had an amazing time in Berlin. It’s a city that sneaks up on you, because it’s… It’s so culturally diverse. You know? It has a burgeoning art scene. Fantastic music. The history… The history in Berlin is truly deep and rich. I love traveling and seeing places whenever I’m in certain cities and in Berlin, I went out with a tour group and I had a great time. But I wish someone had warned me how painful a lot of Berlin’s history is. ‘Cause that was basically the headquarters of the Nazi Party. So everything ties back to Hitler. I didn’t know this. I thought we’re going on a cute little tour. I ask a lot of questions. I’m curious. This brought the mood down. We’re out and about. The tour guide was doing his schtick. He was happy as well. [in German accent] “Here, behind me, you can see, this is one of the largest airports that was ever built in the world.” “Ja, it is a world famous airport here in Berlin, and it is so large that we were able…” “They filmed the Hollywood movie The Hunger Games inside this airport.” “Ja, any questions?” [normally] I said, “Yeah. Wow. How old is this thing?” [in German accent] “This is almost 100 years old.” [normally] And I’m like, “Damn! Who built it?” [in German accent] “Yeah. That is the unfortunate part of the… of the story here.” “This airport was built by, uh, Hitler.” [in normal voice] I could see I’d messed things up. I tried to bring the mood up. I was like, “Which Hitler?” He says, [in German accent] “Which Hitler?” “Which other Hitler is there?” I was like, “Could be Henry Hitler.” “Henry Hitler?” “Who the hell is Henry Hitler?” I was like, “You don’t know Henry Hitler?” It didn’t work. Like, “Yo, man.” It was tense, but it was good. And what I mean by good… It was nice to be in a place wh',\n",
              "  'ere people don’t bury their history. What I mean by that… [audience applauding] What I mean by that is that when you travel through Germany, even if you don’t go to museums, you cannot escape the past of both Berlin and what Germany did. There are monuments scattered throughout the city. Prominent monuments. They are memorializing what Germany did to millions of Jewish people and other people around the world. You see it, you understand it, they talk about it. They teach their kids about it. They teach children in school. They’re like, “Hey, this is what Germany did.” They make sure they know. But they don’t make them feel guilty about it. Which is an amazing balance for them to strike. They’ll say to the kids, they’re like, “Hey, kids. I hope you understand.” “Germany did this.” “You’re not responsible because you weren’t there.” “However, because you’re the future of Germany, it’s your responsibility to make sure this doesn’t happen again.” [audience cheering and applauding] You know, what I loved about being in Germany when they were talking about their history is how forthright they are about it. They know it’s painful. They know that it’s a terrible blight on who they are, but they don’t hide from it. When I saw them doing this, I went, “Man, I wish America did this with history.” You know? ‘Cause you… You ever see how awkward it is, speaking about history in America? It gets tense. Doesn’t matter what history it is. It gets tense. Columbus Day is one of those days. Every year in New York, there’s a fight. Here in Detroit, there was a fight. There was a bust of Christopher Columbus, was around for 110 years. At a point, half of Detroit was like, “We need to get rid of it.” The other half said, “Don’t get rid of it.” It was a huge fight. New York, same thing, every year. Columbus Day, Indigenous Peoples’ Day. Columbus Day, Indigenous Peoples’ Day. There was an interview on the news I saw once. [chuckles] It wasn’t supposed to be funny, but I found it funny. The reporter went to a guy and asked, “What will you be doing for Indigenous Peoples’ Day?” He was like, [Italian-American accent] “It’s Columbus Day, I’m sick and tired of people coming in and changing the name.” “We’re proud of that day.” “It’s Christopher Columbus. Columbus Day. It’s not gonna change.” “In fact, how would you feel if somebody came along, took something that’s been around for a long time, and just decided to switch it and call it something else?” “Huh? How would you feel?” [in normal voice] I was like, “But, sir, isn’t that the spirit of Columbus Day?” I’ll be honest. I’m not a big fan of Indigenous Peoples’ Day. The title, I don’t like… I think it’s a cop-out. I don’t think it’s specific enough. It’s lazy. “Indigenous Peoples’ Day.” Which Indigenous people? Where? How? Give me something. You know what I liked about Columbus Day? It’s that it was specific. Yeah. It was a specific, inspiring story of a man by the name Christopher Columbus who believed, against all odds, that he could sail the wrong way around the world and get to India from the other side. Nobody believed in him. Yeah. He said, “I’m gonna do this.” They said, “You can’t do it, Chris.” He was like, “I will.” They’re like, “You can’t do it!” He said, “I will!” They said, “You can’t!” And he raised money, he fought for years, he finally got the ships. And he sailed the wrong way around the world and he didn’t do it. Not only did he not land on the other side of India, he found himself in a place called the Caribbean. And he was like, “This is India.” And the people went, [in ',\n",
              "  'Caribbean accent] “I don’t know if you’ve been eating some of the herb we’ve been leaving about, but this is totally not India.” He was like, “This is India and you guys are Indians.” They’re like, “Brother, we are not Indians.” He’s like, “I know Indians when I don’t see them.” “You’re Indians, just on the far side.” “So you’re West Indians.” And he stuck with it. Christopher Columbus stuck with it his entire life. Other explorers would come to him like, “Yo, Chris.” “I don’t think you made it to India.” He’s like, “It’s India.” They’re like, “I don’t think it’s India.” He’s like, “It’s India.” He died refusing to acknowledge the possibility that he never made it to India. Not only that, my friends, he never set foot in America, ever. Ever. And yet, he had a public holiday named after him in America. That, my friends, is the inspiring story of how white men can fail up. Do you know how much confidence you have to have to pull that off? Nobody else. That is white man confidence. Nobody else possesses that level of confidence. Go the wrong way. End up in the wrong place. Call the wrong people the wrong name and be like, “I’m right.” “Give me a holiday.” No one else can do that. That is the level of confidence we should all aspire to, is white man levels of confidence. Women couldn’t pull that off. If a woman said, “I’ll sail the wrong way around the Earth.” They’ll be like, “Burn her. She’s a witch!” You think people of color could pull that off? You think Black people could? Wow, really? Like he was gonna sail around the world the wrong way around. Get to the place they’re not supposed to be. Probably get arrested for trespassing. Like, “What are you doing here?” [in African-American accent] “My bad, I thought I was getting to India.” “Man, I don’t know what I was thinking.” “We should’ve never messed with ships. It never turns out good.” “I apologize. I apologize, man.” “This won’t happen again.” Why would you wanna bury your history? There’s so much joy and so much to learn. You know? It feels like America is moving in that direction. It wants less and less of its history, less and less context. You look what’s happening with textbooks. Places like Florida, they wanna ban textbooks or cut out the parts of the textbooks that have slavery in the books. And now parents are fighting. They’re like, “No, no, take the slavery out. It’s making the kids feel bad.” Other parents are like, “Keep the slavery in.” “It teaches children.” And they’re fighting back and forth. I’m like, “Why?” You don’t need to be fighting about… No one should be fighting about this. Kids don’t read textbooks. They watch TikTok. If you wanna get to the kids, that’s where you gotta be. ♪ There was slavery ♪\\n♪ Ships came ♪\\n♪ Yeah… ♪ I’ll be honest. I don’t think that textbook thing is like a real issue. I feel like it’s one of those manufactured issues that often happens in America that gets people riled up and gets them fired up, fighting about something that was never an issue to begin with. I say this because that’s honestly what I believe. I feel like in America, politicians have done a really good job of tricking Americans into fighting about issues that were never an issue to begin with, so that you don’t pay attention to the issues that actually are. You know? If you’re fighting about what’s in a textbook, you don’t pay attention to the fact that inflation is out of control. You don’t pay attention that rents are out of control. People cannot afford to live anywhere. Salaries have never kept up with inflation. Corporations steal billions an',\n",
              "  'd billions of dollars from their employees with no ramifications. You don’t pay attention to any of that. You pay attention to what’s catchy, what’s easy to keep up with. It keeps you going, you know? “Ooh, can trans people use public bathrooms?” “Ooh!” It’s manufactured. Who was dealing with this issue? Honestly. Who was actually dealing with this issue? You know what they did? Some politician figured out, they go, “Here’s a small story affecting a few people in a random place.” “I’ll make it seem like a nationwide issue, then everyone starts fighting.” But who was dealing with it? Who has ever been in a situation where you were in a bathroom, and all of a sudden a skirmish broke out and people go, “Excuse me, is this the gender that you were born with?” “Does it coincide with the sign on the door?” “Is your genitalia matching this?” “Can I see it?” Who’s ever seen that? Nobody. Nobody. But they make us fight about it because it’s catchy. “Who can use which bathroom.” Who cares? Who cares? I mean it, who cares? I know some would be like, “Trans people care.” They wanna know if they can use a public bathroom. Yeah, use whichever bathroom you want. Who’s gonna stop you? No, seriously, it’s a public toilet. Who is going to stop you? You tell me who’s gonna enforce that law? We can’t even enforce the idea that people should shit into the toilet. But you think magically they’re gonna figure out if you were born this way. Use whichever one you want. Why are we wasting our time? Other people are like, “We’ll fight because you gotta know who’s…” Let me tell you something. If you are spending enough time to know the genitalia of the other people in a public bathroom, you’re the creep. I’m worried about you. There is a simple rule to every public toilet around the world. And that rule is, you get in, pay no attention to anyone else, hold your breath and you get out. Quit standing around staring at other people. Every man in this room knows when we use the toilet, we get in, public toilet, you stare dead ahead, you pee, do your thing. Do not look to either side. If you’re fidgety, look up, look down. You do not look at anyone else. The guy next to you can start choking. You don’t turn your head. You don’t shake, you don’t move. You hear him, like… [mimics choking] You be like, “Hey, man, hey. Hey.” “Hey, you all right? Yo, yo.” “Hey, man, you okay?” “Yo, yo. You want me to call… Hey, man, are you okay?” [mimics choking] “You wanna call… “”Don’t look at me!” What are we doing? What are we fighting about? Public bathrooms. If you know your history, you know this happens all the time in America. It happens over and over and over again. There was a time when women had to fight to use public bathrooms in America. Imagine that. There was literally a time when women weren’t allowed to use public bathrooms all across America and they had to fight. And there were men who were angry. They were like, “This is crazy.” “You’re gonna have women in public bathrooms? That’s insane!” “How does it work, huh?” “What, they’re gonna come in there while we’re peeing?” “And then what? They’re gonna look at our wieners?” “And they’re gonna laugh, huh?” Think about this, ladies. There was a time when women were first allowed to step into the workplace, where there were no public bathrooms they could use. So, ladies, if you were out and about back then, you needed to pee, you needed to poo, you had to go home. Yeah. And I say poo theoretically, I don’t know if you actually do. No, I don’t think any guy does. Let’s be honest. We don’t. We assume this',\n",
              "  ' on a biological level, but I don’t know for certain that any woman actually… In fact, any man in here, think of any woman in your life. Do you know the last time she pooed? I don’t think you know. I don’t think you know. There is no forensic evidence to back up that claim. There is no smell. There is no stain. There is no nothing. Ladies, I don’t know who does your bathroom PR, but they are doing a stellar job. Stellar job. Women go to the bathroom, smells better when they come out of it. How? You never know when a lady is pooing. Never. Because also, women keep the same amount of time. That’s the most impressive thing. You give nothing away. Yeah, a woman’s gonna go pee, it takes ten minutes. She goes to the bathroom. All right. Gets there, tinkle, tinkle, tinkle, comes out, washes her hand, powders her face, texts on the phone, comes back to the table. You have no clue. Yeah. She’s gonna go poo, same thing, ten minutes. Goes to the bathroom, pellets, pellets, pellets, comes back out. Wash her hands, powder the nose, text her friends. Get back out there. You have no clue. With men, you know exactly what we’re doing. Discretion is not our forte. You know when every single man is gonna go pee. Why? Two minutes. Off to the bathroom, we’re in there. Quickest thing ever. It’s like a NASCAR pit stop. Yeah, we get in, we pee, we come back out, act like we’re washing our hands and we’re back. How do you know when we take a dump? ‘Cause it’s obvious. We go to the bathroom, never come back. That’s the last time you’ll ever see us. Your family’s putting up wanted posters in the restaurant. “Have you seen this man?” Imagine, people were fighting about bathrooms every time in America. Every time. There was a time when Black people had to fight to use public bathrooms. Huh. Same thing. Black people were like, “Why can we not use public bathrooms?” And again, people were angry. “This is crazy.” “You’re gonna have Black people in this in a public bathroom?” “How does that even work, huh?” “So what? They’re gonna be standing there while I pee, huh?” “They’re gonna be looking at my wiener? Huh?” “And they’re gonna laugh? Huh?” I’m old enough to remember when there was a discussion in America about whether gay people could use public bathrooms. This was an actual topic of discussion. I remember people on the news being interviewed. “Do you think gay men should be allowed into the same bathrooms as straight men?” They’ll be like, “I don’t mind what they do, if they keep it to themselves, that’s fine.” “But just answer me this. Answer me this. How is it gonna work?” “So what? You’re in the bathroom with them and then what?” “He’s gay and I’m just standing there and I’m peeing, huh?” “And he’s looking at my wiener? Huh?” “And then he grabs it, huh?” “And he starts yanking on it, huh?” “He just starts tugging away and I get hard and I’m enjoying it, huh?” “And then this is one of the best experiences I’ve ever had, huh?” “And then I start coming back weekly hoping I’ll bump into him and I do, huh?” “And then at some point we agree to meet outside, a nice little restaurant that’s cozy and get to know each other, huh?” “And then a few years later, we get married and our families are joined and we live happily ever after?” “Is that what you want?” Wow. Public bathrooms. It’s why you shouldn’t bury your history. If you know what’s happened, you know what to predict. You understand why it happened in the first place. Germany does that in a truly astounding way. It will never be perfect. But Germany is one of the only countries in the world',\n",
              "  ' that has actively paid reparations for what they did. One of the only countries in the world that has actively apologized and one of the only countries in the world that’s set about changing how they see themselves and how the world sees them. After World War II, Germany changed a bunch of laws. They changed the iconography of the country. What you could hang, where you could hang it. They changed their national anthem. Yeah, imagine that, they changed the national anthem. They felt that the national anthem was a nationalist song that the Nazis used to inspire people to think the wrong things. They changed it. The original song was called “Deutschland, Deutschland über alles.” You’ve probably heard it in old movies or whatever. The song went like… [singing in German] And translated into English, it means… ♪ Germany, Germany over everything ♪\\n♪ Over everything in the world ♪ And clearly they meant it. Yeah, where most anthems are theoretical, the Germans are precise. But after World War II, they were like, “We can’t have that same attitude.” And so they changed the anthem. And new lyrics. The new lyrics are… [singing in German] Which translated into English is… ♪ Unity and rights and freedom ♪\\n♪ For all the people who live in Germany ♪ Which… Which is adorable. It’s adorable. They may as well have made the song… ♪ Sorry, sorry We’re so, so sorry ♪\\n♪ Sorry, sorry, sorry for what we did ♪ I appreciate that they did it, but I wouldn’t have gone that far. I won’t lie. I wouldn’t have gone that far. I think über alles is terrible. That’s not a good way to think. But you still gotta have a bit of kick in your anthem. You still gotta have a… I would’ve found a middle ground. Mine would have been… [in German] ♪ Germany Germany, somewhere… ♪ [in English]…in the top five. [in German] ♪ Not over everything in the world ♪ [in English] ♪ Because we are definitely In the top five ♪ ♪ When you think about it ♪ ♪ America’s number one ♪ ♪ And then you have Great Britain And then you have France and Spain ♪ ♪ And then we are at number five… ♪ Actually, Spain is not better than us. ♪ So we are number four ♪ ♪ Number four in the… ♪ Yeah, but France, their economy is not that strong. ♪ So, maybe we are number three In the world ♪ ♪ Then you have England above… ♪ Oh, wait, oh, Brexit was not a smart idea. ♪ So maybe if we are number two And America is number… ♪ Oh, the elections are not that stable. So… Then maybe we are über alles of the world! [chuckles] [in normal accent] It’s one of the biggest things they did, and nobody knows that they did it. I was chatting to a German guy. And he was perplexed by this. Absolutely perplexed. He said… [in German accent] “In Germany we’ve done so many things.” “The national anthem was a big change for us.” “I’m sure the whole world talks about this.” [in normal accent] I said, “Nope.” [sighs] He was like, “What do you mean?” “What do you mean? Who doesn’t talk about it?” I was like, “Nobody. Nobody talks about it.” “Who’s nobody?” I was like, “Nobody. No one.” “No one outside of Germany even knows this.” “How can they not know?” I was like, “What do you mean?” “It’s German. No one speaks German outside Germany.” “How would anyone know?” “Also, you guys did something weird.” “You changed the lyrics, but you kept the beat.” It’s a strange move. [in German accent] You’re like, “This song is terrible, and we’re changing it.” “Ja. What about the beat?” “No, we are keeping that ’cause I’ve learned all the moves. Ja.” [normally] That’s probably why most people don’t know it changed. You’ve kept the beat.',\n",
              "  ' Most people don’t know the lyrics. We just know the beat. No one knew Michael Jackson was saying, “You’re a vegetable.” None of us knew that. Some of you are like, “When did he say ‘vegetable’?” Been singing it your whole life… ♪ You’re a vegetable ♪ No one knows lyrics. We just know the beat. That’s what Germany did. It’s weird. It’s weird to not change the music. ‘Cause the music comes with emotion. I was trying to explain this to him. He didn’t get it. And I realized, you know what it’s like. What Germany did, it would be like if in Star Wars, right? You know Star Wars. All right, let’s say, Darth Vader. Whenever Darth Vader came into a scene, whenever he landed on one of those planets, you always knew something was about to go down, something bad, because he had his music. All right? The music told you what was gonna happen. The ship would land… [imitates whooshing] Door would open… [imitates electric hum] And he’d be standing there. [imitates strained breathing] But he would never… He would never come into the game without his song playing. Never. He’ll be there, DJ on the side, like, [mimics Darth Vader] “DJ, play my jam.” [imitates record scratching] [mimics “The Imperial March”] “That’s right.” “Uh-huh.” And then you knew it was about to go down. Get down there… [mimics Darth Vader] “Kneel before me, Jedi.” [in high-pitched voice] “We’ll never kneel before you.” [mimics lightsabers whooshing] “You cannot defeat me.” “He’s so strong. I don’t know if we’re gonna win.” [mimics Yoda] “Defeat him, we shall.” [continues mimicking lightsabers] “Use the Force, we will.” [mimicking Darth Vader] “Ahh, you have defeated me!” “We did it, Master Yoda! We did it! “We defeated Darth Vader!” [mimics Yoda] “Indeed, we have.” “What do we do now?” “Free the Empire, we shall.” “Travel around, the good news we shall spread.” “Let’s do it.” “Yes, a new song we shall play.” [mimics “The Imperial March”] “You’re free.” [mimics “The Imperial March”] [in normal voice] It’s weird. It’s still impressive, though. Still impressive. Changing your national anthem is no small thing. It truly isn’t. Changing anything. We were having this conversation. And afterwards, he said something interesting, he’s like, [in German accent] “Because we saw how Germany had to change how it saw itself in order to change what it did, it’s why we changed the anthem.” I was like, “That’s powerful.” He’s like, “Do you think America would ever change…” I was like, “Don’t even finish that sentence.” “You don’t even finish that sentence.” If there’s one thing I’ve learned, America hates change. Whoo! America does not like change. You wanna change the things Germany changed? The money, the flags, the anthem. Are you kidding me? Remember when they tried to change the $20 bill? Remember that? They said they’d put Harriet Tubman on the bill. People got so angry, they postponed it indefinitely. People were furious. “What are you doing?” “We’re putting Harriet…” “How dare you?” “How dare you take an American president off the $20?” “How dare you take…” “Who’s on the $20?” “How dare you take Andrew Jackson off the $20 bill?” “They’re just putting Harriet Tubman on the front, and Andrew Jackson will be on the back.” “You’re putting an American president on the back? On the back?” “That’s disrespectful!” It’s not, really. If you know your history, you would know, Andrew Jackson would love to be on the back side of a Black woman, so I don’t know why you’re so stressed. I feel like everybody wins. People were furious, though. And now you’re gonna suggest changing the flag',\n",
              "  '? Suggest changing the anthem? Whoo! There’s two things I’ve learned, living in America. It’s you respect the flag and you respect the anthem. I don’t know what it means. But I follow the rules. I say I don’t know what it means is because it’s confusing. You’ll meet people like, “You respect the flag!” and I get it. But then I’ll see those same people on July 4th, and they’ll be wearing the flag as underwear. Does that count? And you looked up and you were like, “That flag, these balls.” I would never suggest changing any of it. The anthem? Oh, no, never the anthem. Even though it could. Maybe it could do with a little change. It is a very violent anthem. And America struggles with violence, Maybe like a softer… It’s a violent anthem. It’s the only anthem I’ve ever heard that has bombs blowing up in it. Yeah. There are bombs and rockets in your national anthem. It’s like a Michael Bay movie in a song. Everything blowing up in slow motion. [imitates explosions] It’s almost like you’re threatening other countries as well. It’s like, “Yeah, bombs bursting and rockets were flaring.” “Try us.” It’s like a gangster rap, to be honest. It really is. The American anthem is like a gangster rap. It has all the same elements. It has the violence, it has the threats. You know how it’s similar to a gangster rap? The American anthem is the only anthem where you can put the word “bitch” at the end of any line and the song still makes sense. ♪ Gave proof through the night ♪\\n♪ That our flag was still there ♪\\n♪ Bitch ♪ I love the American national anthem, I won’t lie. It’s exciting, and I know all the words. I didn’t try, but I know them. It’s one of those songs that you hear so much that you know it. Sort of like ♪ Nationwide is on your side ♪ Same… Same thing. Don’t wanna know that. Don’t need to know that. Wish I could reclaim the space in my brain, but it’s there. America’s national anthem is like that, ’cause you hear it so much in America. Now, this is the only country I’ve ever ever lived in where you play the national anthem when there is no other country in attendance. It would be like basketball games, football games, beer pong games, national anthem. Which I know is normal if you’ve lived in America all your life. “What other way is there, Trevor?” I’ll tell you… I’ll tell you as somebody who comes from the rest of the world, that’s not a thing. It’s not. Most places in the world, you play the national anthem maybe once a year, on a national event, or when you’re competing against another country. Then you play it. ‘Cause the other country is there and you have to prove to your country that you’re loyal. That’s why you sing the song. ‘Cause countries are very insecure. You have to reassure them. Constantly reassuring. They should go to therapy, deal with their attachment issues, but they don’t. You only realize how insecure countries are when you leave your country. Have you ever left and come back? Have you seen the questions your country asks you? So insecure, so jealous. Just like, “Where have you been, huh?” “Where have you been? Which countries?” “So what? You have another country now?” “Is that what you’re doing, huh? Huh?” “Which stamps are these? Let’s see who’s been stamping your passport.” You’re like, “Damn, country. Let me get my privacy.” That’s why you only sing the anthem when there’s another country attending. The only time you do it. That’s what it’s for, to make your country feel good. All right? You know what national anthems are? National anthems are the geopolitical equivalent of that thing women do t',\n",
              "  'o us men. Like, ladies, you know that trick you have for that man in your life? Like, whenever his ego is bruised, and you have to you try and heal it. Every woman in this room has a trick that works on every man. And right now, I know a lot of the women are like, “Shut up, Trevor!” “Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!” It’s a beautiful, subtle technique. Yeah, you’ll be out having lunch or something, and some guy will come up to the table. He’s buff, works out, you know, looks really good. He’s like, “Oh, my God, Michelle? Michelle?” Like, “Oh, Justin? Oh, my God.” “Wow. How are you?” And you’re like, “Who the hell is Justin? What’s going on?” He’s like, “This is crazy. Twice in two weeks?” And you go like, “Twice? When was once? Who is this?” “I know. Oh, my God. How are you?” “I’m doing good. We gotta catch up. We gotta talk about college.” “I was thinking about it. We were so crazy in college.” “You remember that night?” “You went to college? What’s going on?” She can feel your ego slowly withering like a raisin in the sun. And she won’t look at you. She won’t make it a big thing. She’ll continue the conversation. But they’ll gently just put their hand on your thigh. And then just start rubbing it. She’ll carry on like nothing’s happening. “I know, those were crazy. I was a cheerleader. What are you gonna do?” “It’s just one of those.” And the hand is going, “Shh. Shh, shh, shh.” “Shh. It’s okay. It’s okay.” “It’s okay, you’re a big man. Big man.” “Strong man. That’s right.” “There’s no other man in the world. Just you. Look at you. Wow.” “What a big man. Yeah.” “Who, this guy? I don’t even know who he is.” “Yeah, no, with his muscles.” “Oh, I don’t like muscles, no.” “I hate muscles. They’re disgusting.” “Look at him, all working out and everything’s in shape and bulging.” “No, it’s disgusting.” “What, six-packs? No, I don’t want a six-pack.” “I don’t like six-packs. That’s why I like you.” Boop! That’s what a national anthem is. You reassuring your country. The American anthem is such an interesting one. You know? Everything that represents America is the anthem. America has the most fun anthem rules in the world. Only country in the world where you’re allowed to sing the anthem however you want. However you want. You can’t do that anywhere else. Everywhere else, the anthem is the way it is written. It’s boring, and that’s the point. You can’t just change it. In America, you can do whatever you please. I noticed it the first time. The first time I noticed it was at a basketball game. It was the New York Knicks against the Toronto Raptors, right? And because the Raptors are from Canada, they had to play two national anthems before the game, which is rare. And so we’re in the arena and then the voice comes on. “Ladies and gentlemen, please stand for the Canadian national anthem.” And everybody stood, and then they just played, like, a tape somewhere. [chuckles] You could tell they didn’t care. And it was the song, the Canadian song. It’s always the same. ♪ O Canada… ♪ [humming gibberish] ♪ And something, something Brings us back to… ♪ [singing “Do-Re-Mi”] ♪ Do-do-do-do… ♪ [chuckles] You know the song, man. I don’t have time for that. Whatever. They sang the Canadian anthem. They were done. The announcer came back, “And now, ladies and gentlemen, please stay standing for the American national anthem.” And that’s my favorite part. Yeah, the lights will go dark. Someone walks to the middle of the arena. It’s always so intense, complete silence. [slowly] ♪ O say ♪\\n♪ Can you ♪\\n♪ See ♪\\n♪ By the dawn’s early light ♪ [vocalizi',\n",

So, Germany was fun. And then we headed to Paris, France, to do shows for the first time in my life, I was very excited. I always wanted to perform in Paris. Didn’t know what it would be. But can I tell you? Paris is everything they tell you it is. It is easily one of the most romantic cities I have ever been to in my life. I fell in love 1,000 times. I was by myself. It didn’t matter. Yeah. Every night, it was just me and those bedbugs, baby. I really enjoyed Paris because I got to meet Parisians. In person. Not stereotypes, not things you’re told about. No, actually meet French people, learn about them from them. And I learned some truly amazing things. For instance, the French have a very different relationship with work than the rest of us, all right? In that they don’t give a shit about it. Which, honestly, I found inspiring. Yeah. I feel like a lot of us have become a little too attached to our work, you know? We identify with our work. Ever asked somebody like, “Tell me about yourself”? “I’m an architect…” “Tell me about yourself.” “I own a hair salon and…” “Tell me about yourself.” “I’m a teacher…” “Tell me about yourself,” and people will tell you about what they do. You know, it’s become the thing that people focus on. The French don’t do that. No. You’ll never meet a French person who does that. You go up to a French person and be like, “Excuse me. What do you do?” Be like, [in French accent] “Oh, me? I go for walks with my friends and, uh… I like to eat good food and…” [in normal voice] You’re like, “No, what do you do for a living?” “For a living? Pardon.” “Okay, for a living.” “Okay, no, I, uh, breathe and, uh…” “You know, I drink water and, uh, you know…” “Of course, I have to make love, you know.” [in normal voice] It’s just a different way to be, man. You know, not being so attached to your work. It was lovely. I learned this because when I flew to Paris, my luggage was lost. All right? Yeah. Landed in the airport, and bags were gone, didn’t arrive. I discovered this at the carousel, which is a shitty thing that airlines do to you. They know your bags are not coming. Yeah, they know where your bag is every single moment. But they don’t tell you. They’ll let you stand there like an idiot with hope in your heart. They could come to your seat before take-off and be like, “It’s not coming.” “Spoiler alert.” But they don’t. [chuckles] They let you take off with all that joy like an idiot. Whee! I landed in Paris. Thought it was the beginning of a great trip. I was skipping around. I had my full-luggage swag, “I’m going get my bags, go into Paris, start exploring.” Got to the carousel. I was like, “Mmm-mmm, full luggage swag.” “That’s right. Let me get my luggage, everybody.” I was like, “Excuse me.” “Make space, please.” “I would like to lean over the carousel.” “Makes the bags come quicker.” “Come on, lucky bag.” I had full luggage swag. Bags started coming out and I was standing there, judging them. “Ha-ha! Who still uses Samsonite?” [laughs] “Ah! Where’s my bag?” Bags going around, going around, and then new bags stopped coming out. I started worrying. Then there were fewer ',\n",
              "  'and fewer bags. And I was like, “Oh, my bag…” “My bag’s not coming.” And I realized my bag hadn’t arrived. It was terrible. I had the same feeling, the same feeling I had as a child when my mom would forget me at school. Exactly the same. Standing at the carousel, felt like I was ten years old again, like… [exaggeratedly imitates a child crying] [sobbing] “No, Mr. Wilkinson, it’s fine, you can go.” “My mom’s going to come. Don’t worry, you can go home.” “She’s coming. She wouldn’t forget me.” “No… She’s…” “She’s probably dead somewhere right now.” “She’s probably in a ditch lying dead.” [in normal voice] She forgot me. She’d forget me occasionally. And then I’d have to walk home. It was like an hour walk. [laughs] And I’d get home, and she’d always have the same reaction when I walked in, ’cause she worked from home. She’d have a little computer where she’d be typing away, and I’d walk into the house and I’ll close the door like… Always the same reaction, she’ll be like… [gasps] “No, no, no, no, no, baby, no! No, no, no, no! Oh!” “What time is it?” And I’ll be like, “It’s too late.” I’m not going to lie. I hated being forgotten at school, but I savored those moments. ‘Cause it wasn’t any sweat, to be honest. I liked walking. It’s not like I was stressed on the walk. I’d be kicking stones, singing on the way back. I’d get to the house and be like, “No, wait a minute. Hmm.” I loved it ’cause that was the one moment when I was allowed to give my mom unlimited attitude with no repercussions. None. ‘Cause when I was a kid, you couldn’t give attitude to your parents. I wasn’t a white child. You know what I mean? You couldn’t… I had to watch myself. But when she messed up, ooh, I loved it. She’d be like, “Can you forgive me, baby?” I’ll be like, “I’ll think about it.” Now I had to find somebody to help me. I look around, there’s an older French gentleman standing on the side, gray hair, rosy cheeks, short little guy with glasses. So I walked over to him. And he was wearing a red vest. And in French, it read “Information,” and then underneath in English said, “Information.” I was like, “Phew!” “Ah. Bonjour. Hello. Hi.” He’s like, “Hello. Bonjour.” I said, “English, French?” Said, “English, yeah, oui.” I said, “Could you help me, please?” “Um… My, um… My luggage didn’t arrive.” “Um, I would like to know, what do I need to do?” He’s like, “There’s your luggage… It didn’t come…” [incoherent English in French accent] [in normal voice] I was like, “Okay.” Um… “All right.” “Let’s try French.” “Let’s, uh, see what happens.” Finally, we figured it out. He sent me off to a special area where you go and make a report. There’s another French guy behind the counter, much younger. He was maybe Algerian or Moroccan of descent. Very French, very French. Cool guy. He’s helping somebody. “Okay, thank you very much. Next, please.” I walk up, “Hey, man.” He’s like, “What’s going on, my brother?” “How are you? What’s up with you?” I was like, “I need your help, please.” “My luggage, um, it didn’t come. It’s, uh, lost.” He’s like, “Oh, no, dude, your luggage didn’t come.” “Oh, man.” “Did you look for it?” I said, “What? Yeah, that’s the first thing I did.” “You think I’m here for company?” “Of course, that’s…” He’s like, “No. Just checking.” “So, the bag is gone? It’s totally…” I’m like, “Yeah.” He’s like, “Oh, man, that sucks, man, I’m so sorry for you, man.” “That’s terrible.” “Yeah. So, what do you want to do now?” “What do I want to do?” I said, “I would like you to do something.” “Can we make a report or something?” “You want to make som',\n",
              "  \"e paperwork or something?” “It’s for your for your insurance so they can pay you for it?” I said, “No, it’s so that you can find it and bring it to me.” He’s like, “Oh, don’t worry, man.” “We are not going to find it.” “No, man.” “Don’t worry about that.” “No. You know, it’s Paris, man.” “When the bags are gone, they’re probably gone.” “They don’t ever pop up. Sometimes, if you’re lucky.” “But if it is not here by now, it’s probably gone.” “It’s Friday. There are some strikes. Just…” “You can leave. Don’t stress yourself. You can go.” It’s like, “Don’t even stress…” “Yo, It’s my luggage.” “That’s all my clothes.” He’s like, “But you are in Paris.” “You need clothes? This is Paris, man.” “Come on, Paris, go and buy some clothes.” “What’s wrong with you, man? Chill.” He was so confident, he made me feel like I was wrong. Like, I doubted myself. I walked away and I was like, “Am I wrong?” “Am I too attached to my luggage?” He wasn’t lying. Paris has a great selection of clothing. I had to go and buy clothes because I had nothing for my shows, for anything. And if you ever do go to Paris, take some extra money for the clothes shopping. It’s amazing. And try and also pack an extra pair of self-esteem. Yeah, you’ll need it when you shop with the French. ‘Cause they’re not your friends. Yeah. I’ve never been to a country where you are truly on your own when you’re shopping. You walk into a store, nobody helps you. Nothing. You don’t know who works there, who’s doing anything. Literally, it’s like Undercover Employee. Just walking around. [chuckles] It was 20 minutes, nobody helped me. Finally I started picking my own clothes, and I heard an annoyed voice behind me. “Can I help you?” I was like, “Hi. Yes. I need to get clothes, please.” “My luggage was lost.” And then, Detroit, I got roasted more than I’ve ever been roasted in my life. Ever. Ever. Everything I chose came with a scathing review. I was like, “Yeah, could I please, um, get this in a medium?” He was like, “Medium? No, you mean large or extra-large, no?” “Yeah, no, this one is medium for your body?” “I don’t think so, no?” I was like, “I’m sorry, what?” He’s like, “I think you’re a large. I can bring that one for you.” “Medium is too much for the shirt, okay?” [chuckling] I’m like, “What?” Yo, everything, everything. There was a jacket I wanted to buy. “Could I get this?” He’s like, “No, this one for your skin tone is not great.” “No, You have to think about what is complementary for the colors inside the fabric and also inside your face, okay?” “This one is not the best.” I was like, “Yo, I already own something like this.” He’s like, “Ah, and you’re wearing it?” “Well, not anymore.” “No, you can wear it if you want.” “C’est tranquille. Go ahead.” “No, you threatened me now.” You know what? It’s just different. A friend said to me, “Dude, the French are assholes, right?” I was like, “I don’t think that they’re assholes.” “I think they’re just very honest.” All right? It’s hard to tell the difference between the two. ‘Cause one day I was speaking to a French woman and I worked up the courage to ask her, I said, “Hey, um…” “Why are the French… like this?” And she said, “What do you mean?” I said, “When you’re in a store, they seem very mean.” “No, they’re not being mean. They’re just being themselves, no?” “Maybe because you are used to coming in a country where people, they are so afraid that you’re not going to tip them, that they are all on top of you.” “‘Can I help you? Can I help you?'” “But in France, we make sure that everybody is getting a good salary.”\",\n",
              "  \" “A good wage.” “So we are not, you know, so stressed about that.” “In America, it’s like, ‘The customer is king.'” “But in France, you know what we do to kings.” “So, you know…” “It’s not the same here.” The French don’t play that game. You’ve been so much fun tonight, Detroit. Thank you. [audience cheering] Thank you so much. Proved me right. This is why you go to Detroit. For real. It’s an amazing audience. Beautiful, diverse. And the city’s been cool, too. We’ve been seeing a few things here and there. I had a fight with my friend Dave. He directs these specials and he said to me one day, “Yo, what are you doing during the day?” And I was, “Might go eat, do something.” He’s like, “Dude, why don’t we go check out all the museums in Detroit?” I was like, “Maybe like one.” He said, “What do you mean, one?” I was like, “Yeah, not all. What do you mean, all?” He’s like, “Dude, have you been here before?” “You know how many amazing museums they got?” “Yes, but it’s still a museum.” “I’ll do like one, and that’s it.” “I don’t have that much stamina. I can’t do as many as you.” “What do you mean you can’t do as many as me?” “Dude, because you’re white, like, you enjoy doing that.” And I was just joking. I was just teasing him. Just teasing him. He got so offended so quickly, right? [laughs] He’s like, “What did you say?” “Because you’re…” He’s like, “Dude, white people don’t love museums.” “What are you even talking about?” “Like, museums aren’t even in the top five things white people love, okay?” He said it with such confidence. and with such conviction, I was like, “What is the top five?” ‘Cause what a strange… “That’s not even in the top five.” Like, in his bedroom, he has a list on the wall of the top ten things. [laughing] It was amazing. I thought about it. I was like, “No, it is.” “I stick with my decision.” Museums would be. ‘Cause, no, it’s not even a bad thing. White people love museums. A lot of people enjoy museums, but white people love museums. Love museums. There’s not a single place on Earth where white people have settled and not built a museum. It doesn’t matter. White people love museums. You ever seen white people in a museum? Walking around smiling with their hands behind their back? “Yep, that was us.” “That was us, too.” “It’s been a good run.” White people love museums. I wouldn’t put it at number one, but it’d be in the top five. I thought about it. If there were top five things white people love, I’d put museums at number five. At number four, I’d put swimming. All right? ‘Cause white people love swimming. Nothing wrong with that. Have you seen white people swim? You look stunning. Stunning. When white people swim, you do that thing with your hair. You come out of the water, like… [imitates whooshing] Just go perfectly back like a duck. I would love swimming, too. White people love swimming. White people love swimming so much, that they made it that you can win more medals at the Olympics, swimming, than any other discipline. Yeah, that’s how much white people love swimming. I realized this one day. There was an argument going on about who the greatest Olympian of all time is. And the final two was Michael Phelps and Usain Bolt. And then one of the arguments was, “Well, Michael Phelps is better because he has more medals.” And I was like, “Yeah, because he cheated.” “He won them swimming.” I’m not saying Michael Phelps is not great. I’m saying you can’t count the medals in the argument. Because in swimming it’s the only discipline where you win more medals for doing the same thing in a sligh\",\n",
              "  'tly less efficient manner. It makes no sense. Think about it. It’s like, “100-meter freestyle.” [imitates beep] [panting] Done. Gold medal. Yeah. And now this. Another medal. Yeah. And this one? Another medal. But what about this one? Another medal. That’s some bullshit. I don’t care what anyone says. You can’t win more medals. Usain Bolt doesn’t have that luxury. When Usain Bolt runs, it’s the 100-meter and it’s done. “On your marks, set…” Run, run, run, run. Get to the end, win, gold medal. That’s it. He can’t turn around like, “Amazing race. And now I’m going to do it butterfly style.” It’s not a thing. I mean, it should be, but it’s not. White people love swimming, so they made up the rule. I get it. It would have to be, yeah. Of my top five things, I’d go museums at number five, swimming at number four. Number three, being flabbergasted. White people love being flabbergasted. Come on. You know exactly what I’m talking about. Have you ever seen when a white person’s having a bad day, something’s gone wrong, they do that thing with their face, get flabbergasted like… White people love being flabbergasted. You’ll see it in supermarkets all the time. There’s like a long line. All right? But only one cashier is open. [chuckles] Everyone’s standing patiently. There’s always one white person who pops out like… “Why don’t they open the other…” “Are you serious?” “What are they… Are you…” The only thing white people love more is finding another white person to flabbergast with. Have you seen that? Yo, whenever that happens, magic. It is absolute magic. A white person will be flabbergasting. They’ll make eye contact with another white person, and then they’ll flabbergast together. It’s like they Voltron their flabbergasting into a super flabbergast. You see them look over. “You see this?” “I know.” [sighing] That’s one of the keys to flabbergasting. You have to exhale. Let it all out. Life is so hard that the air has to leave your body. You can no longer even breathe. [sighing heavily] That’s why there’s so many tornadoes in the Midwest. It’s just white people flabbergasting… [sighing vigorously] White people love being flabbergasted. Has to be. Has to be top five. That would be my list. Top five things white people love. I’ve got museums at number five. All right, swimming at number four. Being flabbergasted, number three. Number two, being white. It’s a sweet gig. I don’t blame you. And then there’s number one. And look, this is my personal list. I’m not dictating anything. If you don’t agree, make your own, right? It’s a personal preference. But there is one thing, and one thing alone, that white people love more than anything on this planet. “Sweet Caroline.” Let me tell you something, Detroit. There is nothing that brings more joy to the soul of a white person than the sounds of that Neil Diamond song. I don’t care where it is. I’ve been on every continent, in many countries. When that song plays, you see white people’s eyes light up… like sleeper agents who’ve just been activated. It happens every time, without fail. Every single time. It’s not about music, other songs will be playing. They’ll be at a cookout or a baseball game, a company event. All the other songs are in the background. They pay them no heed. But when that song kicks in, it taps into the very DNA of whiteness. I don’t know what it is. But it interrupts everything else. You’ll see white people hanging out. They’ll be like, “Yeah, business, mergers and acquisitions.” “It’s one of those things.” “I know, we should circle back.” “Let’s put a pin in ',\n",
              "  'it.” [blabbering] And that song comes in, and every single time… You think it won’t happen. It always creeps in. It always seems like it won’t happen. But it’s always the same, just like… ♪ Hands, touchin’ hands ♪\\n♪ Reachin’ out, touchin’ me ♪\\n♪ Touchin’ you Pum, pum, pum ♪\\n♪ Sweet Caroline ♪ [audience humming the tune] See, I didn’t tell you to join in. I didn’t say, “All together now.” Or, “On the count of three.” That was just your whiteness coming out. Did you feel that? Huh? That was just you. You were like, “This is it!” “This is our moment!” ♪ Oh, oh, oh ♪ ♪ I’m white, white, white, white ♪ ♪ White, white ♪ Look at you right now. You’re beaming! Look at your face. Look at you. Look at that joy. Ten minutes ago, “I don’t know about this guy.” Now you’re like, “Best comedian ever!” Don’t ever lose that joy. None of you white people. You hold on to it. It is a treasure. It is the most adorable thing in the world. Nothing makes white people happier than that song. Nothing. That song is pure, uncut Caucasian joy. That’s what that song is. White people cannot resist it. Yeah, forget 23andMe. If you want to know how much white you have in you, play that song. The louder you respond, the whiter you are. I just saved you some money. There’s no white person I’ve seen… It is the Marco to your Polo. That’s what that song is. I’ll tell you, if there was ever, like, a giant earthquake, God forbid, and people were trapped beneath the rubble, I’d volunteer to find all the white people. I’ll be like, “You guys find everybody else.” “I got this. I got this!” ♪ “Sweet Caroline” ♪ “I found another one!” “You okay, man?” [coughs to the beat of “Sweet Caroline”] Right now some of you are like, “Trevor, we like that song, but it’s not the most important to us.” Yeah? Then how come you didn’t help me sing the anthem? Detroit, you have been amazing. Thank you so much. I had such a great time with all of you. I appreciate you. Good night.
