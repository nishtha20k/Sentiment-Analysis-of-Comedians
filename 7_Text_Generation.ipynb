They cracked it, pulled him out, reassembled it. Boom. Here we are at The Wiener\\u2019s Circle, bro\\u2026 The best hot dog in Chicago. And they treat me like I\\u2019m from here. Come on in.

My grandfather, who passed away, used to say\\u2026 A waitress would bring him water, and he would say, \\u2018What is that?\\u2019 And she\\u2019d say, \\u2018It\\u2019s water.\\u2019 And he said, \\u2018I\\u2019m thirsty, not dirty, so get me a drink.\\u2019 So cheers to my grandpa. Here we are, Chi Town. We did it. We came a long way. We\\u2019re here. I\\u2019m so happy to be back in this city. I\\u2019m back home. It\\u2019s amazing. I\\u2019m feeling the vibe again. You know what I mean? I took a walk around the lake. I was listening to conversations, two guys arguing, yelling at each other with that thick Chicago accent. You know, that\\u2026 Ah, Chicago. It\\u2019s Chicago. \\u2018A\\u2019 s are ahs. Chi-cah-go. And Ts are Ds. Over dere in Chi-cah-go. You know that? \\u2018A\\u2019s, ahs, T, Ds, everyone\\u2019s racist. It\\u2019s such a good city. What a city. I heard two men fighting. Two men were in an argument, in just a verbal argument, not anything bigger than that, just arguing, and the one guy goes, \\u2018You know what? Why don\\u2019t you suck my dick?\\u2019 And the other guy goes, \\u2018Pfft! You suck my dick.\\u2019 And I was like, \\u2018Hey, suck each other\\u2019s dicks, man.\\u2019 That would\\u2019ve been a fight to see, huh? Comes up like, \\u2018You motherfucker.\\u2019 Finish him. Finish him. We got to stop saying it like that. Guys have to stop saying it like that \\u2019cause girls are gonna start believing it. It has a negative connotation when you say that. You go, \\u2018Suck my dick.\\u2019 We say it negative. Suck my dick. You say it like it\\u2019s a bad thing. It\\u2019s the best thing in the world. It\\u2019s the best thing that\\u2019s ever happened to me. We should say it nice. You should go, \\u2018Hey! \\u2018Suck my dick, please, if you have time. \\u2018If you don\\u2019t, it\\u2019s not a big deal. I would love it a lot.\\u2019 I\\u2019m proud of being from this town. I love this town. I miss it a lot. It\\u2019s where my family is from. My family\\u2019s still here. It\\u2019s great to come home, see my parents. They\\u2019re getting older, which is weird. That\\u2019s a hard thing, to see your parents get older\\u2026 Like, honest older, You know when your parents just say shit that when you were a kid, you were like, \\u2018Oh, you never used to say shit like that when I was a kid.\\u2019 Like, my mom was like, \\u2018Well, I\\u2019m gonna leave the house. What are you gonna do for the weekend?\\u2019 And my dad was watching TV, and he turns, and he goes, \\u2018Eat steak, watch porn.\\u2019 I applaud the honesty out of that guy, really sharp. I appreciate that. Tell her the truth, man. They\\u2019re getting older. You know what I mean? They get older, but I love that about these people. They\\u2019re fantastic. They raised me. I mean, did they raise me correctly? I don\\u2019t know. Maybe not. I grew up here in downtown Chicago for half of my life in Chicago. In the second half, we moved to the western suburbs, right? We moved to the suburbs \\u2019cause my sister was born, and my parents were like, \\u2018I\\u2019 m not gonna fuck up two of them. \\u2018We can\\u2019t do that. One\\u2019s good. We\\u2019ll fuck up one. That\\u2019s okay.\\u2019 We moved to the western suburbs, you know, to try to better the life of all of us, but, like, I still realize sometimes how, like, my mom used to fuck with us subtly. Like, my mom is crazy. She\\u2019s a crazy person in the best way, but she would, like, lay it in real slow. Like, my parents were somewhat religious, right? You know, I mean, Irish Catholic kind of. You know what I mean? Like, somewhat in, you know what I mean? They\\u2019re, like, in the hot tub maybe. But she used to do this thing. She used to make me say, every single night before I went to bed, \\u2018Now I lay me down to sleep.\\u2019 Do you know that? Does anybody know that? I used to have to say this. I used to have to repeat this. I \\u2018d say,\\u2019 Now I lay me down to sleep. \\u2018I pray the Lord my soul to keep, \\u2018and if I die before I wake, I pray the Lord my soul to take.\\u2019 I would say that before bed, which is a really fucked-up thing\\u2026 for a child to say out loud. If I die before I wake up? I\\u2019m six. I\\u2019m gonna die in the middle of the night, and God\\u2019s gonna leave my body, take my soul, but be like, \\u2018Body\\u2019 s good. Leave the body. It\\u2019s fine. Leave it.\\u2019 What\\u2019s going on? Crazy person. I love her. She\\u2019s the best in the world. I had Irish Catholic guilt. I had so much Irish Catholic guilt when I was a kid, I used to flip a coin to determine whether or not I was gonna masturbate that day. You think I\\u2019m kidding? I would take a quarter. I would go, \\u2018Heads, yes, tails, no.\\u2019 I\\u2019d flip it, I\\u2019d get tails, and I\\u2019d go, \\u2018Ah, best two out of three. We got to go again. Let \\u2018s see what happens.\\u2019 He didn\\u2019t beat me, never won. That\\u2019s how heavy my guilt was. Seriously, that\\u2019s how, like, in my head I was about that God-is-watching-you type of stuff. Like, my mother used to let us not lock the doors. She was against it. She was like, \\u2018You don\\u2019 t lock the doors inside of the house. \\u2018If you\\u2019 re locking the doors inside of the house, it means you\\u2019re doing something you shouldn\\u2019t be doing.\\u2019 Yeah, that\\u2019s why we lock the doors. Don\\u2019t come in here. I\\u2019m pulling on my body. Get out of here. Leave me alone, lady. That\\u2019s how I realized the guy that invented locks inside of a house must\\u2019ve been caught masturbating by his wife one too many times. He was sick of it. He was sick of it. He\\u2019s like, \\u2018You know what? That\\u2019s it. I\\u2019m gonna put locks inside the house.\\u2019 She \\u2018s like,\\u2019 Michael, what are you doing? \\u2018We have locks on the outside of the house \\u2018to keep criminals from coming inside. There\\u2019s no criminals inside of this house.\\u2019 Yes, there are, Karen, and they\\u2019re robbing me of my freedom. Let me pull on my body in peace. Leave me alone, Karen. Anyway, I love being from this city, and now I live in Los Angeles, California. I live on the other side of this great country. I like it out there. It\\u2019s okay. It\\u2019s a second home for me. It takes some getting used to. It\\u2019s a little bit difficult, but the big difference is, like, when I come back home, you know, like, all my mom wants to do is talk about, like, the weather. Like, that\\u2019s a big thing. My mom is like, \\u2018How is the weather in California? Is it nice like this?\\u2019 It\\u2019s like, \\u2018Yeah, it\\u2019s better than this. That\\u2019s why I\\u2019m out there. What are you talking about?\\u2019 It\\u2019s always better. It\\u2019s always better. It is. There\\u2019s a lot of stuff that isn\\u2019t better, but the weather\\u2019s always gonna be better, and she loves bringing up the \\u2018feels like\\u2019 meter. You know what that is? The news guy. The news guy\\u2019s like, \\u2018It\\u2019s 62. Feels like 68.\\u2019 That\\u2019s Midwest hope. That\\u2019s hope circulating in your body. It\\u2019s the greatest lie ever told. Who\\u2019s the \\u2018feels like\\u2019 guy? I want that job. If that\\u2019s a job, I want it tonight. I\\u2019ll drop this bullshit gig and go do that tonight. The \\u2018feels like\\u2019 guy\\u2026 Greatest gig ever. Here in the studio, it\\u2019s 62 on the barometer. We\\u2019re gonna go live to Andrew Santino. Andrew, what does it feel like? How\\u2019s it going, news team? Like 67. Right back to you guys. Back to you guys, man. It\\u2019s nice, really nice out. It\\u2019s crazy, man, \\u2019cause the weather here fluctuates so much. Like, when I come back, you\\u2019re never surprised. Like, you\\u2019re never surprised by anything in Chicago, but, like, who I feel bad for when I come back is the homeless people. I always feel bad for homeless here, man. Like, I don\\u2019t feel bad for homeless people in L.A. People can get mad at me for saying that. I don\\u2019t give a shit. They\\u2019re awful human beings, these L.A. homeless people. They\\u2019re terrible. They\\u2019re terrible people. I feel bad for Chicago homeless, right? Because they die in the winter, and they die in the summer. They\\u2019re never not dying. They\\u2019re always dying. There\\u2019s, like, a week when it\\u2019s like, \\u2018We might make it,\\u2019 and that\\u2019s it, and they bucket-drum their way through that week. Soldiers, man. So I feel bad for homeless people in Chicago, from my heart, \\u2019cause this is my home. So, when I come home, I give money. I gave money today to a homeless guy. I\\u2019m not lying. I gave money to a homeless guy \\u2019cause I feel bad for him. I know what he\\u2019s got to go through. I gave that money to that guy, right? And I\\u2019ll always do that, but I also want to look him in the eye and go, \\u2018Hey, start walking south. You have nothing to do tomorrow. What are you doing here? You have something on your calendar? You don \\u2018t have a calendar.\\u2019 You can air-fistfight dragons all over this great country. I\\u2019m sure there\\u2019s half-smoked cigarettes strewn across this great land. I mean, the wind is their therapist. That\\u2019s all over the place. They can move about, man. You know the birds? You know those things? You know those guys? When they leave, follow those guys. Birds are born instinctively knowing, when it gets cold, to be like, \\u2018Oh, let\\u2019 s get the fuck out of here. \\u2018It\\u2019 s cold. Let\\u2019s leave. This is ridiculous. Why are we here? This is ridiculous.\\u2019 But I don\\u2019t feel bad for homeless people in Los Angeles at all\\u2026 I really don\\u2019t. I don\\u2019t. I don\\u2019t feel bad for them. Some people are like, \\u2018Oh, that\\u2019s kind of mean.\\u2019 I don\\u2019t give a shit. I don\\u2019t give a shit, \\u2019cause I live amongst these people, and they\\u2019re rude. They\\u2019re rude. You know why they\\u2019re rude? \\u2018Cause they made it. They\\u2019re at the promised land. It\\u2019s 72 degrees outside. You know what it is inside my place? Seventy-two. Who pays for that? I do. Fuck those guys. They won the lottery. They sleep on the beach. I came out of a restaurant, right? I came out of a restaurant. When I first moved there, I had no money. I had zero money. Came out of a restaurant, had some leftovers, went up to a homeless guy, said, \\u2018Hey, sir, I got some leftovers. Would you like this?\\u2019 Okay? I\\u2019m on a date, in front of a lady. Would you like this, sir? And the homeless guy looks up at me, and he says, \\u2018What\\u2019s in it?\\u2019 And I looked at him, and I said, \\u2018Tomorrow.\\u2019 Another day on this earth. What are you, gluten-free? Eat the food. You\\u2019re cock-blocking me, man. I\\u2019m trying to smash a five. Help me out. What are you doing? Why are you doing this? Times are tough. Who are you? But I like it. It\\u2019s my second home. This is my first home. L.A.\\u2019s my second home, and I do like it. There is things about it that I like. I live now in Los Angeles in a neighborhood called West Hollywood. West Hollywood is a gay neighborhood. It\\u2019s kind of like up here. It\\u2019s like where we are right now, Boystown. I like the gay neighborhood. The gay neighborhood is the best neighborhood. I\\u2019ve ever lived in in my life. It\\u2019s safe. It\\u2019s beautiful. I love it. I love it. You get in where you fit in, and I fit into that neighborhood, okay? I\\u2019m not gay, Dad, but\\u2026 I\\u2019m down to live around gay people. They keep it clean and safe. I\\u2019ve never been attacked once in my neighborhood, and by the way, if I did get attacked, I would love to be attacked. What a beautiful way to walk home. A guy leaps out of a bush. Where are you going? Where are you going? Where? Where? Gives me outfit tips. They can fly, you know. I have a lot of gay friends because of that. They\\u2019re people just like you and me. There\\u2019s nothing different. There\\u2019s nothing different about that neighborhood. It\\u2019s cleaner and safer, and I fucking love it. The only difference is, I got a big beard. I\\u2019ve had big beard. I got to keep a big beard for a while. And that\\u2019s okay. Gay guys love guys with beards. Why? I don\\u2019t know. It\\u2019s a thing. It\\u2019s an underbelly thing. It\\u2019s on the Internet. Look it up. And I often get hit on. I get hit on a lot, okay? I get hit on way more in the gay community than in the straight community, and I\\u2019m okay with that. It\\u2019s a confidence booster, fellas. It feels nice. But I\\u2019ve lived in a gay neighborhood for so long that now I\\u2019m picky about what gay guy hits on me. A gay guy hollers at me, and I\\u2019m like, \\u2018All right, you couldn\\u2019t handle it, dude. \\u2018You couldn\\u2019 t handle it. Too tight, too tight. \\u2018Keep walking, man. Pinch it right off. Get up out of here, man.\\u2019 Couldn\\u2019t have it. That\\u2019s some true shit. You got to be careful of social cues. Social cues mean a lot, right? And guys are stupid. Men are stupid. We\\u2019re stupid people by nature. We\\u2019re just dumb. We don\\u2019t give a shit, by the way, when girls are like, \\u2018Men are dumb.\\u2019 I don\\u2019t care. You think I care you think I\\u2019m dumb? I don\\u2019t give a shit. I know I\\u2019m dumb. It feels really good. Try going out your day without talking about a relationship. That\\u2019s what you guys do all day. It\\u2019s like, \\u2018I heard he was with her, but then she was\\u2019\\u2026 And we just walk around like\\u2026 It\\u2019s great. It\\u2019s fantastic. I don\\u2019t worry about shit. It makes my day so much easier, but guys are idiots, and I\\u2019m proud to be an idiot. But social cues amongst men are interesting because you got to be careful what you do in my neighborhood, right? Like, in my neighborhood, it\\u2019s a little bit different, \\u2019cause when I walk down the street and I see another guy, right, I do this thing. If I see you, and I walk down the street, right, we pass each other, and I go like this, what do you do? If I go like\\u2026 Yeah, you dude me right back, right. You dude me right back. He dudes me. We dude it. Hey, dude it. We dude it. Do we know why we dude? No. Zero clue. We walk around like pigeons all day like, \\u2018Hey, hey.\\u2019 We don\\u2019t give a shit. I do it to black guys to show them that I\\u2019m not a pussy. I go, \\u2018Hey, what\\u2019 s up? We good, we good? \\u2018We\\u2019re good. I\\u2019m good with the black guy. \\u2018In case a fight breaks out, we got a black guy. \\u2018We\\u2019 re good. We got one. We\\u2019re good, we\\u2019re good. We got him.\\u2019 I have no idea why we do that. We share genitalia. There\\u2019s no other reason that we do that to one another. But you can\\u2019t do that in my neighborhood \\u2019cause it means something totally different\\u2026 and it hurts. It hurts a lot. I like living there. I do like it. I really do. Like, I like living in Los Angeles. I like progressive culture, okay? I really do. I like the way that people think about other people as humans instead of a subset, right? This country got all up in arms. Everybody voted to make bathrooms gender-neutral. I don\\u2019t know if you know about that, but there was a big debate going on around this country about should we make bathrooms gender\\u2026 Should we be able to let other people use bathrooms that didn\\u2019t initially have that genitalia, right? People that are transsexual. Should we let them use our bathrooms? Ooh, careful. Who knows what could happen? What could happen? Nothing. They\\u2019re gonna shit in your bathroom that you shit in. You think your bathroom\\u2019s that important, where you let go of all your fluids. You care that much about your fluids that you care who comes after. When I go in there, I \\u2018m like,\\u2019 Aah! \\u2018There better be someone else decent that comes in after me. \\u2018I don\\u2019 t want some transsexual coming in after that. Who knows what they \\u2018ll do?\\u2019 Who do you think you are? It was a big debate, gender-neutral bathrooms. And I\\u2019m all for it. Bathrooms are bathrooms. I don\\u2019t give a shit who uses my bathroom after me. Use it. You got to go, go ahead. Use the bathroom, man. It\\u2019s a good thing. For years, I was sick and tired of going to a bar and seeing girls cut the bathroom line when theirs are too long. They walk to the guys, and they go, \\u2018Hi, our line\\u2019 s too long. \\u2018Do you think me\\u2026 Can we cut? Is this chill if we cut?\\u2019 I know that\\u2019s a stereotypical impression. I don\\u2019t give a shit. That\\u2019s real. \\u2018Can we cut?\\u2019 That\\u2019s real. And every asshole in line is like, \\u2018Yeah, go ahead.\\u2019 Also real, also real, also a real impression of us. You go like that. We go like that. Okay? So guys let them in, and I\\u2019m tired of that shit, \\u2019cause we can\\u2019t use your bathrooms. Guys can\\u2019t use girls\\u2019 bathrooms at bars. You can use ours. Why can\\u2019t we use yours? The only thing I ever hear is, \\u2018Well, you pee on the seat.\\u2019 Do we? I don\\u2019t. I don\\u2019t pee on the seat. If you live with someone that pees on the seat, it\\u2019s \\u2019cause they hate your fucking guts. They\\u2019re sending you a message. Oh, no, you get the groceries, Karen, you fucking bitch. Fucking asshole. He\\u2019s saying something to you. That\\u2019s between you two. What do you think? You think we walk in the bathroom, we just open it up, and let it go, and it\\u2019s, like, wherever it goes, it goes. I know where it goes. I got a laser pointer. I know precisely where it goes. Pff, right there. Pee on the seat. That\\u2019s amazing. It\\u2019s ridiculous. To me, I think the fix has always been remove the stalls from men\\u2019s bathrooms in bars. Remove them. Urinals or just holes in the ground, it doesn\\u2019t really matter. Guys will pee into anything. We don\\u2019t really give a shit. But get the stalls out of men\\u2019s bathrooms in bars because they shouldn\\u2019t be there in the first place, okay? They should never have been there, \\u2019cause a girl can\\u2019t walk in now and use a urinal. Unless you can, ladies, and then I want to see it. If you can tippy-toe pee, I would love to see it. I don\\u2019t know if it\\u2019s this way or that way. I don\\u2019t know which way is better, but if you can do that, I want to check it out. But there shouldn\\u2019t be stalls in men\\u2019s bathrooms in bars in the first place, because who the fuck is pooping at the bar? You\\u2019re gonna poop at the bar? You\\u2019re gonna poop here? Steve, you\\u2019re gonna poop at the bar. The bar that we\\u2019re at, you\\u2019re gonna poop at this bar? You feel okay with that as a person, pooping at the bar? Okay, now I know who you really are. Pooping at the\\u2026 Who are your friends? Who\\u2019s your family? Go home, you animal. What are you, you pig person? Poop at the bar? Are you out of your mind? You\\u2019re gross. You\\u2019re a gross human. You don\\u2019t poop at the bar. You man up if you have to poop. You man up if you have to poop. You finish your drink, pinch it off, and you walk home, so you can poop at the house naked like a grown-up\\u2026 like a full-grown adult. If you\\u2019re pooping at the bar that I\\u2019m at and I see you doing that, I\\u2019m gonna walk in, look under, walk out, and go, \\u2018Hey, there\\u2019 s a guy pooping here \\u2018wearing blue Adidas. Blue Adidas, yeah. He \\u2018s pooping right now.\\u2019 And then leave you with your mistake. Why is everybody looking at my shoes? \\u2018Cause you pooped here, Mike. What\\u2019s wrong with you? Get your life locked up, pig. Go home, you pig. Say that next time you see someone pooping in a bathroom. Walk in and go, \\u2018Go home, you pig. You make me sick.\\u2019 Unbelievable, man, how we prote\\u2026 We protect the bathrooms like they\\u2019re a big deal. Who gives a shit about the bathrooms? Dude, go to the bathroom. We protect bathrooms in this country like it\\u2019s something important. It\\u2019s remarkable to me. Sometimes you go to a restaurant, and you\\u2019re like, \\u2018Hey, can I get the key to the bathroom? It\\u2019s locked.\\u2019 They\\u2019re like, \\u2018Oh, yeah, we got the key. Here you go.\\u2019 It\\u2019s attached to a comically large ladle for no reason. You got a spoon on the goddamn thing. Now you got to take that in there, find a place for it. It\\u2019s gonna be a nightmare. Go ahead. You\\u2019re gonna hate every second of that. Why do we do that? We lock them. You keep the bathroom under lock and key? You realize in every restaurant, every restaurant you can walk right in, go right into the kitchen? There\\u2019s no locks on a kitchen. Just walk in and go, \\u2018Hey, what\\u2019s up, you guys?\\u2019 Dunk your hand in some soup. More salt. Needs more salt. I got to go. I want to use the bathroom. You got the key? No. Get real. It\\u2019s a weird country, man. We live in a weird country. We live in a weird time. I didn\\u2019t want to talk about anything that\\u2019s going on right now, but because I got a lot of time, it\\u2019s the late show, I\\u2019ll do whatever the fuck I want. So let me say this. I\\u2019m proud to be from where I\\u2019m from, okay? I\\u2019m proud to be from Chicago, Illinois. I\\u2019m proud to be from the United States of America. I\\u2019m not trying to get on a patriotic kick. All I want to say is, we got some fucked-up things going on in our country. Times are really crazy. It\\u2019s unfortunate as fuck. It\\u2019s awful. People on both sides are blaming people on both sides, okay? I have cops that are in my family. Every cop is not a bad fucking person, and every person isn\\u2019t a bad person, right? These are the same fucking things. So don\\u2019t point fingers at either side. We need to be better people in general, across the fucking board. That\\u2019s it. That\\u2019s it. Good. I\\u2019m a\\u2026 I\\u2019m a guy who recently, thankfully, found a woman who was dumb enough to stick around. Stupid girl, stupid girl. \\u2018Cause look at this, you know. Like, look at guys. You\\u2019re gross. Why would they even go for us? Why would a woman want to do stuff with you? You\\u2019re gross. You\\u2019re disgusting. Look at a naked woman. Take one look at a naked woman, right? Beautiful, symmetrical, hairless. What a creature. Whatever made it finely crafted it like a Ferrari, you know? Took time with it. And then they got to the guy, and they were like, \\u2018Ah, we ran out of time. \\u2018No, put the genitals on the outside. \\u2018It doesn\\u2019 t matter. \\u2018No one\\u2019 s gonna see. Who cares? \\u2018Hair? Throw some hair on it. Fine, throw some hair on it.\\u2019 It\\u2019s phenomenal. Every day we\\u2019ve fooled you. Like, we should wake up, guys, and just be like, \\u2018Ah, tricked them. \\u2018We tricked them again. We got away with murder.\\u2019 I don\\u2019t know how we ever convinced you to do anything in the first place. Kiss me where I pee? Kiss me where I pee? How? How? How? You know that place that you breathe and eat from? May I stuff my dick in there? Can I clog up your source of life with some flesh? Life, the life hole, can I just\\u2026 Cork it? I want to cork it. I want to cork your life hole with my body. How on earth did you say yes? Cork it? It\\u2019s a remarkable thing, when you think about it. Like, how did we ever even start the sexual chemistry to even get to that level of doing stuff? Here you go. A guy can go to a bar. A single guy goes to a bar trying to pick up chicks. He can go out there and mumble around. I want to put my body in your body. That\\u2019s all he\\u2019s saying. Baseline level, I want to put my body in your body. Can we do that? You sound debonair at the bar. You \\u2018re like,\\u2019 Well, well, I work for an investment firm downtown.\\u2019 But what you\\u2019re really saying is, like, \\u2018I want to put my body in your body. I\\u2019d like to put my body inside of your body.\\u2019 That\\u2019s all it is. You\\u2019re not that cool. You\\u2019re just trying to put some of your body in someone\\u2019s body. You got a gap. I got a wedge. Can we do the thing when I put the thing in the thing? That\\u2019s it. Think about that\\u2026 That\\u2019s a hard thing to do, to go out to a bar and convince a girl I\\u2019m the guy that you want to do things with. Think about how hard it was for us to start that. How did we start that? How did a caveman ever get to that point with a cave woman? How did a caveman say that when there was no language, no communication skills? First of all, when you were a caveman, you just stood around with your buddies, mumbling. That\\u2019s it. There\\u2019s really nothing going on, just a lot of\\u2026 Then one of you, out of nowhere, would just get an erection. Explain that to the crew. All your buddies are mad. Hey! They don\\u2019t like it pointing at them. You got to be a nonverbal dick salesman, going up to women like\\u2026 What are you selling? She doesn\\u2019t know. You can\\u2019t say it. Who said yes? The slowest girl in the pack\\u2026 on a bad leg she was lugging around. Okay, okay. Okay. How did that happen? The guy that convinced a girl to do that for the first time invented fire and the wheel that afternoon. It was like\\u2026 Everything clicked. I got it. Everything made sense. I would\\u2019ve loved to see the first caveman to discover pulling out. That would\\u2019ve been amazing. Right? The first guy that\\u2019s like\\u2026 That\\u2019s how all that shit on the wall got started. They were like\\u2026 What, do you think that was ink? That was no ink. It\\u2019s jizz symbols. How great is that fucking thing? My buddy\\u2019s an artist, and I was like, \\u2018I want a fucking papa bear \\u2018with a cubby bear with a Blackhawks headdress, \\u2018and I want him wearing Jordans for the Bulls \\u2018and white socks, and I want him eating deep dish and drinking a beer.\\u2019 And my buddy smoked enough pot as I did, and he came up with this. So it was fucking pretty amazing. The Chicago flag, yeah. Cool. It\\u2019s cool. We got a lot of pride in this town, so we should. You know what I mean? You can\\u2019t fuck with us. Come fuck with us. Where\\u2019s my crane camera? Come fuck with us, rest of the United States. Where the fuck are you guys at? Come to Chicago. Rip your fucking throats out. I\\u2019m gonna get murdered on the road in Cincinnati in, like, three months. Shit. No, I got a lady. I got a lady this year. I got locked up. I got married this year, which was great. It was a great thing. Don\\u2019t clap for that. Please don\\u2019t clap for that shit \\u2019cause it eggs her on, and I don\\u2019t need that. No, I got married, and it was great. It was very fun. We had a good time. Yeah, it was fun. Thanks a lot. Cool. It was cool, it was cool. She came up to me at the jump, and she was like, she \\u2018s like,\\u2019 What do you think about doing, like, bachelor, bachelorette parties, like, all that stuff?\\u2019 We didn\\u2019t talk about, like, really any of that stuff. We really kind of didn\\u2019t really get into the nitty-gritty, and I was like, \\u2018Well, whatever you want to do.\\u2019 She was like, \\u2018Do you want to have a bachelor party?\\u2019 And I was like, \\u2018I don\\u2019 t know. \\u2018Like, I do stand-up for a living, \\u2018so, like, it\\u2019 s just always kind of a fucking bachelor party. My life is kind of a bachelor party.\\u2019 I was like, \\u2018No, I\\u2019m good.\\u2019 You know what I mean? Like, I just took my best friend for his bachelor party, and I was like, \\u2018That\\u2019s good enough for me.\\u2019 I was like, \\u2018You can do a bachelorette party. Don \\u2018t feel like you can\\u2019t.\\u2019 She was like, \\u2018Are you cool with it?\\u2019 I was like, \\u2018I promise. I\\u2019m totally cool with it. Whatever you want to do, you \\u2018re good. Do it.\\u2019 She was like, \\u2018Okay, trust me. It \\u2018ll be classy.\\u2019 That\\u2019s some dumb shit. Girls are like, \\u2018It\\u2019 s gonna be classy. \\u2018The bachelorette party\\u2026 It\\u2019s gonna be cla\\u2026 I promise. We won\\u2019t be as crazy as you think we\\u2019re gonna be.\\u2019 She was like, \\u2018We\\u2019 re going to Northern California \\u2018to a vineyard. We \\u2018re gonna do wine tasting.\\u2019 So in girls\\u2019 brains, they think that we think that that\\u2019s nice and sweet, but I know the truth. I know they\\u2019re not wine tasting. I know they\\u2019re blacking out on wine. I know they\\u2019re getting purple toothed out, Charlie Chaplain-ing around town like\\u2026 I know. I know what you\\u2019re doing, looking like Grimace. I know. I know. Lie to me, you drunks\\u2026 trying to pretend like\\u2026 We pretend like wine is so sophisticated. It\\u2019s still booze. Stinky-foot grapes, that\\u2019s all it is. Go on a vineyard tour with her girlfriends. See, \\u2019cause here\\u2019s the thing about bachelorette parties. I\\u2019m sure every girl in this room is a wonderful human being. I\\u2019m sure you\\u2019re all stand-up citizens until you get in a bachelorette party, and then you\\u2019re a piece of shit. Then you\\u2019re a piece of shit. Then you storm around town like, \\u2018Look at us, penises everywhere. \\u2018Penises on our body. \\u2018Penis necklace. These are dick-laces. \\u2018These are dick necklaces. This is a dick hat. \\u2018These are dick glasses. They\\u2019re dick shoes. \\u2018Look at it. It comes. This one comes. \\u2018It comes out of that shoe. When I go like that, it comes.\\u2019 What\\u2019s wrong with you? Who are your parents? Shame on you, these women who walk around town doing that shit. It\\u2019s unbelievable\\u2026 Bachelorette parties that take over every bar they go to, screaming. These bitches work in HR during the day, but at night\\u2026 they\\u2019re just like, \\u2018Penis, penis, penis. Penis, penis, penis, penis.\\u2019 Who are your parents? Shame on you. You realize some little kid in China has to make those penis molds? Some little kid in China is pressing penises, penis sunglasses, so you can go out like, \\u2018Cocks, cocks on my head.\\u2019 You psycho. That\\u2019s where guys beat you. That\\u2019s, like, the one spot we beat you. We may be dumber than you, but we beat you there. We beat you by a landslide, because I have never been to a bachelor party where they\\u2019re like, \\u2018Santino, you ready to go? Put on your pussy costume. Let \\u2018s go.\\u2019 I put one on like\\u2026 \\u2018Come on, let\\u2019 s go. \\u2018Get mine wet. Steve, get mine wet. \\u2018Get it wet. Get the clit wet. \\u2018Go. Get it wet. This is what we want.\\u2019 \\u2018Vaginer.\\u2019 We beat you. So we went and got married out of the country. We went to Costa Rica. We went down to Costa Rica. It was great. Central America, beautiful place. Costa Rica is amazing. We loved it. It was fantastic. I didn\\u2019t know that racism is everywhere. I had no idea, but it is, but it really fucking is. Here we are in our hotel, two men are in a fight with one man, two guys on one, two on one, working this dude, and I look out the window, and I\\u2019m like, \\u2018Oh, my God, what happened?\\u2019 To the local guy. And the local guy, who we know, who we\\u2019re buddies with, is like, \\u2018Oh, yeah, the fight?\\u2019 And I was like, \\u2018Yeah, what happened?\\u2019 I\\u2019m ready for the story. And he \\u2018s like,\\u2019 Okay, you see this guy on the ground? \\u2018You see him on the ground, \\u2018this guy who they kick in the face? \\u2018You see him? \\u2018You know, this guy on the ground they kick in the teeth. You see him?\\u2019 I was like, \\u2018Yeah, yeah, definitely. Yeah, what is that?\\u2019 And he goes, \\u2018Oh, yeah, this guy, this guy on the ground, he \\u2018s from Panama.\\u2019 What? \\u2018He\\u2019 s from Panama. Panama, the country. Panama.\\u2019 That\\u2019s it? That was as deep as the well got dug. \\u2018He\\u2019s from Panama.\\u2019 That\\u2019s it. I was like, \\u2018But how did the fight\\u2026 Like, how did you\\u2026 How did the fight happen?\\u2019 He goes, \\u2018Oh, s\\u00ed, s\\u00ed, s\\u00ed, s\\u00ed, s\\u00ed, s\\u00ed. \\u2018Okay, so this guy on the ground, \\u2018he cut off this guy in traffic, \\u2018and he says to him, \\u2018Hey, what the fuck?\\u2019 \\u2018And this guy, he says, \\u2018Hey, man, fuck you.\\u2019 \\u2018So this guy, he gets out of his car, \\u2018and he says, \\u2018Mm-mm, fuck you.\\u2019 \\u2018So then they yell at each other. \\u2018So this guy say fuck you. \\u2018This guy, fuck you. This guy, fuck\\u2026 So both of these guys are fucking you right now.\\u2019 I was like, \\u2018No one\\u2019 s fucking me. What are you talking about?\\u2019 \\u2018And then his friend, he hear him from across the street, \\u2018and his friend, he says, \\u2018Hey, what happened?\\u2019 \\u2018He says, \\u2018He said, fuck you.\\u2019 \\u2018He says,\\u2019 Ah, fuck you.\\u2019 \\u2018He says, \\u2018Fuck you.\\u2019 He says. \\u2018Fuck you.\\u2019 He fuck\\u2026 these guys over here are fucking you.\\u2019 \\u2018And the one guy, he says to him\\u2026 \\u2018Before he fight with him, he says, \\u201dHey, motherfucker, where are you from?\\u2019 \\u2018And this guy, he says, \\u2018Panama.\\u2019 \\u2018And, uh\\u2026 That \\u2018s it for him.\\u2019 Other than that, it was a beautiful country, man. It was gorgeous, man. We did so much white-people shit. It was unbelievable. You know what white-people shit is. Everybody in here knows it, right? It\\u2019s, like\\u2026 We went zip-lining. It\\u2019s, like, white-water rafting, all that white-people\\u2026 White-water rafting is white-people shit. It\\u2019s called white-water rafting. It\\u2019s ours. That\\u2019s some white-people shit. You\\u2019ll never, ever see a black guy white-water rafting, skydiving, drinking coffee. That\\u2019s just not what they do. It\\u2019s not what they do. Skydiving, all that shit. Black guy, do you go skydiving? Never in your fucking life, man. No way. Never in your life. Rock climbing? No way. White-water rafting? No. None of the above. Do you even like coffee? I do like coffee. Oh, come on, man. What did he say? I like it black. You like it black. I get that. I get that. You can have that. Take it black. Take it black. So he knows what I\\u2019m talking about. He knows. I went to college with\\u2026 One of my closest friends in college was this dude we lived with, and he would always make fun of me. He \\u2018s like,\\u2019 You\\u2019re doing some white-people shit, Red. You on some white-people shit right now.\\u2019 I was like, \\u2018I\\u2019m taking out the trash.\\u2019 He\\u2019s like\\u2026 \\u2018That\\u2019s the type of shit I\\u2019m talking about, motherfucker. \\u2018Just throw that shit outside, bitch. \\u2018White-people shit! \\u2018What you doing, dishes, motherfucker? You white-ass motherfucker.\\u2019 What you doing, laundry, you Charmin-ass motherfucker? You Charmin\\u2019\\u2026 I did so much white-people shit in Costa Rica. It was bananas. I loved it, though. I love being a tourist. Like, that\\u2019s the fucked-up thing about Americans. We don\\u2019t want to be tourists. Why not? Why are we so afraid of being tourists? I\\u2019ll do that zip-line dork-ass shit. Give me the helmet. I love that. How much is the picture? $1,000? I don\\u2019t give a shit. I\\u2019ll pay for that, plan for it. Come on, man. Give me that dork tourist shit. We\\u2019re so afraid as Americans to be tourists. Yet for some reason, tourists come here. They\\u2019re not afraid to be tourists. You can go to Michigan Avenue right now. There\\u2019s a cute little Italian couple that\\u2019s like, \\u2018Mi scusi, mi scusi, mi scusi. The water tower, the water tower.\\u2019 And you \\u2018re like,\\u2019 Ah, come here. Let me lie to you. Come here, come here, come here.\\u2019 Let them be tourists, man. Be a tourist. Be a tourist. All I\\u2019m saying is, stop being such a liar. Be who you really are. You\\u2019re out of the country. Be out of the country, man. There\\u2019s nothing wrong with that, you know. Here\\u2019s why. Every time I\\u2019ve ever been to a Spanish-speaking country, there\\u2019s always one guy in the crew, one dude who\\u2019s like, \\u2018Hey, I got us. I can take us around. \\u2018I speak a little bit of Mexican. \\u2018We\\u2019 re gonna be good. We \\u2018ll be good.\\u2019 You speak Mexican, Brad? I speak Mexican, dog. I got us. Don\\u2019t sweat it, man. I took 101 in high school. We\\u2019re gonna be straight. And you\\u2019re like, \\u2018All right, man. I can\\u2019t wait.\\u2019 You walk into a restaurant. I say the truth. I walk in, I go, \\u2018Hello, American, americano, \\u2018American, ready to be ripped off. Look at me.\\u2019 \\u2018Cause I don\\u2019t give a shit. How much is that Coke? Seven? Thought it was ten. You can\\u2019t fuck me. You can\\u2019t fuck me. I planned for that. You cannot fuck me. But he walks in. Brad walks in, talking Mexican like, \\u2018Hola, seniors. Hola, seniors.\\u2019 He thinks he\\u2019s the shit. Brad walks in heavy, and the staff looks at him like, \\u2018Okay, okay, okay, okay. \\u00bfHabla espa\\u00f1ol, se\\u00f1or? \\u00bfHabla espa\\u00f1ol? \\u00bfHabla espa\\u00f1ol?\\u2019 S\\u00ed, s\\u00ed, sen-yours. S\\u00ed, s\\u00ed, sen-yours. Ha-blah a-spaniel. Ha-blah a-spaniel. Ha-blah a-spaniel. And they \\u2018re all like,\\u2019 Okay. \\u2018Hmm. Good, good, good. That\\u2019s good, good. That\\u2019s good.\\u2019 And they just machine-gun Spanish at his fucking head until you see him go, \\u2018Oh, fuck. \\u2018There\\u2019s no bibliotecain there. Where\\u2019s the ban-yo? I don\\u2019t know any of those words.\\u2019 Brad looks like an asshole. Meanwhile, I\\u2019m enjoying my plate of rice and \\u2018polo,\\u2019 having a great time\\u2026 enjoying my life. I came back from Costa Rica. It was fantastic, and then we got into that, like, all the marriage discussion shit. She was like, \\u2018What do you want to do about the last name?\\u2019 I was like, \\u2018I don\\u2019 t know. I mean, I don\\u2019t really care. I don\\u2019t think I really care.\\u2019 I was like, \\u2018I mean, what do you want to do?\\u2019 She\\u2019s like, \\u2018Well, do you want me to take your last name?\\u2019 And there\\u2019s a part of you that\\u2019s like, \\u2018No, man, it\\u2019s cool.\\u2019 Then there\\u2019s a part of you that\\u2019s like, \\u2018Yeah, you got to take the last name.\\u2019 It\\u2019s some male-ego bullshit, but that\\u2019s the truth of the situation. Like, it doesn\\u2019t really mean much. Like, what are last names anyway? I don\\u2019t really know. We don\\u2019t really know, you know. Last names\\u2026 you used to give to somebody \\u2019cause it represented land, right? You had some land. You get some land to give. Like, \\u2018This will all be yours one day.\\u2019 That doesn\\u2019t mean shit nowadays. I can\\u2019t be like, \\u2018Son, this condominium will be yours when I die.\\u2019 Who gives a shit, right? There\\u2019s not much to it. You know, it really doesn\\u2019t mean much. But it\\u2019s strange when I think about, like, white people\\u2019s last names, like, where our last names came from. A lot of times, it used to be your occupation, right? Like, I meet a guy\\u2026 Kevin Blacksmith. His great-great-great-great- grandfather was a blacksmith. Dave Shoemaker, his great-great-great-great- grandfather was a shoemaker. But it\\u2019s weird when you meet a white guy named Eric Lynch\\u2026 \\u2018Cause you\\u2019re like, \\u2018Your great-great-great-great- grandfather was a bad person.\\u2019 Switch it up, dog. But last names are kind of bullshit. You know know what I mean? They mean whatever they want and whatever you want them to mean, and so she said, \\u2018What do you want to do?\\u2019 I said, \\u2018How about we just go with whosever last name is cooler?\\u2019 Right, whosever\\u2019s is cooler. She was like, \\u2018Cooler?\\u2019 I was like, \\u2018Yeah,\\u2019 \\u2019cause in my head, I knew it was already game over. I was like, \\u2018Jordan, buckets.\\u2019 I knew it was over. I knew it was over. She wasn\\u2019t fucking with Santino. What a cool-ass name, Santino. Three syllables\\u2026 San, unh, ti, got you, oh. That\\u2019s what\\u2019s up. I had it. It was in the bag, man. It was in the bag. It was game over. Jordan. It was game over, but then she was like, \\u2018Oh, you think your last name is that much cooler?\\u2019 I said, \\u2018Yeah.\\u2019 Her last name was Eichelberger. You want me to say it again? Eichelberger. And she\\u2019s like, \\u2018What\\u2019s wrong with that?\\u2019 I was like, \\u2018What\\u2019 s right with that shit? What are you talking about, lady?\\u2019 She\\u2019s like, \\u2018It\\u2019s not that big of a deal.\\u2019 I said, \\u2018Well, it\\u2019s like part of the Third Reich.\\u2019 I\\u2019ll have to walk into restaurants, like\\u2026 \\u2018We\\u2019 re here for the Eichelberger party, \\u2018the party of two. \\u2018There is two of us at the party. \\u2018We would like the table in the back of the room. \\u2018In the back of the room, \\u2018behind the air-conditioning, please. Thank you.\\u2019 Anyway, she\\u2019s a Santino now. Yeah. We got into a thing, \\u2019cause I was\\u2026 I feel like I\\u2019m watching too much porn lately, if I\\u2019m just being real with you guys. We\\u2019re getting real. It\\u2019s a late-night show. I was watching too much porn. Porn is bad. It\\u2019s a bad thing. It\\u2019s really addictive. It is. It truly is. I think it\\u2019s not my fault, though. I think it\\u2019s access\\u2026 access, too much access. In your pockets, there\\u2019s a phone, right? In there is all the porno\\u2026 All of it\\u2026 all of it that we make. All of it that we make, you guys. If I had three seconds inside of a time machine, I would \\u2018zorb\\u2019 myself to when I was 14, for three seconds, and just go\\u2026 \\u2018In the future, all the porno\\u2019s in your pocket,\\u2019. And get out\\u2026 and blow my mind. Just\\u2026 semen everywhere. Oh, my God. I\\u2019m waiting for this JPEG to load. Come on, man. That\\u2019s crazy. That is crazy to think about. It really is too much access. Like, I can\\u2019t walk past a laptop without being like\\u2026 \\u2018Ah, this is Best Buy. I got to go.\\u2019 The Blue Shirts, they don\\u2019t like that. You know what I mean? They get weird. We\\u2019ve seen so much of it. The problem is\\u2026 With porn is, it\\u2019s got this stigma where we think we can emulate that stuff. Like, you think you\\u2019re like them. You\\u2019re not like them. Those are pros, man. Those are pros. I got envy. I have envy, envy. The way that these men throw a rope is remarkable. They just\\u2026 It takes off. It\\u2019s got loft. Are you kidding me? I\\u2019m lucky if mine comes out. It\\u2019s like a pensive army. It gets to the surface, and it \\u2018s like,\\u2019 No, no. Go back, go back.\\u2019 And when it does come out, it\\u2019s late for the party. It has nonalcoholic beer. It\\u2019s like, \\u2018Sorry. We\\u2019re here.\\u2019 My wife\\u2026 one night she was like, \\u2018Oh, come on my tits.\\u2019 I was like, \\u2018Oh, I\\u2019ll never make it up there.\\u2019 It\\u2019s so far. It\\u2019s too far. Maybe your belly button, max\\u2026 if I really put in the work. I\\u2019ll tell you what I\\u2019ve been watching a lot of. I\\u2019ve been watching a lot of black porn, lots of black porn. Blackblack. Too. Like, chocolate, chocolate, chocolate, chocolate. Deep chocolate, 99% cacao chocolate. Sexy. No milk. Get out of here, milk chocolate. No time for you. Chocolate, chocolate. I love watching black porn, love watch\\u2026 For one fundamental reason. The guys get to wear shoes\\u2026 on their feet. Men wear shoes on their feet. If you know anything about how shoes and pants work, anything at all, you know that these men took off their shoes, took off their pants and underwear, and then put back on their shoes. Come on. You did it again, black people. Numero uno. I got the envy, man. It\\u2019s a bad thing. It really is. It\\u2019s a bad thing. We need to clean up our minds, clean up our life. You know what I mean? Get clean, clean living. Eat a smoothie, take a walk. It\\u2019s difficult, man. It\\u2019s difficult to do. People always\\u2026 like, listen, I try to work out. I\\u2019m trying to be in shape. I\\u2019m trying to do all that stuff. It\\u2019s a hard thing to do. You know, fast food, going to get fast food always reminds me of what it was like when I was single, going to a one-night stand. It was like the same thing, like the exact same feeling. You\\u2019ll be looking on Google Maps to try to find out if that fast-food joint\\u2019s open, right? You\\u2019re like, \\u2018You up, McDonald\\u2019s? You up?\\u2019 You send a late-night text, like, \\u2018What\\u2019 s up, girl? \\u2018You up? What\\u2019s up, McDonald\\u2019s? \\u2018You up? What\\u2019s up, Mac D\\u2019s? Is you up, playboy? Give me them nuggets.\\u2019 She\\u2019s like, \\u2018Uh-huh.\\u2019 McDonald\\u2019s is like, \\u2018You know it.\\u2019 You cruise over there, and on the way, you\\u2019re like, \\u2018Ooh, it\\u2019 s gonna be good. \\u2018I know what I get at this location. \\u2018This is my favorite spot to go to at this time of night. That number two is my spot right now.\\u2019 That\\u2019s a butt joke. You get over there, and you eat that. You devour that McDiesel\\u2019s. Just like that, you\\u2019re like\\u2026 Devour it. And when you\\u2019re done, you get in the car and cruise home\\u2026 Same feeling. Cruising home, and you\\u2019re like\\u2026 \\u2018I\\u2019m a bad person, man.\\u2019 Sad. I had to cut that out. I had to cut it out, man. I\\u2019m trying to stay healthy. I\\u2019m trying to fit into my own skin. That\\u2019s really what it is. You know, I\\u2019m trying to feel good about myself. It\\u2019s a confidence thing about people. You want to feel confident and cocky, but, like, not too much. Like, I had my ego tested. I got into a car accident. A man hit me. A man hit me. I was at a red light. A man hit me, okay? Red light, skrrr, man, bmm-bmm-bmm, hit me, and I got out of my car. He got out of his car, and I went to say something. Before I could say anything, he goes, \\u2018Hey, what the fuck?\\u2019 And I said\\u2026 \\u2018That\\u2019 s my line. \\u2018I say that. That\\u2019s me. \\u2018I\\u2019m doing\\u2026 That\\u2019s what I do. You say, \\u2018I\\u2019m sorry,\\u2019 I feel like.\\u2019 He was a big-ass dude. He was big, jacked up, and he had tattoos up to his face? Question mark. You good, bro? On your face? You cashed out? You got cancer? What\\u2019s up? On your face? I feel like that\\u2019s some, like, \\u2018I don\\u2019t give a\\u2026 \\u2018Whatever, bro. Go ahead. It\\u2019s done. \\u2018I don\\u2019 t give a shit. \\u2018I\\u2019 ve been collecting Marlboro miles for years. I \\u2018ll cash out.\\u2019 On your face? So I had no way to win this war. This dude was in my face. I had no\\u2026 I was backed up. I was like, \\u2018Whatever, man.\\u2019 And in that moment, I was like, \\u2018I can\\u2019 t win this argument with this dude. I can \\u2018t beat him physically.\\u2019 But I was like, \\u2018If I had a superpower right now, \\u2018you know, it wouldn\\u2019 t be to, like, fly or be invisible. I would love to be able to throw acne on somebody.\\u2019 Right? He\\u2019s all, \\u2018Fuck you.\\u2019 I\\u2019m like, \\u2018Fuck me? Fuck you, man.\\u2019 No! Hit him all over the body, shoulder, bacne. Hit him with the bacne. Hit him with the kn-acne, that knee acne. Light him up, light him up. Scar him physically and emotionally, send him home like that for a couple of weeks, depending on the topical cream. Let it sit. Let it sit. If you\\u2019re not laughing at that, you didn\\u2019t have acne when you were a kid. I had really bad acne when I was a kid, man. It was so bad. It was so bad. Like, acne is, like, the sole reason I questioned God. I\\u2019m like, \\u2018What up, dude? What\\u2019s the deal? \\u2018Where are you at on this one, player? This is ridiculous.\\u2019 Here you are, 13, 14 years old. You\\u2019re the ugliest version of yourself. Look at photos of you at 14. TBT them on Instagram, and you\\u2019re like, \\u2018Ooh, tough-looking kid.\\u2019 You\\u2019re ugly, bro. You are ugly at 14. Teenagers are so gross to look at, hard to see. They\\u2019re hard to see, bro. They\\u2019re skinny. Their voices are crackling. They\\u2019re wobbling all over like little skinny baby giraffes, just hungry and horny like\\u2026 Nasty-looking crea\\u2026 They look like Tim Burton cartoons. They\\u2019re barely alive. You are nasty as a child. And you\\u2019re telling me at this vulnerable point in your life, God is gonna be like, \\u2018You know what? \\u2018I\\u2019 m gonna put some red pus bumps on his face. Pus bump his face up.\\u2019 I didn\\u2019t get it. I didn\\u2019t understand it. I had it so bad. I had to go on Accutane. You used to have to sign a form that said. \\u2018I can die from this medication.\\u2019 What\\u2019s up, guys? What are we saying? I can die from this medi\\u2026 I can die from this medication. And I was underage, so I had a legal guardian. So my mother had to sign it. I was 16. I\\u2019ll never forget. They slipped the sheet to my mother, and she looked at it, and then she looked at me. Yeah. Yeah, this is\\u2026 it\\u2019s\\u2026 it\\u2019s better than your face. It doesn\\u2019t really matter. You\\u2019re an ugly kid. You\\u2019re ugly. It\\u2019s\\u2026 it\\u2019s for you. I had it so bad. I had acne so bad when I was young. When I was in high school, I played basketball for a couple years at my high school until I found out about drugs, and I was like, \\u2018See you later, basketball.\\u2019 Ah, true story. But I played basketball for a little while. When I played basketball, I made the JV team pretty early on, and we played in a summer league, okay? In the summer league, you had to play all the other schools that you were going to play in that regular season, and I\\u2019ll never forget. We went out to West Aurora to go play these guys, and they were supposed to beat us. They were, like, a really good school, right? They were really good. They were an all-black school. We were a some-black school. They were gonna beat us. Bottom line, they were gonna win. And we went out there, and we beat the shit out of these guys. I had the game of my life. I dropped four points. I was on fire. If you know anything about high-school basketball, four points is like, whoa. What are you, MVP? Final score, 12-2. It was a blowout. I mean, we went out there. I had a great game. I was on cloud nine. I felt like a king. Then I left, and I went out to the hallway to go get a drink of water. I\\u2019m getting a drink of water, bending down by the water fountain to have a drink of water. A little black kid, like, eight years old walks in the hallway. Comes up to me and goes, \\u2018Hey, yo, white boy. White boy.\\u2019 I go, \\u2018What\\u2019s up?\\u2019 You\\u2019re pretty good, man. Oh, thanks, man. He goes, \\u2018For a white boy.\\u2019 And I was still like, \\u2018Thank you. I appreciate that.\\u2019 I\\u2019ll take it. Then he goes, \\u2018All right, man.\\u2019 I go, \\u2018All right, man.\\u2019 He walks away. Felt good. Go down to get some more water. He gets to the doorway. He stops\\u2026 real Forest Whitaker-style. He turns around and goes, \\u2018Hey, yo, white boy.\\u2019 I say, \\u2018What\\u2019s up, man? What up?\\u2019 He goes, \\u2018What the fuck is all over your face?\\u2019 That still hurts today. I\\u2019m in my 30s. That cut went all the way to the bone. You know what I mean? Then I walked up to him slowly, and I said, \\u2018Well, this is what happens when your dad sticks around.\\u2019 No, I didn\\u2019t say that. That\\u2019s a joke, man. No, I called him the N word. Then I got out of there as fast as I could. No, stop it. I cried on the bus, man. I cried on the bus. Got to have a sense of humor, man. But I always loved black people. I always did. I really did. I still do. I still do love black people, man. I think they\\u2019re fantastic human beings. Black people always accepted me. Black people really did. White people never liked me. White people don\\u2019t like redheads for some reason. There\\u2019s this thing. White people see redheads, and they\\u2019re like, \\u2018What do we do with it?\\u2019 They don\\u2019t like us. They don\\u2019t trust us. They make a day to kick us. Call us names\\u2026 \\u2018You fire crotch, you ginger.\\u2019 They ask us stupid questions, like does the carpet match the drapes? A black guy\\u2019s never said that to me. White guys\\u2026 \\u2018The carpet match the drapes, bud?\\u2019 And I\\u2019m always like, \\u2018Are you a grown-up asking \\u2018about my penis hair? \\u2018Is that the level that you\\u2019re on? \\u2018You\\u2019 re worried about my penis hair, dude. \\u2018If you must know, it\\u2019s hardwood floors. There \\u2018s no carpet there, bro.\\u2019 I clean it up. Go get you a little buzzer from Target and clean that shit up. You get under there. It\\u2019s like\\u2026 It\\u2019s working overtime under there. That\\u2019s the no-fly zone, no-fly zone. It might die under there, like\\u2026 I can\\u2019t, I can\\u2019t. White people never liked me. They never did. They always made fun of me. That\\u2019s a reality check. Now people are like, \\u2018Huh? What are you talking about?\\u2019 White people always made fun of redheads. Redheads are this outcast. We\\u2019re this weird minority for some reason, but black people always liked me. They really did. They took to me. Like, black people like white people with a deficiency. I\\u2019m like a dog with one bad leg. You know, white people don\\u2019t adopt that dog, but black people are like, \\u2018No, no, no. \\u2018He good, he good, he good. \\u2018He gonna be fine. Come here, Tripod. \\u2018He gonna be fine. Tripod. \\u2018Come here, Tripod. It gonna work out.\\u2019 That\\u2019s just the truth. It just made me feel normal when I was a kid. So I loved hip-hop culture. I loved everything all my black friends liked, so much so that in the \\u201990s, people used to say this word. People used to call me a \\u2018wigger.\\u2019 Do you remember that word? Don\\u2019t get uncomfortable. You all said it. You all said it. I don\\u2019t know why we got rid of it. It was hilarious. You should\\u2019ve stuck around for a while. People used to call me a \\u2018wigger.\\u2019 People used to say \\u2018wigger\\u2019 to me \\u2019cause they thought it would hurt my feelings. They thought, like, that was a way to get my goat. You know what I mean? And I\\u2019ll never forget. I was on a basketball court the first time I heard it, and we had won this basketball game, and this dude from the losing team says\\u2026 \\u2018Whatever, bro. That dude ain\\u2019t nothing but a wigger.\\u2019 And all my black friends heard it, and they were disappointed. They heard him say that, and they were like\\u2026 That\\u2019s how they sound, like a train. They were like\\u2026 When black guys are bummed out, it sounds like a train, just\\u2026 Next stop, Sedgwick. But they were bummed out \\u2019cause that was an attack, you know. They didn\\u2019t like that, but when I heard it, I heard it different, \\u2019cause they were like, \\u2018That white dude ain\\u2019t nothing but a wigger.\\u2019 And I heard it, and I was like, \\u2018Oh\\u2026 so close.\\u2019 How do I get that N? How do I get that N? These are Karl Kani jeans. This is a Perry Ellis shirt. Give it to me. I bought Timberland boots. Say it if you\\u2019re gonna say it, you racist motherfuckers. Say it. How do I get that, man? It was just me being real. That\\u2019s all that was. I wanted to be a black guy. I thought I was black. I thought I was a black guy. Even to this day, I still have a lot of black friends, and I got to tell you\\u2026 Every time I talk to my black guy friends, I\\u2019m always like, \\u2018Hey, man, don\\u2019t date white girls.\\u2019 Don\\u2019t date white girls. Not \\u2019cause I\\u2019m racist. I\\u2019m clearly not racist. I have black friends. I\\u2019m not a racist. I tell my black guy friends to not date white girls \\u2019cause I genuinely care about the future of sports. That\\u2019s it. We don\\u2019t need any placekickers and long snappers. We want dunk contests, right? How do you get a Heisman? You know what I mean? Not from Jerome and Cassie. Jerome and Jaquanda\\u2026 That\\u2019s how we\\u2019re gonna make a Heisman, two beautiful chocolate people making love under a beautiful chocolate rain shower while he\\u2019s got shoes on. We know the formula. We know the formula. Drake is the number-one dude in hip-hop. His name is Aubrey. Yeah! We let him get away with that. Drake\\u2019s name is Aubrey, and nobody said shit about it. Aubrey, number one in hip-hop. What\\u2019s his name, Aubrey? Got it. Okay, cool. We\\u2019re good. He had beef with Meek Mill. It was a big beef. You\\u2019re it. Tag, you\\u2019re it. You\\u2019re it. Tag. Remember real beef? You remember when hip-hop was, like, real beef? People hated each other. Tupac and Biggie hated each other so much, and they were best friends at one point. They had real beef so deep that Tupac started a song called \\u2018Hit \\u2018Em Up\\u2019\\u2026 Before he started the lyrics, he goes, \\u2018So I fucked your bitch, you fat motherfucker.\\u2019 That\\u2019s what he said. You\\u2019re fat. Fucked your girlfriend. Okay, let\\u2019s go. Here we go. That\\u2019s crazy. That\\u2019s how much he hated that guy. That\\u2019s real beef. I feel like hip-hop has, like, dissipated, you know. It\\u2019s just, like, gone by the wayside, and I blame one person for the death of hip-hop. His name is Macklemore. That dude is the worst. That dude is the worst. Macklemore is at fault for all this shit going south. Macklemore is not hip-hop. You can like him, but he\\u2019s not hip-hop, okay? That\\u2019s pop. He talks about going downtown on a scooter with his pals. Come on, bro. What? You\\u2019re gonna go downtown with your buddies on a scooter, Macklemore? That\\u2019s not hip-hop. Hip-hop doesn\\u2019t go downtown. Hip-hop lives downtown, and it goes to the suburbs and robs those people and comes back downtown. It doesn\\u2019t go downtown. Talking about thrift stores. Fuck you, bro. Don\\u2019t fucking talk about discount clothing! No! I don\\u2019t want to hear that, man. I want to hear a rapper be like\\u2026 And I\\u2019m like, \\u2018You got it, you got it.\\u2019 That\\u2019s what I want to hear, man. I want to hear Rick Ross be like\\u2026 That\\u2019s what I want to hear. Get out of here, Macklemore. What\\u2019s wrong with you, bro? This guy\\u2019s bullshit. We can\\u2019t call him hip-hop. It\\u2019s crazy that he\\u2019s hip-hop, \\u2019cause it\\u2019s not. It\\u2019s all some sensitive-ass shit. The thing that made me the most mad about Macklemore is he co-wrote this song he got a Grammy nomination for that arguably made him famous, right? It made him famous, right? It was called \\u2018Same Love.\\u2019 It was about same-sex marriage. Now, the song and the depth of the song I\\u2019m not against. I\\u2019m for same-sex marriage. I don\\u2019t give a shit who you want to marry, okay? You want to marry who you want to marry? Go crazy, man. You don\\u2019t fuck kids or animals, I don\\u2019t care. That\\u2019s it for me. No kids, no animals, we\\u2019re straight. You want to marry your toaster? Go crazy. Just don\\u2019t return that. I don\\u2019t want to buy that fucked toaster. So the song I\\u2019m okay with. It\\u2019s at the beginning of the song, the intro. He goes, \\u2018When I was in the third grade, I thought that I was gay.\\u2019 Remember this bullshit? I thought that I was gay. When I was in the third grade, I thought I was a gay person. That\\u2019s what he said. I thought I was one of you fellas. Thank God I\\u2019m not. I\\u2019m not, but I thought I was. I thought so. I hated that. I hated that \\u2019cause they applauded him. They were like, \\u2018Oh, how bold. \\u2018How brave of Macklemore. \\u2018He thought he was a homosexual. \\u2018In third grade, he thought he was a homosexual. \\u2018He\\u2019 s not, which is good, but he thought he was. He thought he was a gay.\\u2019 And they thought that was, like, a risky thing to say\\u2026 \\u2018I thought I was gay when I was in third grade.\\u2019 I hate that shit. You remember third grade? I do. Everybody was gay. Everybody in here in third grade was gay. You were all gay. I wore sweat pants. I played the recorder. I was very gay. I used to Rollerblade around my neighborhood, like, \\u2018Hey, fellas.\\u2019 I would fag out all day. Like\\u2026 I was homosexual, bro. It wasn\\u2019t a question. It was a fact. That kid\\u2019s gay as shit. Little redhead gay kid skating backwards. I was gay, man. I was gay when I was in third grade. You were all gay in third grade. I would beg my mom to let me sleep at other boys\\u2019 houses every night of the week. I want to sleep at Billy\\u2019s. What are you doing over there? None of your business, Mom! Make the call, please! I was so gay in third grade. If another boy accused me of liking girls, I\\u2019d fucking murder that kid. Chicago, Illinois, I got to go. I\\u2019m Andrew Santino. Thank you so much, man. Thank you, guys. I love you, Chicago. Everybody who\\u2019s anybody has lived in this building, man. Locals, baby\\u2026 Jordan, Pippen, Longley, Kerr, Paxton. You know it, dude. Ryne Sandberg used to own and live in one of those big white poles at the top. He would have to slide down for breakfast. Al Capone still lives in the basement. Not dead. It\\u2019s now called Willis, used to be called Macy\\u2019s Tower, after the Macy\\u2019s Thanksgiving Day Parade, because most of the floats are made right here in this building. It\\u2019s actually anatomically to scale\\u2026 even his balls. The penis is not. They ran out of clay, but the balls are full. And if you look right beyond me, that\\u2019s the Adams Street Bridge, named, of course, after the Addams Family. Duh-na-na-na. Oh, you want a fat dick in a bun or a little dick in a bun? I don\\u2019t want any penises on the hot dog, just a regular hot dog. Okay, we\\u2019re gonna give you a Trump dog, then. Gonna give me a Trump dog? Damn right. You know what? Let me tell you something. You\\u2019re not nice, and you\\u2019re not nice to people and\\u2026 We don\\u2019t give a fuck about your fucking soft ass. Yes. I\\u2019m sick of this abuse. All I want is\\u2026 Save that pussy-ass shit for somebody else that want to fucking hear it. Good night, pussy lips. Right. Fine, good night. Bye, dick cheese. Get the fuck out of here. I\\u2019m leaving. Pussy nose. Well, leave. Tweet, tweety bird. Hey, Andrew, I think the crew\\u2019s gonna head out of here. Cool, man. Get out. We\\u2019re wrapped. Yeah, I\\u2019m here. Do you need a ride, or are you good? I get in my\\u2026 I can walk. Okay. Cool. Good luck with your special or tour guide, whatever this is. Thanks, dude. Thank you, Bernard.

We\\u2019re gonna get things done. We\\u2019re gonna get things done that they\\u2019ve wanted to see done\\u2026 for a long, long time. What have you started on, Mr. President? We\\u2019re gonna get things done. We have, uh\\u2026 We\\u2019re taking on immigration, taking on education. We\\u2019re taking on so many aspects of things that, uh\\u2026 people were hopelessly tied up in knots in Congress, but you\\u2019ll see, uh\\u2026 levels of detail, levels of thought\\u2026 I would love to see detail. \\u2026that a lot of people believed very strongly we didn\\u2019t have in this country. Uh, Mr. President, it looks like you\\u2019re golfing. Things that nobody has even contemplated, thought about, thought possible. We\\u2019re gonna get things done. [coughs] So when are you gonna start on this stuff? So, I think we\\u2019ll start sometime on Tuesday? [Sarah] Tuesday works. Then we\\u2019re going into the immigration, the world of immigration and education. Immigration, education. You did mention that before. We\\u2019re going into the world of healthcare. Oh! I\\u2019m gonna let you get back\\u2026 \\u2026a lot of exciting\\u2026 \\u2026to starting on those plans, Mr. President. Thank you so much for calling us again. A lot of us are working from home, but some of us are twerking from home. Here to show us how she does it, please welcome Megan Thee Stallion. Hi, Sarah Cooper! Good morning, Megan. Sarah! [static] Can you hear me? Megan? [Megan] Sarah? Megan\\u2026 Megan, can you hear me? Sarah! Megan? Megan? [chuckles] We\\u2019re gonna get a little update from Scooter in a second. We\\u2019ll sort this right out. We\\u2019ll just move on. Scooter, are you getting the Internet? It seems to be working fine right here. Plenty of Wi-Fi. Plenty. Oh, my goodness, the Internet, right? Wi-Fi is so weird. Yeah. Do we need a modem, Scooter? We need a modem, yeah\\u2026 [chuckling] [Sarah] It\\u2019s a cable joke. [laughing] Hoop-dee-hoo! Yeah. We\\u2019ll have to wait between 10:00 a.m. and 6:00 p.m. for them to come in. [laughing] So funny. We might not have any Internet access, but in good news, we have a woman whose baked goods have become a national sensation. Not just for how they taste, but for what they wear. Please welcome, all the way from Wedgecot, New Jersey, the creator of Cupcake Shoes, K.J. Dillard. [Scooter] Think you\\u2019re going the wrong way. There we go. [director] All right, go to camera two. Beautiful. [in sing-song voice] My pretty. Little bit of curly hair for you. [gasps] [softly] There we go. Welcome, K.J.! [gasps] Oh, my God, you startled me. [chuckles] I\\u2019m here to do the Sarah Cooper show. And we are so excited to have you. These might be the cutest cupcakes I\\u2019ve ever seen. They are my pride and joy. Now I\\u2019d appreciate it if you got Sarah for me. Thank you. I\\u2019m Sarah Cooper. I didn\\u2019t say \\u201cSierra,\\u201d honey. I said \\u201cSarah.\\u201d That is Sarah Cooper. I\\u2019m Sarah Cooper, the host of the show. You\\u2019re Sarah Cooper? Yep. Can I see some ID? Here is my license, passport, and my birth certificate. No, I need to see some kind of a permit that shows me that you\\u2019re allowed to be on the premises. Okay, K.J., why don\\u2019t you tell our viewers how you came up with this fabulous idea? Well, I used to design these dolls called \\u201clittle pooples\\u201d that you\\u2019d put on the end of your toilet, and then I got tired because I wasn\\u2019t able to eat \\u2019em. So, should I be sharing personal information with this person? It just\\u2026 It helps with banter. I love this little guy. What is his name? His name is Broadway Berry \\u2019cause he\\u2019s berry-flavored, and he\\u2019s very fragile. Well, I am ready to make one. [gasps and exclaims] [dialing] [operator] 9-1-1, what\\u2019s your emergency? This is Karen June Dillard. Karen! I am with a person and my gut tells me she is up to no good. Scooter. I can\\u2019t hear anything. Got my gloves on. [K.J.] Yes, she\\u2019s a female. And I would say at least 70% Africo-American. Yes. Now she\\u2019s destroying my property! This is my property. [gasps] [woman] Welcome to \\u201cKarens.\\u201d I\\u2019m Whoopi Goldberg. In 1876, a Boston Karen bemoaned to her husband how taxing it was for her to walk miles into town every time she wanted to get a Black person arrested. He vowed to resolve this issue. \\u201cWife,\\u201d he said, \\u201cI shall make it so that you may summon the police on Black people from the comfort of our very home.\\u201d His name was Alexander Graham Bell. [Karen Bell] They\\u2019re standing by my horse! [horse neighs] [Whoopi] But the role of Karens did not start with the invention of the telephone. The New World was crawling with Karens. Karen over here, Karen over there, Karens every-goddamn-where. [Karen] They\\u2019re on my property! [Whoopi] Some even claim that they can trace the roots of Karens as far back as the book of Genesis. [Karen] They\\u2019re eating that snake\\u2019s apple! [Whoopi] When we come back, my actual next-door neighbor, Karen. I\\u2019ve got a few choice words to say to this bitch. [man] Sore muscles, back pain, headaches and weakness. If you have COVID-19, getting a good night\\u2019s sleep can be rough. But starting now, your pesky pains are over. From the makers of MrPillow comes a brand-new product, the MrPillow Coronavirus Vaccine. Hi. I\\u2019m Steve Windell, the creator of MrPillow and MrPillowPlus. For 20 years, I\\u2019ve dedicated my life to making firm yet fluffy pillows that don\\u2019t break the bank. So, I thought, \\u201cWhy not take the magic of MrPillow and use it to make a vaccine for coronavirus?\\u201d So, how does it work? It\\u2019s pretty simple, actually. The MrPillow Vaccine is made from thousands of tiny microscopic pillows shrunken down to the size of the deadly virus. Once injected into the bloodstream, these individualized pillows insert themselves under the novel coronavirus and lull it into a restful slumber. The virus now defenseless, the body\\u2019s immune cells can go to work. That\\u2019s how we here at MrPillow put the science back in sleep science. I got my friendly MrPillow Vaccine in the mail, and three days later, I already feel immune to COVID and ready to mix and mingle. I\\u2019m even going to a pool party later. Thank you, MrPillow. And I had COVID for three weeks and then I got it again! Hey! I think I\\u2019ll load up on that vaccine right now. Nurse? I feel better already. Order the MrPillow Coronavirus Vaccine for just four easy payments of $99, or $12,000 with insurance. The MrPillow Coronavirus Vaccine works. [man] The MrPillow Coronavirus Vaccine may cause coronavirus. [whirring] [Trump\\u2019s voice] Anynomous\\u2026 really anomous. [speaking alien language] Thank you so much to our viewers for your patience. We got our technical difficulties all figured out and we are so excited to welcome \\u201cshe likes to hoist up her moist stuff,\\u201d Megan Thee Stallion. Hey, Sarah Cooper! Megan, it is so amazing to have you here. You are such a legend. I have a question. I\\u2019m sure it\\u2019s on the minds of all our viewers. How are you dealing with this whole \\u201cnew normal\\u201d thing? Listen, Sarah Cooper, I\\u2019m not going outside until coronavirus is a memory, okay? Like, you can go back in the textbook and be like, \\u201cDamn, y\\u2019all remember coronavirus? That shit was crazy, right?\\u201d [chuckles] Yeah. So until then, I\\u2019m staying my ass in the house. [narrator] Sarah had to make a pee-pee, but knew she had to play it cool for the folks at home. I have to say, that ass you\\u2019re staying in the house is very nice. How do you look so good all the time? Well, you know, I like to work out, gotta keep that ass tight, sharp. [chuckling] Real hot-girl shit. [Sarah] Yeah, real hot-girl stuff. Any tips you can give us for working out at home? Definitely. I actually have this great workout called \\u201cDrink your drink.\\u201d Drink your drink? Goes like this. Get your cup, and one\\u2026 and two. And\\u2026 [mimics drink flowing] Is that cognac? Yes, Sarah Cooper, yeah, it is. I been doing this every day for quarantine and let me tell you, I feel great. Well, you look great. Thanks. You, too, can look like this. All you gotta do is grab some cognac, add a little squat to it. Even a little lunge. Real easy, like\\u2026 Mmm. Like that? A little more sexy and a little less like you sitting on the toilet. Somebody get her some cognac. Scooter, can I get some cognac? [Scooter] Yes. Trying to do the six feet, so\\u2026 So, all you gotta do is dip and sip. [both] Dip and sip. Dip and sip. Yep, yep, yep. [sexy music playing] I think I\\u2019m doing it! I\\u2019ve never twerked before in my life. [laughs] It\\u2019s happening. No, try it like this. Try it a little more sexy. Okay. Pow, pow, pow. Little hair flip. Girl, live your life, do you, be a hot girl. Everybody wasn\\u2019t meant to be in the twerk Olympics, so just do you, be you. Be the best Sarah Cooper you can be. I can do that. This is a really great workout. I know! Real hot-girl shit. [Scooter] If you don\\u2019t mind, this is supposed to be six feet. We certainly are lubed up here at the Everything\\u2019s Fine studio. We\\u2019ll be right back. [Scooter] All right, we are out. Good job. [cork pops] This stuff is really strong. [theme song playing] It\\u2019s the 3:00 a.m. hour here on QAnon QAC. Just a note, this is the real QAnon, not the other one people were saying was the real QAnon on 4chan. Please stop doxing me. I\\u2019ve had to move five times. Let\\u2019s check in with our viewers. Emma from Philadelphia. [Emma] Hey, Ashley. How are you this morning? Longtime caller, always listening. You blinked your right eye just now when you said this was the real QAnon. Was that a sign that you have been contacted by the god of fire? [chuckles] Don\\u2019t be ridiculous, Emma. That was a nervous tic in my eye. It was not a coded message. Believe me, you will know when I\\u2019ve been contacted by the god of fire. Thanks, Ashley. [ominous music playing] [easy jazz music playing] This morning, we are proud to feature our Indoctrination Porcelain Doll Collection. They\\u2019re stunning dolls, and yes, we do accept cryptocurrency, but only QCoin. Let\\u2019s take a look at these dolls. How adorable. It\\u2019s presidential mouthpiece, Kellyanne. [Kellyanne\\u2019s voice] Don\\u2019t be so overly dramatic about it, Chuck. What it\\u2026 You\\u2019re saying it\\u2019s a falsehood, and they\\u2019re giving Sean Spicer, our press secretary, gave\\u2026 alternative facts to that, but the point\\u2026 Ugh. Never a dull moment. This one just talks and talks and talks and talks and talks. Order soon as this one has recently been discontinued. [gasps] Ah! My naan! Thank you, Quincy. I\\u2019m so sorry. I am just so starving and it is hard to get good Indian food in this undisclosed location. [sniffs] Ahh! Next caller. [man] Hey, Ashley. [laughing] Mike from Minnesota, how are you again? Did you just get naan from Quincy? Is that a code for QAnon? Right? QAnon, a sign that you\\u2019re Q? I am not Q, I am just on in the middle of the night selling porcelain dolls. Q is in Washington uncovering a cabal of sex predators. I appreciate you sending me messages through the TV. Next we have, \\u201cI am woman, hear me roar, but very softly so I still sound sexy.\\u201d [softly] Ivanka. This doll teaches our daughters that it\\u2019s better to be seen and not heard. [Ivanka\\u2019s voice] If being complicit is wanting to\\u2026 Is wanting to be a force for good and to make a positive impact, then I\\u2019m complicit. [thunder cracks] [yells in fear] Whoo! The storm is coming. I told you this was the real QAnon. Next caller! [distorted voice] How\\u2019s it going? Are you saying we can expect a storm when the president will reveal the mass execution of the Washington figures responsible for murdering a DNC staffer? I\\u2019d say keep your eyes open, and coming up in the 4:00 a.m. hour, we have a phenomenal weighted blanket that you\\u2019re not gonna\\u2013 Weighted blankets are a media tool invented by George Soros. Watch your back, Ashley. I always do, honey. I have to. Finally, we have the best first lady, Melania. Beautiful, stunning, and really, what else do you need? [Melania\\u2019s voice] I\\u2019m very involved in charities now, many charities involving children, involving many different diseases. Hi\\u2026 Melania. All of these dolls are available now by calling 666-666-6666\\u2026 666666\\u2026 This is not the real QAnon. Get out now! [Christmas bells jangling] [Sarah] The former QAnon host starts her new job at the White House this week. [breaking news alert plays] We have some breaking news coming in. It appears the president is live-tweeting this program right now, and we\\u2019ve noticed a ratings bump when we show what he\\u2019s saying about us in real time, so\\u2026 that\\u2019s what we\\u2019re gonna do. Okay, so the president is saying that everything is not fine. Uh, I guess we\\u2019ll have to see if we can change the name of the show. [Scooter] I\\u2019m open to it. \\u201cNow they\\u2019re playing my tweet. Stop playing my tweet. That\\u2019s my tweet.\\u201d The president now thinks \\u201cthe country is totally fine\\u201d and \\u201cit\\u2019s the best it\\u2019s ever been.\\u201d \\u201cBecause of me.\\u201d Who, me? \\u201cNo, me, the president.\\u201d \\u201cBest president ever.\\u201d Oh. [cheerfully] Best president ever! And the president now likes our show again and our ratings are\\u2026 up! Great. More on these tweets as they continue to suck the life out of our democracy. [buzzer sounds] [theme song playing] [Scooter] Great segment. [Sarah] Thank you! [narrator] Sarah wasn\\u2019t sure the segment had gone great. She wasn\\u2019t sure of much at all anymore. [heart beating] [Scooter] Uh, we\\u2019re ready for robot CEO. I\\u2019m Sarah Cooper. [echoes] I\\u2019m Sarah Cooper. We\\u2019ll be right back. [director] We\\u2019re out. Do you know what I miss? Shawarma. I miss eating shawarma in a really crowded restaurant in close proximity to other diners. Yeah. People sitting two feet away from you just shoveling food into their disgusting mouths. [man] I miss that human connection. [director] Oh, Sarah. Hi. Why did you want to meet with us? You called me in here. [man] Okay, smarty pants. Let\\u2019s look at your file and see how your ratings are doing. I forgot. I can\\u2019t read. All right. [clears throat] Looks like 35% of our audience likes that you\\u2019re Black, 30% of our audience doesn\\u2019t like that you\\u2019re Black, 50% of our audience doesn\\u2019t know you\\u2019re Black, but thankfully, 80% of our audience feels extremely threatened by you, Sarah. It\\u2019s that attitude of yours. I don\\u2019t think I have an attitude. [man] There it is. There it is. The boss didn\\u2019t hire you to be aggressive. The boss hired you to be a non-threatening Black woman like Tootie and Lisa Turtle, and that other one. Lovable, but forgettable. Well, I think it might be a little confusing, because I\\u2019m named Sarah, and I feel like when my parents named me Sarah, a white lady just moved into my body and gentrified my whole personality, you know? Like, my mom would cook jerk chicken\\u2013 I love jerk chicken. He does. He\\u2019s a jerk. He loves the chicken. I love it. And I\\u2019d be like, \\u201cOh, this is too spicy.\\u201d And she\\u2019d say, [in Jamaican accent] \\u201cThere are children around the world, all they get for dinner is bread and water.\\u201d And I\\u2019d be like, \\u201cThat actually sounds pretty good.\\u201d Like, a scone and a chai latte. Yes, a scone and chai tea latte would be perfect. Any time of the day. Um\\u2026 That would be really great \\u2019cause I was born in Jamaica, but moved here when I was three. Jamaica. I knew it. I actually watched these characters when I was little. I mean, Tootie and Lisa and Hilary and\\u2026 and\\u2026 Um\\u2026 And that other one. I mean, these characters inspired me, you know? I feel like they ran so that I could sing. But you can\\u2019t sing, which is why you\\u2019re on the morning show and not on Broadway. Okay, I will tone it down. [director] Yeah. Stick to the news. All right? Leave politics out of it. Got it. Thank you. [man] Better go. Yeah. Marv, do you think I should buy another gun? Lorraine, what are you talking about? Are you crazy? Of course you should buy another gun. Thank you. We live in very dangerous times. You\\u2019re right. [Scooter] Hey, pals. How\\u2019s it going? Hi! Scooter. Hey, Scooter. What\\u2019s going on here? [Scooter] This is to keep things safe, six-foot distance. Smart. He\\u2019s so smart. [Scooter] Well, as you were. See you later. [Lorraine] Thank you. [Marvin chuckles] Get the door on your way out? [Scooter] Sure. I can\\u2019t touch the doorknob. Can you just shut the door, please? [Scooter] It\\u2019s not me, it\\u2019s the door. [Lorraine] Gotta get some work done. If you could\\u2013 Close the door! [Scooter] This has to get fixed. This is Connie Chung with the president this morning. Mr. President, what is your plan to unite the country? [Trump\\u2019s voice] I\\u2019m not a big fan of sharks either. I don\\u2019t know how many votes I\\u2019m gonna lose. I have people calling me up, \\u201cSir, we have a fund to save the shark, it\\u2019s called \\u2018Save the Shark.'\\u201d I say, \\u201cNo, thank you.\\u201d Oh, no. Mr. President, I was asking you about uniting the country. I think I am actually humble. I\\u2019m much more humble than you would understand. [mutters] Mr. President, I asked you about\\u2013 Excuse me. Stop and frisk. Okay? Stop and frisk. All right\\u2026 Excuse me. You take guns away. Rudy Giuliani was a great mayor. He did it in New York. He started it and it worked great. I\\u2019m sorry? Excuse me. You have people coming over with bags of soup, big bags of soup, and they lay it on the ground and the anarchists take it and they start throwing it at our cops. Bags of soup, big bags of soup. If it hits you, it\\u2019s worse than a brick \\u2019cause it\\u2019s got force. So, that was my interview with the president. Hi, I\\u2019m Steve Windell, and you\\u2019re gonna love my new line of MrPillow feminine hygiene products. Because your vagina deserves a tampon as soft and absorbant as one of my pillows. Try our down-feather version, too! [woman] In these uncertain times, we turn to familiar faces. And since 1975, we\\u2019ve been there for you\\u2026 Twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week. We had to go away for a while, but we knew it wouldn\\u2019t be long. Orgies. We\\u2019re back! [crowd cheering] Now with curbside pickup. [lullaby playing] [Trump\\u2019s voice] Thighland! Thighland! The super-duper missile. Mmm! Did you make this coffee, Scooter? I did not. [buzzer sounds] [theme song playing] [Sarah] Welcome back to Everything\\u2019s Fine. Big story this morning. As we\\u2019ve previously reported, a huge shake-up in the CEO world happened last Friday when we learned the CEO of Techtech Corp is actually a robot. Strangely, no one even noticed for several months. Live in studio via Camrojex technology, please welcome 8008s. Thanks, Sarah. It\\u2019s great to be here. [Sarah] Thank you for taking time out of your busy schedule. Well, I can multitask better than my human counterparts, Sarah. For example, right now, I\\u2019m chatting with you, doing Joe Rogan\\u2019s podcast, and kicking off a workplace diversity program all at the same time. Okay, so is it safe to assume you\\u2019re programmed to simply do everything your predecessors did? Unlike Elon Musk, I have a human side. [Scooter chuckles] Elon Musk. I was made by a great group of guys who really take social change seriously. For example, I\\u2019m programmed with the complete knowledge of feminist content such as Sex and the City, Cosmo and \\u201cHot Girl Summer.\\u201d I\\u2019m not sure I\\u2019d consider that feminist\\u2013 I\\u2019ve also learned about the Black experience in America by watching all three Barbershop movies, and the Beauty Shop spin-off. Okay, again, I\\u2019m not sure we\\u2013 I\\u2019m sorry. I\\u2019m being told that I\\u2019m getting off track. As president and CEO, my number-one job is to make my shareholders happy. But that\\u2019s kind of been the problem, hasn\\u2019t it? Big businesses just focusing on money, making myopic business moves that leave the whole country with more disparity and\\u2026 How are you doing that? Camrojex technology. Oh, wow. Just relax. This is really inappropriate. But technically, you\\u2019re a robot and I haven\\u2019t had a massage in months. [sensual song playing] That feels incredible. [sighs] Hold on, we have some breaking news. It\\u2019s been reported that Robot CEO 8008s has been fired by its board of directors after making unwanted advances toward an office printer. That printer knew exactly what it was doing. It was always asking me to make a copy. Because that\\u2019s its job. And it\\u2019s not just a printer, it has a name. HP Printer/Scanner/Copier 500s, whose side of the story I\\u2019m sure we all want to hear. Scooter, can we get HP Printer/Scanner/Copier 500s on the cloud system? Thank you so much for joining us, HP Printer/Scanner/Copier 500s. Tell us what happened. [beeping] Okay, wait, wait. I\\u2019ll, uh\\u2026 I\\u2019ll make a public statement. Okay? Just give me two seconds to think. After eight months of careful soul-searching, I\\u2019ve decided to address the hideous allegations against me. I have not, nor have I ever mistreated or abused a printer/scanner/copier. I value printers. My printer\\u2026 is a printer. HP Printer/Scanner/Copier 500s, is there anything you want to say? [whirring and beeping] Sounds like we\\u2019re getting a fax. [fax machine printing] \\u201cF*ck you, 8008s.\\u201d I will now step away to spend time with my family. [theme music playing] Wow. AI has come so far. [Scooter] Three, two, one. We\\u2019re out. Can\\u2019t believe he\\u2019s a robot. Ladies and gentlemen, please give a big Allstate Arena parking lot welcome to Sarah Evak. [car horn honking] Thank you all so much. Hi, my name is Sarah Evak and I\\u2019m a close-up card magician. Uh, I\\u2019ve been doing this for, I don\\u2019t know, ten years. I\\u2019ve been everywhere. Singapore, you name it. Tonight\\u2019s show is at the Allstate Arena in Rosemont. Pretty exciting for me. [chuckles] I\\u2019m going to begin by introducing you to my family. I call them my family because some I see often and others when I least expect them. Can everyone see these? I\\u2019m going to shuffle these cards and you tell me when to stop. [horn honking] [Sarah] Okay, I haven\\u2019t started shuffling yet. [horn toots] Now I\\u2019m shuffling. [horns honking] Got it. Now I\\u2019m going to show you all this card. Can everyone see this card? [horns honking] Does anyone work here? [horns honking] Can you take this card and show it? Yeah. Don\\u2019t show it to me. Oh, okay. During COVID, I\\u2019m also a teacher in a Zoom Room. But this\\u2026 This is where I come alive. Beep when you\\u2019ve seen it. And\\u2013 [horn beeps] [horn beeps] [man] I\\u2019ve never worked with a magician. I was a Frankenstein at a haunted house once, though. So, you know, I\\u2019m used to being around performers. Is this your card? I had to get out of that racket \\u2019cause of the Illuminati. You know, they want to get you. [horn beeps] It\\u2019s like, not for me. Nope, I\\u2019ll stick to parking lot attendant. That\\u2019s the life for me. Simple. [car horns blaring] I think it went okay. Yeah. I might have to buy giant cards for shows like these in the future. Um\\u2026 I don\\u2019t know. There\\u2019s a lot of beeping. So, when is this gonna be on? I just wanna make sure that I catch it. [man] Uh, sometime next year. Okay. Do you want to see another trick? No? Okay. [woman] We followed the guidelines. We reopened when it was safe. But now, it\\u2019s not safe again. [crowd] Aw! [man 1] Honestly? [woman] Orgies. Maybe later. [man 2] Damn it. Wonderful place. Wonderful. Oh, my goodness. Unbelievable. Oh, hello. My name is Natalie, and this is my husband, John. Hi, there. [chuckles] Welcome to Mar-a-Lago. We love it here. It is beautiful. You hear me? Oh, it\\u2019s gorgeous. I know what you\\u2019re thinking. \\u201cDo they allow Black people at Mar-a-Lago?\\u201d Um, we\\u2019re here! Right? Laugh it off. We are Black-ish, though. Last time we checked. Last time we checked, we were. Yes. And we\\u2019ve actually met the president. He saw us\\u2026 Yes, we did. \\u2026and he said that we are his two favorite Black people. And he says it every single time. Every time. Mmm-hmm. Such a charismatic personality he has. He\\u2019s such a celebrity. We actually got married here. Um, not in the big ballroom, but on the property. So it was still beautiful. Yes. Yeah. We\\u2019re not allowed in there right now. We\\u2019re not allowed in there yet, but there is a small room off to the side with a private entrance, very exclusive. [laughs] And they said we can go in there whenever we want. We can stay in there if we want to. Anytime. And then, one night, we actually got locked in there. And let\\u2019s just say it was very fortuitous. Yes, it got kind of hot in there. [ominous music playing] We just love it here. Just surrounded by all our friends. Surrounded by all of our friends, which is the most important part. We got you in our hearts. Right on. [Sarah] If you like skateboarding dogs, you\\u2019re gonna wanna stick around after Everything\\u2019s Fine for Thinking Outside the Bachs with Jordana Bachman. [Jordana] I don\\u2019t know what this is about to be, but okay! [Sarah] Coming up at the twelve o\\u2019clock hour. Let\\u2019s do the weather segment. Love the weather. Love the weather! [Lorraine] Mmm. [theme song playing] Okay, weather segment in three, two\\u2026 And now, let\\u2019s check in on how the sky\\u2019s doing today with our meteorologist, Andrea Steele. Thanks, Sarah. Well, we\\u2019re looking at some real clear skies today, up to 75 degrees. Absolutely beautiful out. Let\\u2019s look ahead at the five-day forecast. Tuesday, we\\u2019re gonna see a bit of rain, but break out that summer gear as temperatures shoot up to a whopping 103 degrees. Wednesday, out of nowhere, there\\u2019s gonna be a ferocious hailstorm with sustained winds up to 75-plus miles per hour. Scooter, you may wanna board up your windows. My windows are always boarded up. You know that weird house in your neighborhood that\\u2019s got all the boards up in the windows, and everyone thinks, \\u201cIs that an abandoned hospital?\\u201d That\\u2019s my place. Excellent. Thursday, you might wanna break out the sunscreen again, because it\\u2019s gonna be a hot one. 123 degrees with a humidity index so high, a friend of mine who works at the EPA called me crying. He\\u2019s a grown man. Friday, we shoot down to negative 12 degrees with a windchill index we weren\\u2019t even able to calculate using a Doppler 8000 technology. It\\u2019s gonna be a cold one, folks. Most likely not survivable, so wear a jacket. And Saturday, temperatures radically return to breezy 75 degrees. However, that isn\\u2019t just a cute graphic we made up. We\\u2019re actually projecting literal flaming snowmen to be walking the streets with some possible fire tornado watches in effect. Everything\\u2019s fine with the weather. I\\u2019m Andrea Steele. Back to you, Sarah. Andrea, I\\u2019m sorry, but that forecast is\\u2013 Insane? Uh, yeah. You think? I mean, I\\u2019ve been doing the weather for 17 years, Sarah, and I have never seen anything like this in my entire lifetime. You think I like telling people they\\u2019re gonna die, or their skin might peel off if they run to the grocery store? No one should be going outside unless they absolutely have to. [heart beating] Scooter? [narrator] Everything was not fine. [exhales deeply] Scooter, are you asleep? [narrator] Had the world gone mad? Andrea, are you okay? [scoffs] Am I okay? This b!tch. Am I okay? Um\\u2026 No, actually, \\u2019cause we got a bat disease just floating around in the sky, there\\u2019s a new natural disaster every motherf*cking day, factories destroying the environment. Look at this damn forecast behind me. This is the first time I\\u2019ve left my house in months! All it takes is one wrong motherf*cker to breathe on me funny, and I swear to God\\u2026 Scooter, are we still on a nine-second delay? The woman who presses that button stopped coming in weeks ago. Well, in that case, let me just say this. F*ck, sh!tty, doo-doo, b!tch, and stay the f*ck in your house. Reporting live from hell on earth, this is Andrea motherf*cking Steele. Back to you, Sarah. That was great. We\\u2019ll be right back. [buzzer sounds] Great. We\\u2019re out. Nice. Wow. So that\\u2019s your house I walk by every day. [Scooter] Yeah. Ah. My kids are terrified to go past there. [chuckling] That\\u2019s the one. It doesn\\u2019t look like anyone\\u2019s lived there in hundreds of years. [Scooter] That\\u2019s my place. [Andrea] Interesting. Well, it\\u2019s safe. It\\u2019s spooky. [Scooter] Yeah. It\\u2019s awful there. Everybody ready? Here we go. Five, four, three, two, one. Welcome back to Everything\\u2019s Fine. I\\u2019m Sarah Cooper. And now for our top story, an exclusive look inside that now-famous Access Hollywood bus. [man\\u2019s voice] She used to be great. Still beautiful. [Trump\\u2019s voice] I moved on her. She was down in Palm Beach. I moved on her and I failed, I\\u2019ll admit it. Whoa. I did try and fuck her. She was married. That\\u2019s huge news there. [Trump\\u2019s voice] No, Nancy\\u2026 This was\\u2026 And I moved on her very heavily. In fact, I took her out furniture shopping. She wanted to get some furniture. I said, \\u201cI\\u2019ll show you where they have some nice furniture.\\u201d Took her out furniture\\u2013 I moved on her like a b!tch. But I couldn\\u2019t get there, and she was married. All of a sudden I see her, she\\u2019s now got the big phony tits and everything. She\\u2019s changed her look. Sheesh, your girl\\u2019s hot as shit. In the purple. [all] Whoa! [Billy Bush\\u2019s voice] Yes! Yes! The Donald has scored! [all laughing] Oh, my man! Wait, you gotta look at me when you\\u2026 [indistinct chatter] Thumbs up. [Trump\\u2019s voice] You\\u2019re a pussy. You gotta put the thumbs up. Gotta get the thumbs up. You can\\u2019t be too happy. [man 1] Let me\\u2026 [man 2] That\\u2019s funny. You and I will walk out. Oh, my God. [indistinct chatter] Maybe it\\u2019s a different one. Better not be the publicist. No, it\\u2019s her. [Trump\\u2019s voice] Yeah, that\\u2019s her. With the gold. I gotta use some Tic Tacs, just in case I start kissing her. I\\u2019m automatically attracted to beautiful\\u2026 I just start kissing them. It\\u2019s like a magnet, I just kiss. [laughing] I don\\u2019t even wait. And when you\\u2019re a star, they let you do it. Just kiss. Just\\u2026 You can do anything. Whatever you want. Grab \\u2019em by the p*ssy. I can do anything. I can do anything. Those legs, all I can see is the legs. Oh, it looks good. Come on, shorty. Ooh, nice legs, huh? Oof. Get out of the way, honey. That\\u2019s good legs. Go ahead. It\\u2019s always good if you don\\u2019t fall out of the bus. Like Ford, Gerald Ford, remember? [Bush\\u2019s voice] Down below. Pull the handle. Hello. How are you? Hi. [Zucker\\u2019s voice] How are you? [Trump\\u2019s voice] Terrific. Pleasure to meet you. You know Billy Bush? Hello, nice to see you. How you doing, Arianne? I\\u2019m doing well, thank you. Ready to be a soap star? We\\u2019re ready. Make me a soap star. How about a hug for the Donald? He just got off the bus. Want a little hug? [Trump\\u2019s voice] Absolutely. Melania said this was okay. Hug for the Bushy? I just got off the bus. Oh! Bushy. [Bush\\u2019s voice] Here we go. Excellent. Excellent. Excellent. You\\u2019ve got a nice costar here. Yes. Absolutely. [Trump\\u2019s voice] After you. [heart beating] Great. We\\u2019re out. Nice. Scooter, what is happening? [both laughing] [Lorraine] This job is made for you, Marvin. Yeah, it keeps me out of trouble, as they say. Everything\\u2019s fine. Three, two, one, and we\\u2019re in. Sarah. And now, a little preview of what\\u2019s coming on after Everything\\u2019s Fine. We\\u2019ll have Jordana Bachman of Thinking Outside the Bachs, followed by Sandy Manderson, Miyoko Loco, and then, Andre Cole Watkins of Watkins the News. Stick around, it\\u2019s gonna be a great day. Isn\\u2019t it, Scooter? Miyoko Loco. [chuckles] A little help here. Save me. How about Sandy Manderson? Her face froze? Help. Tomorrow, something bad happens to your favorite celebrity. We\\u2019ll have a full report. Now, it\\u2019s over to Jordana Bachman for Thinking Outside the Bachs. Jordana, how are you doing? I\\u2019m doing good, girl. How are you, sister-friend? I\\u2019m doing so good. What do you got going on on the show today? Oh, well, let me tell you. A little bit of this, a little bit of that. Who knows? It\\u2019s the news. Who cares? You know, Jordana, I just realized we don\\u2019t have to do this anymore. You have to tell me. Do what? Do what? [laughing] This whole BFF handoff like we\\u2019re friends, laughing like we care about each other. We don\\u2019t care about each other. [Jordana] That, girl, is good news, because everyone can see through the bullsh!t! I don\\u2019t even know where you live. I don\\u2019t even see you except in this TV screen. That\\u2019s how I feel, just seeing you through a little box. What have you been up to? Girl, I\\u2019ve been up to so much. I\\u2019ve locked up every Black man in my life. I put my dad in a closet, my brother in a closet, my uncle in a closet, to make sure they live another day. Wow. Where do you put your clothes? [laughing] Oh, my God. What are we doing? Scooter.

I would do it sooner because we want relations with Iran to go as poorly as possible. Put it in 2021. [Lorraine] Okay. Yes. What if we shave two tons off the Greenland ice sheet? Yeah, yeah, yeah. 2028 or 2022? 2027. And let\\u2019s do something with bugs. I don\\u2019t know. Hornets! Who love to murder. [upbeat music playing] [both] Murder hornets! Oh! Yeah, yeah, yeah. And China seizes Hong Kong, 2028. And that pairs very nicely with the US gassing its own citizens. [giggles] Floods, 2026. What if Tom Hanks gets sick? Do it! He\\u2019s due! Kill off Mr. Peanut? Cancel Coachella. I hate those bands. Eating bats? I\\u2026 No, that\\u2019s too much. Let\\u2019s set Australia on fire! Turn the sky red! [distorted voice] Do it all in 2020. Really, boss?

What you gonna do? [in normal voice] Oh, my God. I don\\u2019t know where that came from. [narrator] At this moment, Sarah Cooper realized it wasn\\u2019t she who had lost her mind, it was the world. Scooter, help me out. Um\\u2026 You should just take the afternoon off. I just went scuba diving. I love scuba diving. You scuba dive? Love it. Maybe we should give her a raise. A raise would be great. [both laughing] I\\u2019m not gonna get a raise. I am a woman, so that does make more sense. Take all the time you need, Sarah. [in distorted voice] Never running out of news down here. Great. Okay. Well, I will just see you a little later.

Number one, I need you to treat women with respect always. Even if you think you\\u2019re right, be respectful. Number two, don\\u2019t mix white and dark liquor. That\\u2019s how you end up in the back of a police car. Speaking of which, get you a white friend. Black men with white friends are 38% less likely to be shot by the police. Are you listening?

I\\u2019m just saying, the flag had a couple upsides. Let\\u2019s just be real about it. I ain\\u2019t saying keep it around, but I grew up in the South. I can\\u2019t tell you how many times the Confederate flag came in handy. You stopping for gas at a strange place at 2:00 in the morning, you see that flag hanging from the window, you know this is not the place to get gas. And you keep it moving. What\\u2019s the rush to get rid of the flag? Especially if you white. If you white, you should want to keep the flag for a little while longer so at least black folks will know you cool. \\u2018Cause if you white and you not an asshole, that\\u2019s the one thing that helps us identify you. You get rid of that flag, we\\u2019ll be\\u2013 Mm-mmm. We got to figure out a way to know who the cool white people\\u2013 Cool white people, we just got to start giving y\\u2019all wristbands or handstamps.

I talked to my uncle about it. You know, my uncle. \\u201cFirst thing we need to do is get rid of the N-word.\\u201d My uncle don\\u2019t like the N-word, my Uncle Derek. Hate the N-word, be trying to\\u2013 My uncle trying to quit the N-word the way people try to quit cigarettes, a little bit at a time. It\\u2019s a word. Ain\\u2019t no cravings. Either you say it or you don\\u2019t. My uncle be calling me every week with updates. \\u201cI only said it four times this week. \\u201cMm-hmm. \\u201cOnly said that four times. \\u201cNow, Sunday\\u2019s my cheat day, \\u2019cause I watch football. \\u201cI got to say it. I got to say it on Sunday. \\u201cGrown man drop a first down, I got to call him the N-word. That\\u2019s just what it is.\\u201d And this is my thing with the N-word, like\\u2013 Like, at this point, black folks, like, if we trying to get stuff done politically in this country\\u2013 We inching, we doing, we inching, we inching, but at this point, I think it\\u2019s time for us to schedule a meeting with gay people, \\u2019cause gay people get way more shit done than us. [applause] They don\\u2019t mess around. Gay people shut shit down. They want something to go away, it\\u2019s gone. They don\\u2019t fool around, man. Every week, it\\u2019s five, six new words you can\\u2019t call gay people. Black folks, we\\u2019ve been working on the N-word since 1804. We can\\u2019t get one word out the American vocabulary. Gay people up to 37 words. We need to go to Panera and have a meeting with gay people, and have a soup and salad and figure this out. Yeah, that\\u2019s how you figure out your issues, over soup and salad. You can\\u2019t even say \\u201cgay\\u201d no more. That\\u2019s how good gay people are. The only word left to address gay people by. You better not fumble that word in a sentence. That\\u2019s your ass. You use \\u201cgay\\u201d in the wrong context at work and see if you don\\u2019t have to go talk to Sylvia in HR. HR be on your ass immediately \\u2019cause you mumbled \\u201cgay\\u201d one time the wrong way. You was by yourself when you said the shit and you still got in trouble. It\\u2019s not like you was walking through the cubicles telling gay jokes, you was\\u2026 You was in the break room, you was alone, and your chips got stuck and you cussed. That don\\u2019t mean you a bad person, you was just hungry. You say anything when you\\u2019re hungry. Every man in this room, we\\u2019ve all been through it. Them chips get stuck at the top of the machine, and you try to jostle the machine a little bit. Them chips don\\u2019t fall, ain\\u2019t nobody got change for a dollar, so you can buy two packs, so you gotta shake\\u2026 \\u201cGive me the chips, you gay-ass machine!\\u201d \\u201cSylvia, line two. Sylvia, line two. Security to the break room, security to the break room.\\u201d And that\\u2019s it and you gone \\u2019cause you called some chips gay. But that\\u2019s the power of the gay agenda. They figured out a way to influence the political process of this country to make sure that their issues are at least heard. Even if people don\\u2019t get the bills passed, they at least listen to \\u2019em, and that\\u2019s what I\\u2019m trying to tell my uncle. You don\\u2019t like the N-word, man, you wanna get rid of the N-word, this all you gotta do. Start calling gay people n i g g a s. [laughter and applause] It\\u2019ll be gone tomorrow. Listen, I don\\u2019t like it either, all right, but that\\u2019s the best idea I got right now, okay? At least that\\u2019s what I\\u2019m gonna teach my son. I\\u2019m a father figure. I got to show him the right way. They try to divide us on television, you know. But there\\u2019s a lot of people that aren\\u2019t black that\\u2019s standing on the right side of issues that affect us. I appreciate those folks, you know. [applause] They don\\u2019t get highlighted enough. There\\u2019s plenty of people out there that care about black stuff. I done seen \\u2019em, man. I went to\\u2013 I went to a black history museum, I had a white tour guide. Hey, it threw me off for a second. I turned to the brother that was on the tour with me, I was like, \\u201cIs this the dude? He\\u2019s gonna do it?\\u201d It was a white dude, it was a white dude telling me about my shit. And he was good! Yeah, I was trying to hate on him. By the end of the tour, I was like, \\u201cYo, bro, you did your thing, man. \\u201cStraight up, fam, you do what you do. \\u201cHey, real quick, let me give you \\u201cone of these wristbands real quick. \\u201cYeah, put that on. In case it go down, you want to wear that wristband.\\u201d I know some folks got a problem with that. You don\\u2019t want a white person at a black history museum, I understand that. Here\\u2019s the thing. I\\u2019m not saying they\\u2019re better than a black tour guide. I think a black tour guide at a civil rights museum, I think they\\u2019re better equipped to speak on the experience, because they might\\u2019ve lived that life, they can speak to certain exhibits from a perspective that nobody else can. I just think if you go to a black history museum and you got a black tour guide, you need to go in the morning while he\\u2019s still in a good mood. \\u2018Cause that brother is stressed. You can\\u2019t walk around slavery all day for eight hours and not cuss at somebody. [cheers and applause] Somebody getting cussed. You gotta catch him at 9:00 a.m. He just finished that McGriddle. \\u201cHow y\\u2019all doing? \\u201cMy name is Charles, it\\u2019s my pleasure \\u201cto take you on this journey. \\u201cLook at these exhibits right here. \\u201cBlack history is American history. Come look at the exhibits.\\u201d You think that brother gonna be in a good mood at 4:30, he been staring at slavery? That dude liable to cuss out everybody. \\u201cLook at this shit! \\u201cCome look what you done to us! \\u201cCome look what you done to us! \\u201cLook what you\\u2013 Get your ass out my museum, motherfucker!\\u201d You go to the gift shop, it\\u2019s just people crying. That\\u2019s horrible. That\\u2019s scary. Something\\u2019s wrong, man. Just don\\u2019t be one of these people that\\u2019s surprised that black folks got issues. Them the people I can\\u2019t deal with. I\\u2019d rather talk to somebody that don\\u2019t agree with me than somebody that\\u2019s had they eyes closed. \\u201cHey, did you know black people\\u2013 Why are black people angry?\\u201d Motherfucker, we been angry. This ain\\u2019t new. You think this just happened last couple of years? Black folks been trying to tell y\\u2019all forever that they had some issues and we sat\\u2013 We invented the blues! [laughter and applause] What more of a sign did you need? We literally invented an entire genre of music based on sadness, that\\u2019s how sad we were. And we\\u2013 the blues was created here. That is an American art form. That is not native African\\u2013 Go listen to old African music. The shit is happy \\u2019cause we was free. [cheers and applause] Go back. Every old African song. \\u266a We have freedom in Africa \\u266a\\n\\u266a Freedom in Africa \\u266a\\n\\u266a Freedom, got freedom in Africa \\u266a Soon as we got off the slave ship. [imitating blues guitar] [imitating harmonica] We\\u2019ve been sad. How the hell are you surprised? \\u201cYeah, but, they\\u2019re not patriotic. \\u201cBlack people don\\u2019t like the national anthem anymore. What is\\u2026\\u201d That ain\\u2019t no shock to you, man. You wanna know what black folks feeling? Just listen to their music. Our music tell you everything that\\u2019s going on in the black psyche. It\\u2019s a beautiful\\u2026 telegram. [applause] And nowhere in the history of black music is there a hit patriotic song. That ain\\u2019t what we do. I mean, we\\u2019ll cover a song, but, like, we don\\u2019t write no original patriotic songs. Black artists ain\\u2019t never\\u2013 \\u2018Cause we got a conflicted relationship with the country. You can\\u2019t write no honest patriotic song. You gotta leave that to white artists. They done had a good time. You had a good time in America, you damn right you should be writing a patriotic\\u2013 \\u266a And I\\u2019m proud to be an American \\u266a\\n\\u266a Where at least I know I\\u2019m free \\u266a [cheers and laughter] They be serious. You couldn\\u2019t possibly expect that level of patriotism from a race of people that have had so many issues, you can\\u2019t. It\\u2019s not realistic. Black people don\\u2019t\\u2013 We don\\u2019t sing about America. We sing about specific cities where you can have a good-ass time. That\\u2019s what we do. We don\\u2019t talk about the country. We can tell you where the party at, though. We can do that. Look, I can\\u2019t tell you nothing about America, but let me tell you about the city where the heat is on all night on the beach \\u2019til the early morn. Welcome to Miami, that\\u2019s where you got to go. You ever been to California? Oh, my God, boy, you got to go down to California, boy. Boy, California knows how to party. The city of L.A., the city of good ol\\u2019 Watts and the city of Compton. They keep it rockin\\u2019. Write that shit down, I\\u2019m trying to tell you. They keep it rockin\\u2019. Black people don\\u2019t do patriotism. Maybe \\u201cGeorgia on My Mind.\\u201d That\\u2019s the closest we probably come. Maybe that, maybe that. That\\u2019s a good song, it\\u2019s warm, it\\u2019s about the country. Ray Charles, \\u201cGeorgia on My Mind,\\u201d good song. But\\u2026 the key word in that song is \\u201con my mind.\\u201d Ray Charles was just thinking about Georgia. He didn\\u2019t tell you to go there. Georgia\\u2019s like every other part of the South. It\\u2019s got some pockets you should not be in after dark. If you\\u2019d have asked Ray Charles to be more specific on where in Georgia to go, he\\u2019d have said to go to Atlanta where the players play and they ride in them thangs like every day. [cheers and applause] [chuckles] My Uncle Derek tried to shut me down on that one. \\u201cWhat about James Brown \\u2018Livin\\u2019 in America\\u2019? \\u201cThat\\u2019s patriotic, James Brown singing about America. It\\u2019s original and he black.\\u201d \\u266a Livin\\u2019 in America \\u266a\\n\\u266a Eye to eye \\u266a\\n\\u266a Livin\\u2019 in\\u2026 \\u266a It\\u2019s a good song, but keep it real, man. James Brown wrote that song for Rocky IV, and as soon as he finished singing it, Apollo Creed died in the ring. It\\u2019s a sad song. It\\u2019s a sad song. How can you hear \\u201cLivin\\u2019 in America\\u201d\\u2018 and not think about Apollo Creed just falling lifeless to the\\u2013 Michael B. Jordan lost his daddy that day. If anything, \\u201cLivin\\u2019 in America\\u201d is not patriotic. It\\u2019s the opposite. It\\u2019s a secret message to black people. James Brown is one of the most masterful musicians to ever walk this earth, dude. It\\u2019s a brilliant song. [cheers and applause] That song ain\\u2019t got nothing to do with America. That entire song, \\u201cLivin\\u2019 in America\\u201d is a secret message to black folks. All you gotta do, listen to the end of the song. Very end of \\u201cLivin\\u2019 in America,\\u201d all James Brown do is just start naming cities. That\\u2019s it, end of the song. \\u266a Livin\\u2019 in America \\u266a\\n\\u266a New Orleans, Detroit City \\u266a\\n\\u266a Dallas, Pittsburgh \\u266a\\n\\u266a Kansas City, Atlanta \\u266a He just naming safe places for black folks. That\\u2019s\\u2013 that\\u2019s it. Love black music, man. Hits you, you know. That\\u2019s why I have\\u2013 That\\u2019s why I have a hard time going to see civil rights movies. I have to go see civil right movies in the middle of the day so nobody can see me crying. \\u2018Cause them movies be hitting you, man. Civil rights movies get me with that Negro humming. Oh, my God, I break down. \\u2018Cause you know, every civil rights movie just got that scene where it\\u2019s just some humming. \\u266a Freedom \\u266a [humming] You tell me that don\\u2019t break you down, in the middle of a civil rights movie, just that humming? There don\\u2019t even be nothing serious happening on screen, I be crying. It\\u2019s just a dude putting butter on a waffle, and just\\u2026 [humming] \\u266a Freedom \\u266a [humming continues] You be in the theater bawling. \\u201cHe was just putting butter on the waffle! They wouldn\\u2019t let him, they wouldn\\u2019t let him.\\u201d Civil rights movies get me all the time, man. They get me with that humming, and then they always make black people fall in slow motion. Yo, every civil rights movie, a black person fall in slow\\u2013 Why you got to slow down my pain? Just play it at regular speed. Any time a black person falls in a civil rights movie, they fall, then they do that double bounce in the dirt and the dirt come up. \\u201cGet out of here, darkie! Just get out!\\u201d \\u201cOhhh!\\u201d Pfft! Pfft! [cheers and applause] Don\\u2019t do that to me. Most powerful civil rights movie scene of all time is Selma. I can name the scene. It\\u2019s when Oprah Winfrey got slapped. This dude slapped the fire\\u2013 It was the second time, not the first time she got slapped, the second time. This dude slapped Oprah Winfrey so hard, she fell in slow motion and there was Negro humming. I left the theater. I couldn\\u2019t even tell you how the movie ended. It was too powerful. My emotions. First of all, Oprah couldn\\u2019t have known she was getting slapped. She didn\\u2019t know. She didn\\u2019t know she was getting slapped. That dude\\u2013 That was Ava DuVernay, that was the director, she made that choice. That\\u2019s a good-ass director, Ava DuVernay went up to that actor between scenes. \\u201cOkay, we love what you\\u2019re doing, okay? \\u201cWe\\u2019re getting a lot of good stuff from you. \\u201cWe\\u2019re just gonna change it up this scene. \\u201cOkay, this time, this time, \\u201cOprah\\u2019s gonna come over, okay? \\u201cShe\\u2019s gonna do her lines, and Oprah, \\u201cshe finishes her lines, you slap the shit out, just\\u2013 slap Oprah.\\u201d \\u201cDoes Oprah know?\\u201d \\u201cNo, do what I tell you! I\\u2019m Ava DuVernay! Slap Oprah!\\u201d Oprah came over to that dude, man. You could see it in her face. She didn\\u2019t know that\\u2013 that slap was coming. \\u201cWe ain\\u2019t leaving till we get our rights.\\u201d Skaboom! \\u266a Oh, freedom \\u266a [humming] Pfft! Pfft! The thing about this country is this: We\\u2019re all Americans. People love to say that. That\\u2019s the first thing people want to say when\\u2013 when there\\u2019s some tension. \\u201cOh, we\\u2019re all Americans. \\u201cYou\\u2019re American and I\\u2019m American. \\u201cWell, just, hell, we all Americans. Can\\u2019t we just be all Americans?\\u201d Yeah, we are. We all Americans. But we live in two different Americas. That\\u2019s what it is. People forget that. And I don\\u2019t think everybody that\\u2026 doesn\\u2019t understand what we go through is necessarily racist or bigoted. That\\u2019s\\u2013 That\\u2019s a far jump. It\\u2019s a lot of folks that just straight up don\\u2019t know what it\\u2019s like. And you gotta educate \\u2019em. You gotta educate \\u2019em on the kind of America you live in. I had to go Best Buy and give a dude some straightening. Straighten his ass out, yeah. I\\u2019m straightening. Dude at Best Buy gonna decide I don\\u2019t need a bag with my purchase. \\u201cYou just have an iPhone case. I figure you could just pop that open.\\u201d No, I ain\\u2019t popping shit. You put it in a bag. I need that in a bag. \\u201cWhat do you need a bag for? \\u201cI don\\u2019t understand why you need a bag. \\u201cIt\\u2019s wasteful. Recycle. Don\\u2019t you care about the Earth?\\u201d I go, \\u201cSir, this has nothing to do with the Earth. \\u201cI\\u2019m a black man in America. I gotta leave this store with a bag, bro.\\u201d [cheers and applause] It\\u2019s about safety. I\\u2019m black, I don\\u2019t get the luxury of just walking out with shit in my hand. That is a roll of the dice. That is a horrifying day if I\\u2013 No, not only do I need that bag, bitch, I need that receipt! And staple it to the outside. I don\\u2019t want a receipt in my hand. You staple my receipt to the outside like Chinese carryout, and I\\u2019ll hold it up in the air, I\\u2019ll \\u201cLion King\\u201d\\u2013 I\\u2019ll \\u201cHakuna Matata\\u201d an iPhone case out of Best Buy. And it\\u2019s not his fault. He just didn\\u2019t understand. He thought he was saving the Earth, but he was saving a life, that\\u2019s what he was doing. This has nothing to do with recycling, man. \\u2018Cause, see, you might be a cool person. He might\\u2013 The cashier might be a cool-ass dude, but we don\\u2019t know what the security guard been through up front. I come prancing out of Best Buy with this naked-ass iPhone case in my hand. And here comes security. \\u201cExcuse me, sir. Did you pay for that?\\u201d Oh, yeah, I got the receipt. \\u201cHe\\u2019s going for a gun!\\u201d Skaboom! \\u266a Oh, freedom, ohh \\u266a Pfft! Pfft! [cheers and applause] Everything ain\\u2019t racism. About 2%, it\\u2019s about 2%\\u2026 that ain\\u2019t racism. You gotta recognize that 2% when you see it. I was in McDonald\\u2019s, this dude was cussing everybody out. Swore it was racism. I walked in this fast food spot, this dude cussing everybody out. And this is the thing, like, fast food spots already do shady stuff, so I\\u2019m not saying they don\\u2019t deserve to be cussed out. They do, they deserve a good cussing every now and then, \\u2019cause the thing they do now, some of these fast food spots, they love to charge you for sauce when you get nuggets. [audience murmurs] You know, you want an extra sauce with your nuggets, it\\u2019s gonna be\\u2013 \\u201cOh, you want another sauce, brother, it\\u2019s gonna be 25 cents.\\u201d How you charging for sauce, bro? That\\u2019s\\u2013 I want two sauces. \\u201cWell, I need a quarter.\\u201d You ever meet the Guardian of the Sauce? This dude is serious. Done got a different color shirt from everybody else at work, so now he arrogant. \\u201cWell, you know, brother, I\\u2019m a supervisor now. \\u201cI have a shirt on. You know, if it was up to me, I would give you another sauce.\\u201d It is up to you! It\\u2019s on your side of the counter! I just want two sauces without paying for \\u2019em, that\\u2019s all I want. But I walked in this spot, man, this dude was cussing out the whole store. Swore it was racism. And I\\u2019m not saying that racism wasn\\u2019t one of the causes for him getting bad service, I\\u2019m just saying, he jumped to that conclusion a little fast. He didn\\u2019t go through the progressions. He ordered a six-piece nugget, and it was five nuggets in the box. And I didn\\u2019t even know what was going on. I\\u2019m texting, as soon as I walk in the door, I\\u2019m texting, I hear this dude, I hear this dude over in the cut, I hear this dude go, \\u201cI\\u2019ll kill everybody in this bitch.\\u201d [laughter and applause] You know, that\\u2013 that gave me pause, \\u2019cause he said he\\u2019ll kill everybody in this bitch. And I already had a foot in the door. Am I technically in this bitch, sir? \\u2018Cause I can pull this foot out and go to Arby\\u2019s. It ain\\u2019t that deep. Swore it was racism, man. \\u201cY\\u2019all stole my nugget. I\\u2019m tired of white folks.\\u201d \\u201cWhite folks don\\u2019t want us to have shit! Stole my nugget!\\u201d Then he gonna turn to me. \\u201cYou see this shit, brother? You see this McDonald\\u2019s? \\u201cIt\\u2019s our nuggets today. It\\u2019s our children\\u2019s nuggets tomorrow.\\u201d \\u201cIf I was white, I\\u2019d have got seven nuggets.\\u201d That\\u2019s when I backed off. I\\u2019m like, I can\\u2019t help this dude. I\\u2019m like, look, bro, I know you mad and there\\u2019s a lot of racial tension in the world, but this ain\\u2019t racism. This is a fast food spot at 2:00 in the morning. Some of them folks back there can\\u2019t count to six. You want six nuggets, you need to order a four-piece and two-piece. That\\u2019s how you trick they ass and get two sauces for free. [cheers and applause] [chuckles] I like fast food employees. I appreciate the fact that fast food employees are rude. I like it. At least it\\u2019s from the heart. \\u2018Cause people too nice now. You go out to these stores, everybody, \\u201cHey, how you doing? Are you good? Thank you for choosing us.\\u201d You think them people wanna be your friend, or they\\u2019ll get fired for not speaking? Which one you think it is? \\u2018Cause 10, 15 years ago, nobody spoke to you when you went in the store. Now, all of a sudden, everybody wanna kick it with your ass? No! That\\u2019s a corporate mandate, and I\\u2019d rather you not do it. I get in the grocery store. It\\u2019s just too many questions at the register. Just ring up the shit that\\u2019s on the belt. We ain\\u2019t gotta be friends. I\\u2019m here, I\\u2019m spending money, you won. What else do you want? Why I gotta be your friend, too, man?\\u201d The price you pay for politeness is your time. So you want somebody to be nice to you? That\\u2019s cool, enjoy it, but I\\u2019d rather get them minutes back with somebody I know. I don\\u2019t need all this politeness, man, I\\u2019m cool. \\u2018Cause people overdo it. I went on a cruise. This is the weirdest thing ever, man. You go on a cruise, you meet every employee. [scattered laughs] Yeah, you been\\u2013 yeah. Every\\u2013 You go on a cruise\\u2013 I met the captain of the boat. The captain of the cruise ship does laps around the boat every day speaking to people. That\\u2019s too much. I have no need to meet you, sir. Listen, there\\u2019s no\\u2013 At no point in my vacation do I need to meet the highest-ranking officer on the boat. I don\\u2019t need to\\u2013 to do that.

It\\u2019s too much. You go on a cruise, it makes you appreciate airline pilots. I respect airline pilots. Airline pilots ain\\u2019t got no chitchat for you, no small talk before the flight. You don\\u2019t even meet \\u2019em. That\\u2019s the flight attendant\\u2019s job. You get on the plane, who you see first? It\\u2019s the flight attendant. \\u201cWelcome aboard, how are you? Walk in this way\\u2026\\u201d Captain ain\\u2019t got time to talk to your goofy ass. You get on the plane, look in the cockpit, what you see?

Thank you for choosing\\u2013\\u201d [imitates static] That\\u2019s it, that\\u2019s the captain\\u2019s job, to come over the intercom, let you know what\\u2019s happening. That\\u2019s it. No jokes, all business. That\\u2019s why they pause the movie, they stop serving drinks, \\u2019cause the captain got important shit to say. \\u201cLadies and gentlemen, this is the captain. \\u201cWe about to go up in the sky, so sit that ass down \\u201cso we can get up there. \\u201cIf something go wrong, talk to them heifers in the back. \\u201cI can\\u2019t help your ass, \\u2019cause I\\u2019m up here, \\u201cI\\u2019m trying to fly this bitch. \\u201cSo don\\u2019t you come up here. \\u201cMy door\\u2019s locked. I got a shotgun. Fuck with us. Thank you for choosing\\u2013\\u201d [imitates static] [cheers and applause] The captain is all business, and I respect that. He\\u2019s all business until the plane lands. That\\u2019s when he know it\\u2019s time to get some respect from y\\u2019all. The captain knows that he did some dope shit, and he wants you to know he did some dope shit. \\u201cI just flew you 500 miles an hour \\u201cat 30,000 feet, I landed this flight \\u201cin a 50-mile-an-hour crosswind on the first attempt. I want you to know who your God is.\\u201d [laughter and applause] Yeah, the captain want his respect. That\\u2019s why when you get off the plane, the captain be standing in the door like a boss, like, \\u201cWhat\\u2019s up?\\u201d Copilot be next to him, like\\u2026 You can\\u2019t do nothing but show love to the captain.

I\\u2019m trying to lose weight. It\\u2019s hard, man. Losing weight, they tell you everything you need to know about losing weight except for how much it\\u2019s gonna cost. But it\\u2019s hard when it\\u2019s time to lose weight. Drinking all these damn smoothies. And they expensive\\u2013 five, six damn dollars for fruit and ice in a cup, how? How, Sway, how, how? How is it five, six damn dollars for fruit and ice in a cup? And they trick you with smoothies, they try to trick us, \\u2019cause they put all them little extra words and adjectives in the name of the smoothie. Don\\u2019t fall for it.

Hold the Tranquility. That\\u2013 that should knock it down to 3.50. That should get it down. Smoothies so expensive, I\\u2019m surprised rappers don\\u2019t talk about \\u2019em in their songs. Give a damn about a rapper with a damn nice car and some jewelry. You wanna impress me, pour some kale out in the club. Do that. That\\u2019s how I know your ass got some mon\\u2026 \\u266a We drinking kale up in here \\u266a\\n\\u266a We got that kale up in here \\u266a\\n\\u266a People drinking kale up in here \\u266a\\n\\u266a We drinking kale\\u2013 \\u266a There be some girl in a bikini with soy milk just drizzling down. [laughter] I don\\u2019t know about marriage, like\\u2026 A lot of my friends are married, and I\\u2019m at this weird age now, I\\u2019m at this weird age, where, like, I got friends getting married late and I got friends that\\u2019s getting divorced. You know, and I don\\u2019t know who to go celebrate with. This my thing about divorce. What I love about divorce, I love how people won\\u2019t shut the hell up about they wedding, but they divorce is none of your business. That\\u2019s not cool. You running your mouth all this time about your engagement, y\\u2019all break up, what happened? I wanna know, tell me what happened. Especially if I went to the wedding. If I went to your wedding and you divorced, I\\u2019m entitled to a one-page explanation, much money as I spent. Either you tell me why y\\u2019all getting divorced or you give me back the toaster I bought your ass. It\\u2019s a good-ass toaster. That\\u2019s four-slice with the crumb tray, that\\u2019s top-shelf. With a bagel button. You all know about that bagel button, that\\u2019s for ballers. My Uncle Derek told me to watch Titanic. \\u201cYou want to learn how to woo a woman, you got to watch \\u2018Titanics.'\\u201d Country for you, \\u201cTitanics.\\u201d \\u201cYou don\\u2019t know how to woo a woman, boy. \\u201cI\\u2019m telling you, \\u2018Titanics\\u2019 show you. \\u201cThat boy Leo DiCaprio, boy, that boy got that girl, boy, \\u201cand that girl was out of his league, he pulled her. \\u201cAnd then he died, he died happy. \\u201cHe was smiling when he was drowning. He float down smiling.\\u201d I went back and watched Titanic. Titanic is not that romantic of a movie. It\\u2019s a good film, but it ain\\u2019t romantic. Titanic is basically a movie about an old lady who got some dick so good\\u2026 that she went back out into the ocean to say good-bye to it. [laughter] That\\u2019s pretty much the movie. Go back and watch Titanic. The whole thing is a flashback. It\\u2019s a 90-year-old lady and she\\u2019s on the bow of a ship. The whole movie\\u2019s a flashback. It\\u2019s a 90-year-old lady, she\\u2019s looking out into the water and then it flashes back to everything that happened on the ship, he drowns, she lives, they come back present day and she\\u2019s looking out into the water and then people are coming up and talking to her. \\u201cMa\\u2019am, are you\\u2013 are you thinking about all your friends you lost out there?\\u201d \\u201cOh, no, baby, I\\u2019m thinking about that good dick \\u201cthat was down there. \\u201cThere\\u2019s some good dick under that water, \\u201cthat\\u2019s what I\\u2019m thinking about. \\u201cRight here, 70 years ago. \\u201cThis is where I got my back beat out. \\u201cDidn\\u2019t you know that? \\u201cRight here. \\u201cYoung gentleman, poverty-stricken, \\u201cput that pipe on me, I couldn\\u2019t handle it. \\u201cJust steaming up and I was pressing my hand \\u201con that car window, that\\u2019s why I walk like this. Give me the jewelry.\\u201d She threw that jewelry into the water. Titanic ain\\u2019t no romantic movie. If anything, it\\u2019s a superhero movie. It\\u2019s a superhero movie. Leo DiCaprio is a superhero, bro. They had sex one time in that movie. Once. They had sex one time in Titanic. And she remembered it for the next 70 years. [laughter and applause] You know how good your pipe game got to be? To put it down once, one time, and for 70 years, that\\u2019s all she can think about. She\\u2019s 90. Think about how much stuff you probably will forget. I know by the time I\\u2019m 90, I\\u2019m not gonna where my\\u2013 I\\u2019m not gonna know where my car is parked, I\\u2019m not gonna know my grandkids\\u2019 names. I\\u2019m gonna have my pills in that Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday trapdoor. But this lady is 90 and she never forgot that one time\\u2013 His dick beat Alzheimer\\u2019s. That\\u2019s a superpower. You gotta respect that. I like old people, man. I hope\\u2013 I hope I\\u2019m blessed enough to\\u2013 to live long, change the diet up, add a couple years on the back end. You know. Old people, I just\\u2013 I want to get to that age where I can just cuss people out for no reason. You know what I\\u2019m saying? Just unprovoked cussed-outs. Yeah, she already smiling. You almost there? You got\\u2026 No, \\u2019cause you look a little young. You got a little more time, but you just\\u2013 You already trained, you already cuss people now. Yeah, man, you old, you get to just cuss people out for no reason. I was in the grocery store, this old dude rolled up on me, man. \\u201cI was in the struggle, motherfucker.\\u201d \\u201cAnd you weren\\u2019t there!\\u201d I wasn\\u2019t bothering this dude. I\\u2019m in produce, I\\u2019m picking out my Fuji apples. I\\u2019m not bothering nobody, Fuji apples. But he rolled up his sleeve, he showed me the scars. Dude\\u2019s old, 80, 85 years old. \\u201cLook at that scar. Ask me\\u2013 ask me how I got the scar.\\u201d How\\u2019d you get the scar? \\u201cI got it in the struggle, motherfucker.\\u201d \\u201cYou don\\u2019t know what it was like in \\u201962.\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cWhat was it like?\\u201d \\u201cIt was a struggle, you son of a bitch.\\u201d And this is the thing, man, this is the thing with old black people, man, old black people, like, you can\\u2019t disrespect \\u2019em, because they have physical proof that they were willing to die to make the country a better place for me, so I have to salute it. I paid for his groceries. This dude called me motherfucker for 20 minutes. And I paid for his groceries. Just off respect. That got me thinking on the way home\\u2026 you know, what have I done? And that\\u2019s\\u2013 that\\u2019s a very sobering feeling, it\\u2019s a sobering realization to have, to realize that what you\\u2019ve done doesn\\u2019t quite measure up to what that man did, you know? This dude called me motherfucker and got free groceries. That\\u2019s how much he put in work. Like, I know I\\u2019m not gonna get that same result. Like, I wish I could, but I know I\\u2019m not, I\\u2019m\\u2013 \\u2018Cause the thing is that you start reflecting, you start reflecting on what you\\u2019ve done that compares to that and I look at the things that I try to do now. Like, I try my best to be socially active. I try my best to do stuff on \\u201cThe Daily Show\\u201d that affects change, I try. [cheers and applause] But\\u2026 I\\u2019ll be real, a lot of what I do now is just making up for lost time, \\u2019cause I wasn\\u2019t always like that, and that\\u2019s something I\\u2019m ashamed about. I didn\\u2019t go see Obama get inaugurated \\u2019cause it was too cold. That was my excuse. That was my excuse for missing history\\u2013 it\\u2019s cold. And my homeboys called me up, \\u201cWe riding the bus, we going up to D.C., let\\u2019s ride the bus.\\u201d I got cable, man. I didn\\u2019t go the second time. I had four years to buy a coat. And still didn\\u2019t go see him. I skipped history twice. That\\u2019s embarrassing. \\u2018Cause sooner or later, my son\\u2019s gonna be doing a book report on that. And he gonna flip to that Obama inauguration page, and you\\u2019re gonna see those thousands of black people out on the National Mall just standing there, and he\\u2019s gonna come to me and I gotta be accountable for my absence. \\u201cDaddy, were you there?\\u201d Yeah, yeah, I was\\u2026 [laughter and applause] Yeah, I\\u2019m right\\u2013 They cropped me out, I was right there on the side. I just hope that, you know, what I try to do now is enough, you know. That\\u2019s all you can do is what you can do, but I want free groceries. And I\\u2019m not sure if what I did is enough, so I might have to just spice up my story, just add whatever happened. \\u2018Cause when I\\u2019m 80, I\\u2019m gonna go in the grocery store, start cussing out kids. You wasn\\u2019t in the struggle, motherfucker! You don\\u2019t know what it was like in 2017. \\u201cWhat was it like?\\u201d It was a struggle in 2017, motherfucker! We tried to march for police reform, I ordered six nuggets, them white folks only gave me five! I had to pay for two sauces! [cheers and applause] Atlanta, I can\\u2019t thank y\\u2019all enough for the time. Thank y\\u2019all so much for coming out, man. Appreciate y\\u2019all. [cheers and applause] Some shit go down in America them white artists go straight to the studio, pen and pad, right? \\u201cI\\u2019m gonna write a new one!\\u201d \\u266a I got a pet eagle his name is Chuck \\u266a\\n\\u266a I feed him bacon and freedom and I fuckin\\u2019 love Chuck, uh-uh \\u266a \\u00a0 Wrong year!

        "**Differences:**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Low Profanity Usage:** Beth's tendency to avoid profanity in his performances, distinguishing him from comedians like Andrew, Drew, Tom, and Pete, who frequently incorporate profanity into their routines.\n",
        "\n",
