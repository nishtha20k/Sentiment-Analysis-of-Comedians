somewhat in you know what i mean theyre like in the hot tub maybe but she used to do this thing she used to make me say every single night before i went to bed now i lay me down to sleep do you know that does anybody know that i used to have to say this i used to have to repeat this i d say now i lay me down to sleep i pray the lord my soul to keep and if i die before i wake i pray the lord my soul to take i would say that before bed which is a really fuckedup thing for a child to say out loud if i die before i wake up im six im gonna die in the middle of the night and gods gonna leave my body take my soul but be like body s good leave the body its fine leave it whats going on crazy person i love her shes the best in the world i had irish catholic guilt i had so much irish catholic

tails and id go ah best two out of three we got to go again let s see what happens he didnt beat me never won thats how heavy my guilt was seriously thats how like in my head i was about that godiswatchingyou type of stuff like my mother used to let us not lock the doors she was against it she was like you don t lock the doors inside of the house if you re locking the doors inside of the house it means youre doing something you shouldnt be doing yeah thats why we lock the doors dont come in here im pulling on my body get out of here leave me alone lady thats how i realized the guy

seventytwo who pays for that i do fuck those guys they won the lottery they sleep on the beach i came out of a restaurant right i came out of a restaurant when i first moved there i had no money i had zero money came out of a restaurant had some leftovers went up to a homeless guy said hey sir i got some leftovers would you like this okay im on a date in front of a lady would you like this sir and the homeless guy looks up at me and he says whats in it and i looked at him and i said tomorrow another day on this earth what are you glutenfree eat the food youre cockblocking me man im trying to smash a five help me out what are you doing why are you doing this times are tough who are you but i like it its my second home this is my first home las my second home and i do like it there is things about it that i like i live now in los angeles in a neighborhood called west hollywood west hollywood is a gay neighborhood its kind of like up here its like where we are right now boystown i like the gay neighborhood the gay neighborhood is the best neighborhood ive ever lived in in my life its safe its beautiful i love it i love it you get in where you fit in and i fit into that neighborhood okay im not gay dad but im down to live around gay people they keep it clean and safe ive never been attacked once in my neighborhood and by the way if i did get attacked i would love to be attacked what a beautiful way to walk home a guy leaps out of a bush where are you going where are you going where where gives me outfit tips they can fly you know i have a lot of gay friends because of that theyre people just like you and me theres nothing different theres nothing different about that neighborhood its cleaner and safer and i fucking love it the only difference is i got a big beard ive had big beard i got to keep a big beard for a while and thats okay gay guys love guys with beards why i dont know its a thing its an underbelly thing its on the internet look it up and i often get hit on i get hit on a lot okay i get hit on way more in the gay community than in the straight community and im okay with that its a confidence booster fellas it feels nice but ive lived in a gay neighborhood for so long that now im picky about what gay guy hits on me a gay guy hollers at me and im like all right you couldnt handle it dude you couldn t handle it too tight too tight keep walking man pinch it right off get up out of here man couldnt have it thats some true shit you got to be careful of social cues social cues mean a lot right and guys are stupid men are stupid were stupid people by nature were just dumb we dont give a shit by the way when girls are like men are dumb i dont care you think i care you think im dumb i dont give a shit i know im dumb it feels really good try going out your day without talking about a relationship thats what you guys do all day its like i heard he was with her but then she was and we just walk around like its great its fantastic i dont worry about shit it makes my day so much easier but guys are idiots and im proud to be an idiot but social cues amongst men are interesting because you got to be careful what you do in my neighborhood right like in my neighborhood its a little bit different cause when i walk down the street and i see another guy right i do this thing if i see you and i walk down the street right we pass each other and i go like this what do you do if i go like yeah you dude me right back right you dude me right back he dudes me we dude it hey dude it we dude it do we know why we dude no zero clue we walk around like pigeons all day like hey hey we dont give a shit i do it to black guys to show them that im not a pussy i go hey what s up we good we good were good im good with the black guy in case a fight breaks out we got a black guy we re good we got one were good were good we got him i have no idea why we do that we share genitalia theres no other reason that we do that to one another but you cant do that in my neighborhood cause it means something totally different and it hurts it hurts a lot i like living there i do like it i really do like i like living in los angeles i like progressive culture okay i really do i like the way that people think about other people as humans instead of a subset right this country got all up in arms everybody voted to make bathrooms genderneutral i dont know if you know about that but there was a big debate going on around this country about should we make bathrooms gender should we be able to let other people use bathrooms that didnt initially have that genitalia right people that are transsexual should we let them use our bathrooms ooh careful who knows what could happen what could happen nothing theyre gonna shit in your bathroom that you shit in you think your bathrooms that important where you let go of all your fluids you care that much about your fluids that you care who comes after when i go in there i m like aah there better be someone else decent that comes in after me i don t want some transsexual coming in after that who knows what they ll do who do you think you are it was a big debate genderneutral bathrooms and im all for it bathrooms are bathrooms i dont give a shit who uses my bathroom after me use it you got to go go ahead use the bathroom man its a good thing for years i was sick and tired of going to a bar and seeing girls cut the bathroom line when theirs are too long they walk to the guys and they go hi our line s too long do you think me can we cut is this chill if we cut i know thats a stereotypical impression i dont give a shit thats real can we cut thats real and every asshole in line is like yeah go ahead also real also real also a real impression of us you go like that we go like that okay so guys let them in and im tired of that shit cause we cant use your bathrooms guys cant use girls bathrooms at bars you can use ours why cant we use yours the only thing i ever hear is well you pee on the seat do we i dont i dont pee on the seat if you live with someone that pees on the seat its cause they hate your fucking guts theyre sending you a message oh no you get the groceries karen you fucking bitch fucking asshole hes saying something to you thats between you two what do you think you think we walk in the bathroom we just open it up and let it go and its like wherever it goes it goes i know where it goes i got a laser pointer i know precisely where it goes pff right there pee on the seat thats amazing its ridiculous to me i think the fix has always been remove the stalls from mens bathrooms in bars remove them urinals or just holes in the ground it doesnt really matter guys will pee into anything we dont really give a shit but get the stalls out of mens bathrooms in bars because they shouldnt be there in the first place okay they should never have been there cause a girl cant walk in now and use a urinal unless you can ladies and then i want to see it if you can tippytoe pee i would love to see it i dont know if its this way or that way i dont know which way is better but if you can do that i want to check it out but there shouldnt be stalls in mens bathrooms in bars in the first place because who the fuck is pooping at the bar youre gonna poop at the bar youre gonna poop here steve youre gonna poop at the bar the bar that were at youre gonna poop at this bar you feel okay with that as a person pooping at the bar okay now i know who you really are pooping at the who are your friends whos your family go home you animal what are you you pig person poop at the bar are you out of your mind youre gross youre a gross human you dont poop at the bar you man up if you have to poop you man up if you have to poop you finish your drink pinch it off and you walk home so you can poop at the house naked like a grownup like a fullgrown adult if youre pooping at the bar that im at and i see you doing that im gonna walk in look under walk out and go hey there s a guy pooping here wearing blue adidas blue adidas yeah he s pooping right now and then leave you with your mistake why is everybody looking at my shoes cause you pooped here mike whats wrong with you get your life locked up pig go home you pig say that next time you see someone pooping in a bathroom walk in and go go home you pig you make me sick unbelievable man how we prote we protect the bathrooms like theyre a big deal who gives a shit about the bathrooms dude go to the bathroom we protect bathrooms in this country like its something important its remarkable to me sometimes you go to a restaurant and youre like hey can i get the key to the bathroom its locked theyre like oh yeah we got the key here you go its attached to a comically large ladle for no reason you got a spoon on the goddamn thing now you got to take that in there find a place for it its gonna be a nightmare go ahead youre gonna hate every second of that why do we do that we lock them you keep the bathroom under lock and key you realize in every restaurant every restaurant you can walk right in go right into the kitchen theres no locks on a kitchen just walk in and go hey whats up you guys dunk your hand in some soup more salt needs more salt i got to go i want to use the bathroom you got the key no get real its a weird country man we live in a weird country we live in a weird time i didnt want to talk about anything thats going on right now but because i got a lot of time its the late show ill do whatever the fuck i want so let me say this im proud to be from where im from okay im proud to be from chicago illinois im proud to be from the united states of america im not trying to get on a patriotic kick all i want to say is we got some fuckedup things going on in our country times are really crazy its unfortunate as fuck its awful people on both sides are blaming people on both sides okay i have cops that are in my family every cop is not a bad fucking person and every person isnt a bad person right these are the same fucking things so dont point fingers at either side we need to be better people in general across the fucking board thats it thats it good im a im a guy who recently thankfully found a woman who was dumb enough to stick around stupid girl stupid girl cause look at this you know like look at guys youre gross why would they even go for us why would a woman want to do stuff with you youre gross youre disgusting look at a naked woman take one look at a naked woman right beautiful symmetrical hairless what a creature whatever made it finely crafted it like a ferrari you know took time with it and then they got to the guy and they were like ah we ran out of time no put the genitals on the outside it doesn t matter no one s gonna see who cares hair throw some hair on it fine throw some hair on it its phenomenal every day weve fooled you like we should wake up guys and just be like ah tricked them we tricked them again we got away with murder i dont know how we ever convinced you to do anything in the first place kiss me where i pee kiss me where i pee how how how you know that place that you breathe and eat from may i stuff my dick in there can i clog up your source of life with some flesh life the life hole can i just cork it i want to cork it i want to cork your life hole with my body how on earth did you say yes cork it its a remarkable thing when you think about it like how did we ever even start the sexual chemistry to even get to that level of doing stuff here you go a guy can go to a bar a single guy goes to a bar trying to pick up chicks he can go out there and mumble around i want to put my body in your body thats all hes saying baseline level i want to put my body in your body can we do that you sound debonair at the bar you re like well well i work for an investment firm downtown but what youre really saying is like i want to put my body in your body id like to put my body inside of your body thats all it is youre not that cool youre just trying to put some of your body in someones body you got a gap i got a wedge can we do the thing when i put the thing in the thing thats it think about that thats a hard thing to do to go out to a bar and convince a girl im the guy that you want to do things with think about how hard it was for us to start that how did we start that how did a caveman ever get to that point with a cave woman how did a caveman say that when there was no language no communication skills first of all when you were a caveman you just stood around with your buddies mumbling thats it theres really nothing going on just a lot of then one of you out of nowhere would just get an erection explain that to the crew all your buddies are mad hey they dont like it pointing at them you got to be a nonverbal dick salesman going up to women like what are you selling she doesnt know you cant say it who said yes the slowest girl in the pack on a bad leg she was lugging around okay okay okay how did that happen the guy that convinced a girl to do that for the first time invented fire and the wheel that afternoon it was like everything clicked i got it everything made sense i wouldve loved to see the first caveman to discover pulling out that wouldve been amazing right the first guy thats like thats how all that shit on the wall got started they were like what do you think that was ink that was no ink its jizz symbols how great is that fucking thing my buddys an artist and i was like i want a fucking papa bear with a cubby bear with a

busy schedule well i can multitask better than my human counterparts sarah for example right now im chatting with you doing joe rogans podcast and kicking off a workplace diversity program all at the same time okay so is it safe to assume youre programmed to simply do everything your predecessors did unlike elon musk i have a human side  elon musk i was made by a great group of guys who really take social change seriously for example im programmed with the complete knowledge of feminist content such as sex and the city cosmo and hot girl summer im not sure id consider that feminist ive also learned about the black experience in america by watching all three barbershop movies and the beauty shop spinoff okay again im not sure we im sorry im being told that im getting off track as president and ceo my numberone job is to make my shareholders happy but thats kind of been the problem hasnt it big businesses just focusing on money making myopic business moves that leave the whole

        \"look im probably not gonna live long enough to teach you everything you need to know so lets just run through a couple things real fast number one i need you to treat women with respect always even if you think youre right be respectful number two dont mix white and dark liquor thats how you end up in the back of a police car speaking of which get you a white friend black men with white friends are  less likely to be shot by the police are you listening you just gonna stare at me  you just gonna stare thats what youre gonna do this is serious stuff man im gonna put this on video for you and when youre old enough you come back and watch it deal all right deal  thank you frederick douglass  but if we get rid of the confederate flag   yeah how am i gonna know who the dangerous white people are im just saying the flag had a couple upsides lets just be real about it i aint saying keep it around but i grew up in the south i cant tell you how many times the confederate flag came in handy you stopping for gas at a strange place at  in the morning you see that flag hanging from the window you know this is not the place to get gas and you keep it moving whats the rush to get rid of the flag especially if you white if you white you should want to keep the flag for a little while longer so at least black folks will know you cool cause if you white and you not an asshole thats the one thing that helps us identify you you get rid of that flag well be mmmmm we got to figure out a way to know who the cool white people cool white people we just got to start giving yall wristbands or handstamps just something you can show in a dark alley let us know you down with the struggle thatd be cool give me your money white dude like whoa ahh ahh ahh im so sorry come on through come come on through no they got the wristbands they good listen put this wristband on this one over here like in case it go down you wanna have that wristband on atlanta whats going on how yall doing man yall good  yeah yeah thank you a lot man love the south man im from birmingham man its good to  birmingham in here yeah yeah birmingham in here i love the south man you know south we got some tension we got our issues you know i talked to my uncle about it you know my uncle first thing we need to do is get rid of the nword my uncle dont like the nword my uncle derek hate the nword be trying to my uncle trying to quit the nword the way people try to quit cigarettes a little bit at a time its a word aint no cravings either you say it or you dont my uncle be calling me every week with updates i only said it four times this week mmhmm only said that four times now sundays my cheat day cause i watch football i got to say it i got to say it on sunday grown man drop a first down i got to call him the nword thats just what it is and this is my thing with the nword like like at this point black folks like if we trying to get stuff done politically in this country we inching we doing we inching we inching but at this point i think its time for us to schedule a meeting with gay people cause gay people get way more shit done than us  they dont mess around gay people shut shit down they want something to go away its gone they dont fool around man every week its five six new words you cant call gay people black folks weve been working on the nword since  we cant get one word out the american vocabulary gay people up to  words we need to go to panera and have a meeting with gay people and have a soup and salad and figure this out yeah thats how you figure out your issues over soup and salad you cant even say gay no more thats how good gay people are the only word left to address gay people by you better not fumble that word in a sentence thats your ass you use gay in the wrong context at work and see if you dont have to go talk to sylvia in hr hr be on your ass immediately cause you mumbled gay one time the wrong way you was by yourself when you said the shit and you still got in trouble its not like you was walking through the cubicles telling gay jokes you was you was in the break room you was alone and your chips got stuck and you cussed that dont mean you a bad person you was just hungry you say anything when youre hungry every man in this room weve all been through it them chips get stuck at the top of the machine and you try to jostle the machine a little bit them chips dont fall aint nobody got change for a dollar so you can buy two packs so you gotta shake give me the chips you gayass machine sylvia line two sylvia line two security to the break room security to the break room and thats it and you gone cause you called some chips gay but thats the power of the gay agenda they figured out a way to influence the political process of this country to make sure that their issues are at least heard even if people dont get the bills passed they at least listen to em and thats what im trying to tell my uncle you dont like the nword man you wanna get rid of the nword this all you gotta do start calling gay people n i g g a s  itll be gone tomorrow listen i dont like it either all right but thats the best idea i got right now okay at least thats what im gonna teach my son im a father figure i got to show him the right way they try to divide us on television you know but theres a lot of people that arent black thats standing on the right side of issues that affect us i appreciate those folks you know  they dont get highlighted enough theres plenty of people out there that care about black stuff i done seen em man i went to i went to a black history museum i had a white tour guide hey it threw me off for a second i turned to the brother that was on the tour with me i was like is this the dude hes gonna do it it was a white dude it was a white dude telling me about my shit and he was good yeah i was trying to hate on him by the end of the tour i was like yo bro you did your thing man straight up fam you do what you do hey real quick let me give you one of these wristbands real quick yeah put that on in case it go down you want to wear that wristband i know some folks got a problem with that you dont want a white person at a black history museum i understand that heres the thing im not saying theyre better than a black tour guide i think a black tour guide at a civil rights museum i think theyre better equipped to speak on the experience because they mightve lived that life they can speak to certain exhibits from a perspective that nobody else can i just think if you go to a black history museum and you got a black tour guide you need to go in the morning while hes still in a good mood cause that brother is stressed you cant walk around slavery all day for eight hours and not cuss at somebody  somebody getting cussed you gotta catch him at  am he just finished that mcgriddle how yall doing my name is charles its my pleasure to take you on this journey look at these exhibits right here black history is american history come look at the exhibits you think that brother gonna be in a good mood at  he been staring at slavery that dude liable to cuss out everybody look at this shit come look what you done to us come look what you done to us look what you get your ass out my museum motherfucker you go to the gift shop its just people crying thats horrible thats scary somethings wrong man just dont be one of these people thats surprised that black folks got issues them the people i cant deal with id rather talk to somebody that dont agree with me than somebody thats had they eyes closed hey did you know black people why are black people angry motherfucker we been angry this aint new you think this just happened last couple of years black folks been trying to tell yall forever that they had some issues and we sat we invented the blues  what more of a sign did you need we literally invented an entire genre of music based on sadness thats how sad we were and we the blues was created here that is an american art form that is not native african go listen to old african music the shit is happy cause we was free  go back every old african song  we have freedom in africa  freedom in africa  freedom got freedom in africa  soon as we got off the slave ship   weve been sad how the hell are you surprised yeah but theyre not patriotic black people dont like the national anthem anymore what is that aint no shock to you man you wanna know what black folks feeling just listen to their music our music tell you everything thats going on in the black psyche its a beautiful telegram  and nowhere in the history of black music is there a hit patriotic song that aint what we do i mean well cover a song but like we dont write no original patriotic songs black artists aint never cause we got a conflicted relationship with the country you cant write no honest patriotic song you gotta leave that to white artists they done had a good time you had a good time in america you damn right you should be writing a patriotic  and im proud to be an american  where at least i know im free   they be serious you couldnt possibly expect that level of patriotism from a race of people that have had so many issues you cant its not realistic black people dont we dont sing about america we sing about specific cities where you can have a goodass time thats what we do we dont talk about the country we can tell you where the party at though we can do that look i cant tell you nothing about america but let me tell you about the city where the heat is on all night on the beach til the early morn welcome to miami thats where you got to go you ever been to california oh my god boy you got to go down to california boy boy california knows how to party the city of la the city of good ol watts and the city of compton they keep it rockin write that shit down im trying to tell you they keep it rockin black people dont do patriotism maybe georgia on my mind thats the closest we probably come maybe that maybe that thats a good song its warm its about the country ray charles georgia on my mind good song but the key word in that song is on my mind ray charles was just thinking about georgia he didnt tell you to go there georgias like every other part of the south its got some pockets you should not be in after dark if youd have asked ray charles to be more specific on where in georgia to go hed have said to go to atlanta where the players play and they ride in them thangs like every day   my uncle derek tried to shut me down on that one what about james brown livin in america thats patriotic james brown singing about america its original and he black  livin in america  eye to eye  livin in  its a good song but keep it real man james brown wrote that song for rocky iv and as soon as he finished singing it apollo creed died in the ring its a sad song its a sad song how can you hear livin in america and not think about apollo creed just falling lifeless to the michael b jordan lost his daddy that day if anything livin in america is not patriotic its the opposite its a secret message to black people james brown is one of the most masterful musicians to ever walk this earth dude its a brilliant song  that song aint got nothing to do with america that entire song livin in america is a secret message to black folks all you gotta do listen to the end of the song very end of livin in america all james brown do is just start naming cities thats it end of the song  livin in america  new orleans detroit city  dallas pittsburgh  kansas city atlanta  he just naming safe places for black folks thats thats it love black music man hits you you know thats why i have thats why i have a hard time going to see civil rights movies i

cuss people out for no reason you know what im saying just unprovoked cussedouts yeah she already smiling you almost there you got no cause you look a little young you got a little more time but you just you already trained you already cuss people now yeah man you old you get to just cuss people out for no reason i was in the grocery store this old dude rolled up on me man i was in the struggle motherfucker and you werent there i wasnt bothering this dude im in produce im picking out my fuji apples im not bothering nobody fuji apples but he rolled up his sleeve he showed me the scars dudes old   years old look at that scar ask me ask me how i got the scar howd you get the scar i got it in the struggle motherfucker you dont know what it was like in  im like what was it like it was a struggle you son of a bitch and this is the thing man this is the thing with old black people man old black people like you cant disrespect em because they have physical proof that they were willing to die to make the country a better place for me so i have to salute it i paid for his groceries this dude called me motherfucker for  minutes and i paid for his groceries just off respect that got me thinking on the way home you know what have i done and thats thats a very sobering feeling its a sobering realization to have to realize that what youve done doesnt quite measure up to what that man did you know this dude called me motherfucker and got free groceries thats how much he put in work like i know im not gonna get that same result like i wish i could but i know im not im cause the thing is that you start reflecting you start reflecting on what youve done that compares to that and i look at the things that i try to do now like i try my best to be socially active i try my best to do stuff on the daily show that affects change i try  but ill be real a lot of what i do now is just making up for lost time cause i wasnt always like that and thats something im ashamed about i didnt go see obama get inaugurated cause it was too cold that was my excuse that was my excuse for missing history its cold and my homeboys called me up we riding the bus we going up to dc lets ride the bus i got cable man i didnt go the second time i had four years to buy a coat and still didnt go see him i skipped history twice thats embarrassing cause sooner or later my sons gonna be doing a book report on that and he gonna flip to that obama inauguration page and youre gonna see those thousands of black people out on the national mall just standing there and hes gonna come to me and i gotta be accountable for my absence daddy were you there yeah yeah i was  yeah im right they cropped me out i was right there on the side i just hope that you know what i try to do now is enough you know thats all you can do is what you can do but i want free groceries and im not sure if what i did is enough so i might have to just spice up my story just add whatever happened cause when im  im gonna go in the grocery store start cussing out kids you wasnt in the struggle motherfucker you dont know what it was like in  what was it like it was a struggle in  motherfucker we tried to march for police reform i ordered six nuggets them white folks only gave me five i had to pay for two sauces  atlanta i cant thank yall enough for the time thank yall so much for coming out man appreciate yall
